2018-06-01,Jeremy Thorpe 'hit-man might not be dead',https://web.archive.org//web/20180602113014/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-44336859,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowA probe into a scandal involving former Liberal leader Jeremy Thorpe will be reopened after police may have wrongly assumed one of the suspects was dead.A 2015 investigation into the alleged attempted murder of his lover - Norman Scott - was closed in 2017. Gwent Police assumed Andrew Newton - who shot Mr Scott's dog and claimed he was paid to kill Mr Scott - had died. But they now say he may still be alive. Mr Scott said he thought police were ""continuing the cover up"". The revelations have been unearthed in the BBC Four documentary The Jeremy Thorpe Scandal. BBC Panorama journalist Tom Mangold, who has investigated the case since the 1970s, said the investigation had ended because police claimed Newton was dead.Mr Mangold said it ""must start again"" and he ""wouldn't be surprised at all"" if Newton was alive, adding: ""When I knew Newton he was a fit, young man.""Claims that police altered the evidence of another person being hired to kill Mr Scott before Newton, a small-time air pilot, were unearthed by Mr Mangold in 2014, the year Mr Thorpe died. Dennis Meighan said he was approached by associates of Mr Thorpe, and Newton, to carry out the murder. This led to Gwent Police reopening the investigation, but after they concluded Newton was dead, the Crown Prosecution Service told Mr Scott no further action would be taken. Mr Scott, 78, said: ""I just don't think anyone's tried hard enough to look for him. I really don't. ""I thought [Gwent Police] were doing something at last and soon found out that absolutely they weren't, they were continuing the cover up as far as I can see.""Gwent Police said after revisiting some enquiries, investigators ""identified information, which indicates that Newton may still be alive"". ""As a result, further enquiries will be conducted to trace Newton to assess if he is able to assist the investigation.""The programme includes unearthed footage from a Panorama programme from 1979 that was never broadcast for legal reasons, after Mr Thorpe and his three co-defendants were acquitted of conspiracy to murder.The director general at the time kept a master copy of the programme but ordered all other copies to be destroyed. But veteran reporter Tom Mangold kept his copy of the report.The programme will air after the end of the dramatisation A Very British Scandal, which stars Hugh Grant as Jeremy Thorpe and Ben Whishaw as Norman Scott.The Jeremy Thorpe Scandal will be broadcast on Sunday at 22:00 BST."

On Friday, Mrs May said she was ""disappointed"" at the US decision - which will see a 25% duty on European steel and a 10% duty on European aluminium - and that the taxes were ""unjustified"".  Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Dr Fox said the UK was still seeking exemptions from the tariffs.""We will still be making that case throughout this week,"" he said. He added: ""The United States believes, I believe wrongly and illegally, that this is a national security matter for the US.""Given that we export some pretty complex steel products to the United States which are part of their national security programmes themselves, this reasoning that is given is wrong and therefore we believe unlawful.""President Trump originally imposed the tariffs in March, claiming that if the US remained reliant on imported metals, it would threaten the country's national security and damage its own metal industry.He initially exempted Canada, Mexico and the EU from the tariffs to allow time for negotiations. However, the exemption ended at midnight on Thursday, meaning the new taxes would be collected from Friday. Dr Fox travelled to Washington in March to seek a further exemption for the UK but was unsuccessful. Earlier this week, he called the tariff proposals ""disappointing"" and ""absurd"".Dr Fox's comments follow those of EU trade commissioner, Cecilia Malmstrom, who also called the new tariffs illegal and said the US was playing a ""dangerous game"". French President Emmanuel Macron backed the position, telling President Trump the duties were illegal over the telephone. But Dr Fox warned against a ""tit-for-tat"" escalation in the light of EU counter measures, adding: ""There can be no victors in a trade war, only casualties.""   The EU has issued a 10-page list of tariffs on US goods, ranging from Harley Davidson motorcycles to bourbon."

Nominations opened on Friday and the result will be announced in September.Ms Lucas, the party's only MP and best-known politician, announced earlier this week that she would not be standing for re-election, and would be ""focusing even more"" on her work in Parliament and her constituency.Across the 150 councils holding elections in May, the Greens ended with 39 councillors, a net gain of eight seats - but lost five of their 10 seats in Norwich.At the time Ms Lucas acknowledged her party had been ""hurt"" by voters moving to Jeremy Corbyn's Labour but said they had ""held our own and made some significant gains"".

Mr Farage, one of the most polarising figures in British politics, has become a well-known figure in the US due to regular appearances on Fox News and his outspoken support for President Donald Trump.Now it appears that the MEP is trying to break new ground down under, with a week of shows in Perth, Brisbane, Adelaide, Sydney and Melbourne.He will also be visiting New Zealand for a show in Auckland. The tour website describes the controversial politician as the ""face"" of the Brexit campaign to leave the EU who is ""widely consulted"" for his views on international political issues and populist revolts against the political establishment.Mr Farage, who has tried unsuccessfully to get elected to the UK Parliament, will lose his seat in the European Parliament next year when the UK leaves the European Union.The European Parliament is in recess during Mr Farage's Antipodean tour, its first autumn plenary session will begin on 10 September. Overseas speaking engagements continue to prove lucrative for a select group of leading British politicians.In January, it emerged wealthy business people in China were being offered the opportunity to have dinner with former prime minister David Cameron and be pictured with him for £12,000.Former chancellor George Osborne was paid £80,000 for a single two-hour speech in New York in 2016.He recently notched up what is believed to be his eighth job since leaving office.

It follows a warning by the mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, that an ""emergency"" timetable was being considered to deal with the scale of train cancellations and delays.Mr Burnham said the introduction of an emergency timetable was ""unacceptable"".""The travelling public are having their lives turned upside down."" Northern managing director David Brown said: ""We have been experiencing some significant disruption to train services, especially around north Manchester, Bolton, Liverpool, Blackpool and up to the Lake District.""He apologised for the ""unacceptable situation"" and ""unacceptable service many customers have been subject to"".Mr Brown added: ""We are absolutely committed to resolving the service issues and the interim plan will help ensure we start to get back on track and start to give customers more certainty around the services we operate.""The Transport Secretary Chris Grayling cited government-owned Network Rail - which manages the rail infrastructure - for the problems.He said it was ""too late in finalising planned timetable changes"" which have caused widespread problems since they were introduced.The RMT's general secretary Mick Cash said the minister should ""get out"" and described the situation as ""carnage"".Mr Cash said his members are facing public anger ""without a shred of support"" from Mr Grayling or Northern's management.He said it was ""disgusting"" that Mr Grayling and bosses of rail companies have ""dived for cover"" and not faced passengers.""Not only is Chris Grayling incompetent and not fit to run a railway but he is a coward as well, leaving RMT members to take the flack for failed policies that are his responsibility,"" he said.In response, the transport secretary issued a statement which said: ""I am in regular discussions with Network Rail, Northern and Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR), and have reiterated that disruption suffered by passengers is wholly unacceptable.""I have been very clear with Network Rail that it was far too late in finalising planned timetable changes and this must not happen again.""Train companies are working to keep passengers moving and disruption minimised. ""While this is currently a huge inconvenience to passengers as the changes bed in, we are investing in the biggest modernisation of the railway since Victorian times and this new timetable will deliver hundreds more services up and down the country.""Earlier this week, Mr Grayling wrote to MPs over the ""wholly unsatisfactory"" service on GTR in the south of England and Northern.He also criticised Network Rail, saying it ""cannot cope"" with the workload, and its performance was ""simply unacceptable"".Wigan MP Lisa Nandy said Mr Grayling would meet with MPs on Monday when the Transport Select Committee will review the Northern and GTR franchises.Last month's timetable update included many more changes than normal in an attempt to improve punctuality and account for extra services and capacity following billions of pounds of investment.The timing of all GTR and most Northern trains was changed, but all the new journeys needed to be individually approved by Network Rail, which is responsible for managing infrastructure.Are you a Northern passenger?

""But with this news, it seems the cost will be paid by others while the former chancellor suns himself in his luxury home in France.""The former chancellor looks like a hypocrite.""Lord Lawson, who lives in a country house in Gers, south-west France, told BBC News: ""It is well known that I live in France and have done so for many years and have referred to this in the House of Lords and elsewhere. ""It was the French authorities who told me that I should apply for a carte de sejour. Nothing else has changed.""A carte de sejour shows a person is legally resident in France and it is hoped possession of such documentation will help avoid complications after Brexit.In his interview with Connexion, an English-language French magazine for expats, Lord Lawson said he believes the issue of Britons living in other EU countries will be sorted out in Brexit talks but that trade was a ""problem"", along with the Irish border issue.""I think the issue could be no trade deal. There will be agreement on expats and security,"" he said.""It's not helped by the fact the current government is weak and is not doing a particularly good job. But that's a fact of life.""I think the most likely outcome is initially no trade deal, then after Britain is fully out of the EU and passions have cooled there will be agreement at a future date.""Asked if he had applied for  a carte de sejour, Lord Lawson said: ""Yes I've just started, and don't know how it will work out, but am not particularly worried. ""It comes under the category of 'tiresome' rather than 'serious'. I understand some people are worried about healthcare cover and hope it will be sorted out. ""Speaking as a Brit in France - and I'm not applying for French nationality - I am not worried.""Lord Lawson said said Brexit would provide benefits to Britain but it depended on the policies of the government of the day.""There are things we'd like to do that we can't now because we don't have the autonomy. But that control can be used competently or not.""If it is, I believe the UK will benefit increasingly over the years, if not, we'll suffer."" "

The Labour leader's office then sent a reminder to Labour MPs of the party's commitment to ban unpaid internships.Mr Umunna, who has criticised Mr Corbyn in the past and who is opposed to the party's policy on Brexit, has campaigned for fairer wages for the low paid.The ad, for a year in industry student placement, which was circulated to students at Leeds University, listed duties such as ""administrative support"", organising ""a wide variety of policy issues and constituent enquiries"" and ""EU campaign work"".It said the placement was unpaid but the cost of a student travel card - worth about £1,000 a year - will be covered.Hi @KaneEmerson.

""The scheme, and others like it, are run collaboratively by MPs and universities, and gives students supported work experience as part of their university degree. ""In addition to the student finance students receive while undertaking a placement, as detailed in the advert, my office will reimburse travel expenses for a student travel card to minimise expenses. 'I do not and would not offer a long-term placement where a student is not supported and left financially penalised. ""Unfortunately, (MPs' expenses body)  IPSA do not provide additional resources for MPs to recruit interns on a paid basis, though the Parliamentary Labour Party has always argued strongly for them to do so.""The Labour leadership responded to the row by sending a message to all of its MPs, saying: ""This is a reminder to all MPs that it is against Labour Party policy to employ unpaid interns.""The message includes a link to Labour's 2017 general election manifesto.Tanya de Grunwald, founder of the Graduate Fog website and a campaigner for fair internships, said: ""Rightly or wrongly, there is a loophole in the minimum wage law which means students need not be paid when doing a 'Year in Industry' placement as credit for their university course. So, legally Chuka has not done anything wrong.""However, big ethical questions remain. Is it right that this person won't be paid, when they will clearly bring great value to his office? Is it okay that someone else being denied this as a paid job, because Chuka can fill it with an unpaid student? ""And why are students paying university tuition fees in order to be sent out to work for free?"" "

In line with the formal two-year timetable for the Brexit talks, the UK and the EU are planning on reaching a deal in the autumn, which will then be voted on by MPs in parliament.An open letter, co-ordinated by anti-Brexit campaign group Wales For Europe and signed by 31 senior Welsh politicians, urges ""everyone in Wales of goodwill, from all parties and none, to stand with us in calling on our MPs to pledge their support for a people's vote on the final Brexit deal.""The letter said: ""Will it be the right deal for the people of Wales and the rest of the UK? Will it secure a good future for our young people and allow them to thrive? Will it help protect and grow the number of well-paid, highly-skilled, jobs that Wales needs?""It is signed by eight council leaders, two of Wales' four MEPs, and 12 of the 40 Welsh MPs, including Owen Smith who was fired as shadow Northern Ireland secretary by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn for calling for another EU referendum against party policy.Welsh Labour MPs Anna McMorrin and Tonia Antoniazzi have signed the letter despite being shadow parliamentary private secretaries who are expected to follow the party's line. Nine AMs have also put their name to the letter, including Plaid Cymru Leader Leanne Wood, Labour Welsh Government Local Government Secretary Alun Davies and Education Secretary Kirsty Williams, a Liberal Democrat.Mr Smith told BBC Good Morning Wales that people now have a ""deeper understanding"" of what Brexit means and he feels confident they may change their votes once they see the final deal. ""We've been discussing [Brexit] for the last almost three years,"" he said. ""I think there is now a very deep understanding in the public's mind as to what the trade-offs are, what the compromises are, and what some of the downsides are.""Now the people are better informed, now that the complexity is more revealed, we can have a more complete view from the country and in my view, I think you might well see people change their mind.""Mr Davies accused the UK government of being in chaos and said he had no trust in its ""ability to bring back a deal that will meet the needs of the people of Wales"".""That means the people of Wales have to have the opportunity to vote on what the UK government does bring back,"" he said.He said that he would hope to hold the second referendum before March next year, which is the point when Article 50 ends and the UK is set to leave the EU. ""It was poised on a knife edge, that vote, and in many parts of the country, people didn't vote for it,"" he added. ""It was an instruction to start the negotiations, but I don't think it was necessarily an instruction to the politicians on what the absolute outcome ought to be. ""All of those things that we were promised have turned out to be empty promises and the downsides have now been revealed.""I think in light of that, the sensible thing is to allow the people of Wales the chance to say whether they actually want to go through with this.""First Minister Carwyn Jones has consistently said that he does not want to re-run the referendum campaign and that Wales and the UK should respect the will of the public vote.Asked to clarify the Welsh Government's position on a second vote, a spokeswoman said: ""The First Minister's priority remains securing the best deal possible for the people of Wales and the UK.""The Labour MP for Aberavon, Stephen Kinnock, was asked to sign up to the letter but refused.Mr Kinnock added: ""I've been campaigning for an EEA-based Brexit solidly for over 18 months. If I were to now start supporting a campaign that's designed to reverse Brexit before 29 March then the credibility of my EEA arguments would be fatally undermined.""By arguing to reverse Brexit I would effectively be forfeiting my right to have a voice in shaping it.""Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies said the first minister had lost all authority after announcing plans to stand down later this year, and ministers were now ""freewheeling and publicly advocating positions which are against official Welsh Government policy"".""Jeremy Corbyn sacked Owen Smith for far less - and there are now serious questions over Carwyn Jones's ability to lead his party and his government as we enter a key period in the Brexit negotiations,"" Mr Davies added.  In a recent lecture for the campaign group 'Wales For Europe', the Welsh Government's lead on Brexit Mark Drakeford said a referendum ""is only one way in which the acceptability or otherwise of such a final deal could be tested"".But he added that ""now is not the moment to be over-definitive about the nature of the question that we would pose at such a point nor the way in which that question would be resolved""."

The joint committee welcomed the government's approach to fix the problems in the Act but raised concerns about ""related areas of discrimination in British nationality law"" - including the status of people whose parents were not married - or where the father was not a BOT citizen.The joint committee said that the UK Parliament could legislate for BOT citizenship rules and it was ""difficult to see"" why they had not been amended in the British Nationality Act, alongside the rules for other British citizens.""Such discrimination should not be allowed to persist,"" the report said.""We consider it unacceptable that discrimination in acquiring British nationality persists (including for British Overseas Territories citizenship) depending on whether a person's father or mother was a British Overseas Territories citizen, or whether or not their parents were married.""This type of discrimination in the British Nationality Act should be remedied for all types of British nationality and we recommend that the home secretary take urgent steps to bring forward legislation to do so.""  One campaigner told the committee: ""The matter is pretty straightforward to most sensible people, and in today's modern forward-thinking society, this matter should have been rectified a long time ago. ""Children now adults should never be made to feel they are 'less-than' under the law, especially when it comes to claiming the parents' heritage and citizenship by descent."" Immigration Minister Caroline Noakes told the committee: ""Any amendments to persons entitled to be registered as British Overseas Territory citizens will require consultation with the Overseas Territories and this is now on our agenda. ""I am grateful to the committee for bringing this to my attention. I will ask my officials to consider this for the next draft of the Remedial Order in consultation with representatives in the BOTCs."""

In the last 12 months it has grown 1.2% compared with 2.2% in the US and 2.5% in the eurozone.Mr Staley said measures might include looking at how big a loan Barclays would be prepared to provide as a percentage of the value of a residential property - the so called loan to value ratio - particularly in London and the South East. He arrived in north east England today with an encouraging message for local business - announcing a new £500m fund for loans to small and medium sized businesses. But his warning on the UK economy, and Barclays' risk appetite, was the more telling content for a bank with over a £1 trillion in UK loans.  The government has always accepted that businesses - particularly foreign ones - will be cautious about investing in the UK while Brexit is under discussion. A group of European industrialists told the Prime Minister as much at a meeting yesterday at Number 10 on Wednesday.

Downing Street has defended Mrs May's approach and pointed to the prime minister's decision to establish a racial disparity audit and her appointment of Sajid Javid as the first home secretary from an ethnic minority.In its letter, The Muslim Council of Great Britain names Harrow East MP Bob Blackman, saying he had retweeted a post on Twitter by former English Defence League leader Tommy Robinson and had hosted events in Parliament which a controversial Hindu nationalist attended.At the time of the events, Labour and the MCB said Tapan Ghosh held ""abhorrent"" views about Muslims.Mr Blackman said he did not regret sharing a platform with him, but did not agree with Tweets sent by Mr Ghosh about Muslims. Mr Ghosh has also insisted he is not Islamophobic.In a statement on Thursday Mr Blackman said he ""utterly refutes"" any allegations of Islamophobia.""I did not host Tapan Ghosh in Parliament. He was invited by an organisation without my knowledge. In the past I shared a social media post in error which I apologised for at the time. I will continue working with all communities in my constituency and I condemn Islamophobia,"" he said.The letter, sent by the MCB's secretary-general Harun Khan, calls for the Tories to ""publish a list of incidents of Islamophobia within the party where action has already been taken"", and ""adopt a programme of education and training on Islamophobia"".Lastly, Mr Khan asks that the party ""reaffirm from the highest level a commitment against bigotry wherever it is found"".  Responding to the letter, a Conservative spokesman said: ""We take all such incidents seriously, which is why we have suspended all those who have behaved inappropriately and launched immediate investigations.""

Her tumour - Glioblastoma Multiforme - is the most common and deadliest brain tumour - three in four people diagnosed with her type of brain cancer are dead within a year.  Despite this, it has received less than 2% of research funding and has had no significant new treatments for 50 years. Brain cancer is becoming more common, and the UK has one of the lowest survival rates in Western Europe.Her daughter, Jess, said in the documentary: ""The only time I've seen mum cry since she got ill, she was sat in the waiting room and had what she described as the absolutely heart-breaking realisation that those who had that privilege of access or income may well live longer because of that, and those that didn't may well die much sooner because of it. ""And in her words, that is just the most despicable example of inequality. In those moments, her mission was really identified.""Tessa Jowell: Her Last Campaign will air on Monday 4 June at 7.30pm on BBC One.

""We've been left in limbo,"" says Fiona Godfrey, a freelance legal consultant living with her family in Luxembourg who also volunteers with the pressure group British in Europe. ""I think it's shameful. We should never ever have been put in this position."" The dilemma is that what has been agreed so far between the UK government and the EU - in the Withdrawal Agreement they are negotiating - will only give British citizens the right to live and work in the country where they reside. In Fiona's case, that means tiny Luxembourg. But at the moment she works in other countries every week, relying on her rights of freedom of movement within the EU single market. ""In 20 years I've worked in every EU member state, plus Norway and Switzerland,"" she says. ""We want to keep the rights we have - we need to keep our free movement, we need to keep our rights to work, and we need to keep recognition of our professional qualifications, because that is another huge issue.""Some UK citizens in the EU will be able to continue to work as they do now. If, for example, you are defined as a frontier worker - crossing a border on a regular basis for a nine-to-five job on a regular employment contract - then you should be OK. But if you are defined as a cross-border supplier of services there is no guarantee as yet that you'll be able to work after Brexit as you do now.  New restrictions could apply to all sorts of people:  lawyers, architects, truckers… or freelance chefs cooking for hungry skiers in the French Alps.""It's been very stressful. Nearly two years now, and we still have no clarity on what is going to happen and how we are going to be affected,"" says Helen Malaburn, speaking from her home near Les Trois Vallees in France. She and her husband have lived there for 10 years, cooking for tourists and local residents during the winter ski season. But in the summer, the work dries up, and they spend their time working in places like Greece and Spain. ""At the moment, we do approximately half of our work outside France,"" Helen says. ""There's no way we could sustain ourselves on the winter work that we do.""""We're completely dependent on being able to work across the EU, and having our qualifications (as chefs) recognised in every country, like they are now."" Helen and Fiona are not alone. The debate about UK citizens living in the EU often focuses on pensioners seeking warmer weather - and they certainly have concerns of their own. But roughly 80% of the one million or so Brits in the EU are of working age or younger.There is a lack of clarity on a number of other issues that concern them. It is still not clear, for example, whether UK citizens in the EU will have access to university education on the same financial terms as they do now; nor whether - as part of a bureaucratic process - they will have to make new applications to remain in the countries where they live. One solution to the dilemma facing so many people is to apply for dual citizenship. Both Helen and Fiona are in the process of doing so, as are many of their British counterparts. But it's not an option available in every country - Austria and the Netherlands, for example, don't allow it and other countries have some restrictions. Nor is there a guarantee of success, and the application process takes time. And that is the one thing that is now in short supply. The European Parliament has promised to take a tough line on protecting citizens' rights, and the Dutch MEP Sophie in 't Veld is critical of both sides in the Brexit negotiations.  ""They're making it into a legalistic issue,"" she says, ""but this is about the fundamental rights of people who have set up their lives here in Europe and are counting on free movement.""So this is a condition for the European Parliament to give its consent to the Withdrawal Agreement.""Does she think the European Parliament would otherwise struggle to approve the agreement (which it has to do before Brexit happens)? ""Yes. We have adopted a series of resolutions where we set out our conditions for giving consent, and this is one of them.""So when can UK citizens expect their concerns to be addressed? The EU says the whole notion of ""mobility of citizens"" will be part of negotiations on the future relationship between the UK and the EU. But those talks have barely begun, and they won't be concluded by the time Brexit is due to take place in ten months' time. The fear is that ""mobility of citizens"" would then get caught up in haggling over all sorts of other issues in negotiations on a future free trade agreement. It wouldn't be a comfortable place to be. ""I don't feel like a bargaining chip, I am a bargaining chip, and I shouldn't be,"" says Fiona Godfrey. On behalf of British in Europe, she has this appeal for Theresa May: ""Write to the member states, write to (Michel) Barnier, and say we would like British citizens to have continuing free movement. ""We think it is a deal that can be done if she just makes the request.""The proposed 21-month transition (or implementation) period after Brexit gives everyone involved a bit of breathing space, but time to include a deal on future free movement in the Withdrawal Agreement is fast running out. So does the government think that is still a possibility? In a written statement, the Department for Exiting the European Union, said: ""We've reached a reciprocal deal for our citizens during the implementation period that recognises the valuable contribution that EU citizens make to the UK, and that UK citizens make to the EU.""The issue of onward movement rights for UK citizens in the EU has not been forgotten and we will raise this in the next phase of negotiations.""The UK will seek to reach a final deal that is in the mutual interest of citizens living across the continent.""But no-one knows when that final deal on the future relationship will be agreed. And the concern among many UK citizens in the EU is that they will have no certainty about their future status, and their ability to work as they do now, until after the UK has left.Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questionsFollow us on Twitter"

She has a death stare which makes Gordon Brown look, by comparison, like the kind of prime minister who'd be dead-legged by a nine-year-old in a school playground. But is she as tough as she looks? Or is Mrs May merely stubborn? And cautious? And rather indecisive?For a prime minister who has - or at least, once had - a reputation for strength, Theresa May's now spending a surprising amount of time being urged behind closed doors in Downing Street to stand up, and face down, the hard-line Brexiteers in her own party. A stream of Tory MPs have been urging Mrs May to defy the hard-line Brexiteers for the sake of striking compromises to achieve what they're calling a sensible Brexit. Three former Cabinet ministers were the latest through the door. Amber Rudd, Justine Greening and her former deputy Damian Green.Green told me, in an interview for BBC Radio 4's World at One: ""There's a danger of assuming that those who shout the loudest represent the most and I think there is a silent majority within the parliamentary party that wants Brexit, that accepts that Brexit is going to happen, but wants it to be a pragmatic and sensible Brexit that means, above all, there's no disruption if we can achieve that.""What, then, about the whispered threat among Brexiteers that Mrs May might face a vote of no confidence, if she strays too far from the Brexit straight and narrow? Was he sure she'd win?""Certainly that, but I think even before that, the vast majority of my colleagues, even those who have been very strongly campaigning for Brexit, recognise that this is absolutely not the time to do that sort of thing.""So what might a so-called sensible Brexit look like? While Cabinet ministers search for agreement on Britain's future customs relationship with the EU - a search which, I'm hearing, is getting nowhere fast - attention's focussing on getting Brussels to agree to the fall-back plan of extending a customs deal until new trade deals are struck, and ensuring British borders have the staff and high-tech equipment to cope.Meanwhile, at Westminster, there is more talk among Tory MPs than many people suppose about perhaps extending some form of single market relationship at the same time.The former head of Theresa May's Policy Board, ex-minister George Freeman, certainly thinks so. And look closely for a phrase which seems to have become fashionable.""The silent majority of the Conservative parliamentary party want the prime minister, and support the prime minister in negotiating a deal where we have as frictionless and as cost-free access to the European market as we can negotiate, and the freedom to do our own deals with the emerging economies,"" he told me.""The mood in the parliamentary party is that the balance of probability falls in terms of staying with our existing market, and the burden of proof falls with those emerging trade deals. If we see them and begin to see what they could be worth then the mood shifts. But right now the vast majority of Conservative MPs want to deliver a prosperity Brexit."" Maybe so, but getting even broad agreement among MPs would be tough.  Getting agreement in Brussels, maybe tougher still.And there's a view among senior Tories that it would take a parliamentary defeat at the hands of Tory rebels and Labour opponents to force Theresa May's hand. Or untie them, depending on your point of view.The Tory rebels' unofficial chief whip in the Commons is Stephen Hammond. Were the rebels who are threatening to vote to stay in the EU Customs Union holding firm? Ready to defeat the Government? The answer was ""yes... if forced"".""But we're a long way away from that. I am trying to work with the government, as a number of others are, to make sure that we can get what the prime minister wants, which is frictionless trade. We need to start concentrating on the interests of British industry. And therefore if in the short term, we need a longer period in the customs union to sort out our new customs arrangements, that's what the government should do,"" he said.Committed, convinced, Brexiteers insist enough compromises have already been made. Peter Bone doesn't shout. He's quite softly spoken. But still manages to make himself clear.""There have been lots and lots of compromises by people who believe in Brexit to keep everyone together,"" he said.""But there are certain things that we've compromised enough on to get agreement and we really can't go any further on those. We shouldn't be listening to people who shout the loudest, we should be talking to everyone and trying to create an agreement that everyone can support. But that has to be based on what the British people voted for.""To state the obvious, Brexit's a struggle. With Brussels. In the Tory party. And remember the wrangling in the Labour Party will be every bit as crucial to the outcome - whatever that may be.But just now, the silent majority in the Tory party, if that's what they are, are keen to give a new meaning to the Brexiteer's favourite slogan. The one about ""Taking back control""."
2018-06-01,Protectionist racket?,https://web.archive.org//web/20180602113014/https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44291103,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowWhen it comes to trade with the rest of the world, the European Union is sometimes accused of having high barriers and protecting its own producers.  It's an allegation that some supporters of Brexit have been making for some time.  The charge has had something of resurgence in the light of the renewed debate about exactly what sort of customs arrangement Britain should have with the European Union in the future. But does it stand up?The EU does certainly have barriers to trade, and they do, one way or another, raise the cost of imported goods. But every country on the planet has some sort of barriers. So how does the EU compare?Tariffs - taxes that are levied only on imported goods - are the most readily quantified and compared. For the most part, the EU's tariffs are relatively low. There are a number of ways of calculating an average. You can take a ""simple"" average, or you can weight the tariffs in line with the amount of trade that's affected. Both have drawbacks and advantages.Then you can look at ""bound"" tariffs, the amount that countries have pledged in the World Trade Organization that they won't exceed. Or you can look at applied tariffs, the amount they actually impose which can be lower, sometimes by a large margin. On any basis, the EU's average tariffs are fairly moderate but certainly not the lowest. The lowest figure for the EU is the trade-weighted figure for applied tariffs (the most recent in the WTO database is 2015). It was 3%. That's higher than the US (2.3%) and Japan (2.1%), but lower than Australia (4%) or Canada (but only just at 3.1%). Some developing countries have higher levels, such as 10.4% for Brazil.But the major developed economies can't match Hong Kong, which has no tariffs. If you drill down into particular sectors, then you get a more varied picture. Tariffs on farm produce tend to be higher, including in the EU. The trade-weighted average is 7.8%, and that is a good deal higher than the US figure of 3.8%. But if you want to sell agricultural goods into Switzerland there's an average tariff of nearly 30%. One complaint sometimes made against the EU by its British opponents is about tariffs on goods from developing countries, notably from Africa. Although there are some tariffs, most African nations benefit from an EU arrangement that allows almost completely tariff and quota free access for their goods. It's known as Everything but Arms. It applies to those nations (not just in Africa) classified as least developed.    Many others benefit from Economic Partnership Agreements or other arrangements that give extensive tariff-free access to the EU market. The EU also has free trade agreements which allow many other countries duty free access (though not necessarily for all goods). Among others that covers Canada, Chile and South Korea. Japan has such an agreement with the EU though it has not yet come into force. The big gap on that list is the US. Negotiations were launched in 2013 though they have stalled.  Nor does the EU have free trade agreements with the two largest developing economies, China or India. In the case of India talks have made slow progress, partly due to British reluctance to agree the more liberal visa regime sought by New Delhi. With China the EU is negotiating an investment agreement, but not a trade deal. There's more to trade barriers than tariffs, however. The other things that exporters have to contend with are known collectively as - surprisingly enough - non-tariff barriers (NTBs). They include product standards, health and safety regulations, and labelling requirements. In many service industries there are licensing requirements and restrictions on who is eligible for authorisation. Although suppliers may have to comply with such rules in their home market, if they want to sell into a country where the rules are different there is likely to be additional cost. More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:There are often good reasons for such barriers - such as protecting consumers - but they do have an impact on trade and they can be a form of disguised protection for national suppliers. One of the few analyses arguing that Brexit would be economically beneficial was based on the idea of the UK eliminating tariffs and also NTBs.Is the EU especially guilty in this area? NTBs are hard to quantify and compare, though some economists have tried.One analysis looked at measures to restrict trade that countries are required to report to the World Trade Organization. The EU came third behind the US and China for the number of measures notified. Looking at service industries, all barriers to trade are NTBs. There are no tariffs on services. In this sector the EU's single market is less complete than it is for goods, so research by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) looked at individual EU countries.  The report covered 22 service industries in 44 nations (rich countries and some of the more advanced emerging economies) 23 of them EU members. Eight of the 10 least restrictive were EU members. The EU also supports its farmers with subsidies. The system clearly helps them survive in the face of international competition. The OECD's estimate of total subsidies to farmers was close to $100bn in 2016. But the EU is a very large economy and if you look at how much of farmers' incomes come from subsidies the EU doesn't stand out so much. It's more generous to farmers than the US but less than Japan, South Korea, Norway, Iceland or Switzerland. The conclusion is that the EU does indeed protect some of its producers, especially farmers, from outside competition, although the EU's single market means they are fully exposed to competition from within the EU.  The EU can't claim to be the world's freest trader, but on many measures it's toward the more liberal end of the spectrum. Britain may be able to go even further in that direction and remove barriers to trade unilaterally. That will depend on what withdrawal agreement is reached with the EU and on a political judgement by the government about what changes to, for example, food standards it - and voters - are willing to accept.

2018-06-01,Arts outside the EU,https://web.archive.org//web/20180602113014/https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-44300562,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowFrom Adele to James Bond, from David Hockney to Harry Potter, the UK's creative talent is admired around the globe. And the creative industries are one of the UK's fastest growing sectors, growing at twice the rate of the overall economy.Those in the creative industries are far more anti-Brexit than the rest of the country - a poll by the Creative Industries Federation (CIF) found 96% of its members voted Remain in the 2016 referendum.Personal politics aside, there are practical reasons why people in the arts are worried that Brexit will be bad news - including their concerns about free movement of talent, funding and Britain's reputation around the world.But others are seeing silver linings.Here are some of the ways Brexit could affect the UK's creative industries and talent. Arctic Monkeys, Idles (pictured), Chvrches and Jorja Smith are just some of the 40 UK acts travelling to play at this weekend's Primavera Sound festival in Barcelona.As well as worries about the end of free movement having an impact on people wanting to live and work in another country, there are also concerns that it will make it more difficult for musicians and other performers to go on tour.They may need visas for themselves and their crew, and could need carnets - documents allowing the temporary movement of goods - for their instruments and equipment.There might also be complex tax procedures and lengthy customs checks. All that could be expensive and time-consuming to organise.Big-name acts will probably feel the effects less, but there are fears that it will be prohibitive for up-and-coming artists and larger ensembles.The same applies to European performers wanting to travel to the UK.Former Labour MP Michael Dugher, chief executive of trade body UK Music, has called on the government to bring in a ""touring passport"" to get around any extra red tape and cost.Britain's film and TV industries have been booming of late, thanks largely to Hollywood studios choosing the UK to film blockbusters like Solo: A Star Wars Story, Mission: Impossible - Fallout and Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom.Foreign studios spent £1.7bn in the UK in 2017 - almost double the amount spent four years previously. Most of that money came from America, encouraged by the fall in the value of the pound after the UK voted to leave the EU, which makes it more attractive for US studios to film in the UK. If, as Brexiteers hope, a wide-ranging free trade deal is struck with the US, the trend could well continue.Some film-makers are worried about being able to recruit crew members from Europe to work in the UK, though, and have voiced concerns about European co-productions, funding and distribution schemes.However, Lord Puttnam, who produced Chariots of Fire and is president of the Film Distributors' Association, has said more investment in home-grown films ""with a distinctive British voice could help to deliver a form of national re-branding"".If the UK had never been in the EU, children's favourite The Gruffalo - one of every child's favourite books - wouldn't have existed, its German-born illustrator Axel Scheffler recently said.He brought the character - and many others - to life, working with writer Julia Donaldson in what must be one of the most successful UK-EU creative partnerships.He moved to the UK 36 years ago and said that without free movement, he wouldn't have been able to make his home in Britain and team up with Donaldson.Scheffler is one of thousands of Europeans in creative jobs in the UK - the CIF estimated there were at least 130,000 EU nationals working in the sector in 2016.Some areas rely on European talent more than others. An estimated 30% of people working in visual effects for film and TV were from the EU, with the figure at 20-30% for video games and 25% for architecture.One of the biggest concerns about Brexit is that some of those people will want to - or be forced to - go home. It's also feared that others will be put off coming to the UK or be unable to do so, meaning artistic collaborations may not happen and some companies may struggle to attract the necessary talent.In December, a joint document issued by the UK government and the EU said both EU citizens and UK nationals will be able ""to live, work or study as they currently do under the same conditions as under Union law"" after Brexit.The late Martin Roth, the German museum director who took London's V&A to new heights, said upon his departure in September 2016 that he might not have taken the post if it had come up after the EU referendum.""I'd probably still be offered a job, but the question is rather, would that job still be as attractive in such a context?"" he said.UK media watchdog Ofcom currently regulates around 1,200 TV services. But almost a third of those do not broadcast to UK viewers.They are based in the UK - but the current ""country of origin"" rule says media outlets can serve the whole of the EU as long as they abide by the rules of their host country. Some of these companies are considering relocating if they can no longer reach the whole of the EU from the UK, while others have put plans for new investment in the UK on hold, Ofcom said last year.The Guardian has reported that Discovery is planning to move its European playout hub from London.English arts organisations received £345m from the EU between 2007 and 2016, according to Arts Council England (ACE).However, an ACE report said only 14% of its organisations have direct EU funding, with 30% of the organisations saying they have benefitted indirectly from EU funding.Those getting funding include the Hall for Cornwall in Truro, which has £2.1m European Regional Development Funding to help pay for a new creative industries workspace unit.In August 2016, the government said it would guarantee to support some EU-funded projects after the UK leaves the EU.Amid all the speculation about what might happen after Brexit, there is one concrete consequence we do know about.In November, the European Commission cancelled the UK's turn to host the European Capital of Culture in 2023 - because the UK will have left the EU by then.Dundee, Nottingham, Leeds, Milton Keynes and Belfast/Derry had their eyes on the boost to their economies and images that the title would have brought.When Liverpool was the UK's last Capital of Culture in 2008, it saw an extra 9.7 million visits and a £750m injection into the local economy.When ACE published a survey of its members' views on Brexit in February, one of the key concerns was that the vote would harm the UK's global standing.""There are significant concerns about the potential negative impact of Brexit on the UK's international reputation for arts and culture,"" its report said.One of the organisations quoted, Newcastle-based Isis Arts, works with many European partners.""People are not looking to us in quite the same way that they might have done before,"" they said. ""Our position over there in these other countries is slipping away from us. It's such a shame because we were held in very high regard.""But the CIF points out that there are opportunities for British firms and talent beyond the EU.It talks about catering for ""the expanding middle class in nations from Chile to China"", especially through new digital technologies.Architects' body RIBA says the UK can fill a skills shortage in the US, while institutions like the V&A and the British Museum have been making inroads in Asia and the Middle East.The CIF quotes Diane Banks of Diane Banks Associates Literary & Talent Agency as saying: ""Investors are much more interested in our access to North American and Asian markets than the EU as these markets offer the highest growth potential, particularly when dealing with an English-language product.""Leaving the EU will also present exciting opportunities to innovate and be more competitive.""Michael Lightfoot, who started the group Artists For Brexit, says: ""We are very keen on trying to promote the notion of global Britain.

Here are some of those that went before her.The Green Party effectively began life after a Coventry couple got a group of friends together to discuss a Playboy article on rainforest destruction.Out of that 1973 meeting a small party called People was born which fielded just five candidates in the February 1974 general election.The following year People became the Ecology Party and adopted the ""Manifesto for a Sustainable Society"".The document would eventually become the ""philosophical and policy"" blueprint for the Green Party which came into being in 1985. The Scottish Green Party became a separate party in 1990, hence the party we are referring to here is the Green Party of England and Wales. The party prided itself on taking a different, non-hierarchical approach to politics and initially did not have a leader, electing two principal speakers - a male and a female - instead. They ditched that system in 2008, with the aim of generating more media coverage, but the move was not popular with everyone in the party.The Greens' first solo leader was Caroline Lucas. A member of the European Parliament since 1999, she was an accomplished media performer who believed giving the party a single, recognisable face would help draw attention to its policies.She succeeded in gaining the party a long-coveted toe-hold at Westminster, when she was elected MP for Brighton Pavilion in 2010 by a margin of 1,252. She won 31.3% of the votes on a turnout of 70%. But two years later she announced she was standing down as leader, to allow others in the party to build up their profile. The previously little-known Australian journalist replaced Caroline Lucas as party leader in 2012, winning 42.2% of the votes in the party's leadership election. She won overwhelmingly again in 2014.She had previously stood - unsuccessfully - for the Greens in the 2006 and 2010 Camden Council elections and stood for the Parliamentary seat of Holborn and St Pancras in 2010. She came fourth with 2.7% of the vote.Ms Bennett targeted disaffected Labour voters with an anti-austerity message and succeeded in doubling the party's share of the vote at the 2015 general election, gaining prime time exposure in televised debates. She also led the party during the EU referendum campaign, backing the Remain side.But as someone new to frontline politics she sometimes struggled with media appearances, famously suffering what she described as ""brain fade"" while trying to explain the party's housing policy in a live radio interview.In a bit of a return to the early days of having two people sharing the leadership role, Caroline Lucas and Jonathan Bartley stood on a joint ticket and won 86% of the vote in the 2016 Green leadership election, on a turnout of 29.8%.Bartley, like Natalie Bennett a relative newcomer to Green politics, had previously been a think tank director and a leading voice in the ill-fated campaign to change Britain's voting system in the 2011 AV referendum.He did not stand for election at the 2017 general election. He had previously stood unsuccessfully for the Green candidacy at the 2016 London mayoral election, and for the London constituency of Streatham in the 2015 general election. He finally gained elected office in May this year, when he became a councillor in Lambeth, South London, and is now leader of the official opposition to Labour there. At the 2017 general election. Lucas and Bartley enthusiastically embraced the idea of a ""progressive alliance"" of left-leaning parties joining forces to fight the Conservatives. But some in the party were unhappy at being asked to stand aside for Labour or Lib Dem candidates and the party saw its share of the vote more than halve from 2015, with just 1.5% of votes cast. One bright spot was that Caroline Lucas successfully defended her Brighton seat.Prior to 2008 the party had two principal speakers rather than a leader. Here are some of those who held the role:A seasoned activist and campaigner, Sian Berry has been a member of the London Assembly since 2016 and a member of Camden council since 2014, increasing her majority in the Hampstead and Highgate ward earlier this month.She came fourth in the 2008 London mayoral elections and went one better in 2016, overtaking the Liberal Democrats to come third.She was one of the Green Party's principal speakers from 2006 to 2007 and was a founder of the Alliance against Urban 4x4s and a supporter of the Reheat Britain scheme that secured a boiler scrappage scheme in 2009.An economics lecturer with a long history of Green activism, having joined the Ecology Party in 1980, Derek Wall is a leading figure in the ""eco-socialist"" wing of the party, sometimes referred to as Red Greens, for their anti-capitalist views.At the 2005 general election, he stood unsuccessfully as a candidate for Windsor, coming fourth with 2.5% of the vote.He was the Green Party's last male principal speaker, from 2006 to 2007 (alongside Sian Berry) and from 2007 to 2008 (alongside Caroline Lucas). He campaigned against the proposed single leader system, describing the title of leader as ""embarrassing"" and ""patronising"", and comparing a party with a leader to a flock of sheep with a shepherd. He stood against Theresa May in Maidenhead in last year's general election, gaining 2% of the vote.Having joined what was then the Ecology Party in 1977, Jean Lambert became female principal speaker from 1992 to 1993, alongside Richard Lawson, followed by Mallen Baker, and again from 1998 to 1999, alongside Mike Woodin.The former teacher from Walthamstow, East London, was - alongside Caroline Lucas - the first Green politician to win a seat in the European Parliament in 1999. She won 87,545 votes (7.7 %) and was re-elected in 2004 and again in 2014. She served as vice president of the Greens/European Free Alliance Group of MEPs.An influential figure in the early years of the party, who sought to combine what he described in a 1998 article as ""my two personal worlds - of Ecology Party meetings and actions on the one hand, and of a cultural 'hippy revolution' on the other"", he advocated non-violent direct action and a decentralised party structure.In the 1980s, he founded the Green Gatherings festival and the Greenfields area at Glastonbury festival, coordinating litter picking operations.He was the party's male principal speaker from 1994 to 1995 alongside Jan Clark, and from 1995 and 1997 alongside Peg Alexander.Keith Taylor was a key figure in building up the Green Party's Brighton powerbase, first as a councillor and then as a Parliamentary candidate.He gained 9.3% of the vote in the 2001 general election and then 21.9% in 2005, missing out on a seat at Westminster.After being elected male principal speaker in 2005, narrowly beating Derek Wall, he revealed he had been banned from every Tesco store in the country after staging demonstrations against the building of a new supermarket in Bristol in the early 1990s.He served alongside Caroline Lucas in the principal speaker role for a year, before being defeated by Mr Wall by 767 votes to 705.But he was able to take up a seat in the European Parliament, when Ms Lucas became an MP in 2010. He was re-elected as an MEP for the South-East of England in 2014."
2018-06-01,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20180602113014/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks  have now moved on to future relations - after agreement was reached on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are just beginning. Both sides hope they can agree within six months on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all.  Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide, but first let's go back to the basics...It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro.Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.5%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand near a 40-year year low of 4.3%. Annual house price increases have fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 4.9% in the year to January 2018, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May is seeking to put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. If passed, it will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, is supposed to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said continued membership of the single market has to be an option in negotiations with Brussels.   Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The single market is a very different beast - it is not just about the trade in goods. It allows the free movement of people, money and services as if the EU was a single country.Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each playing roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border check for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanAn agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement.The full details are not yet known but UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72.We don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pounds buy fewer euros. A slump in the value of the dollar means the exchange rate with the pound is pretty close to where it was before the referendum.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.A method for calculating the bill has been agreed, but the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more.The question of how and when payments will be made still needs to resolved, but it will be a schedule lasting for many years to come, and it is highly unlikely that anyone will ever be able to give an exact figure for the size of the divorce bill.UK sources say it will be up to £40bn, but some EU sources expect it to be higher than that. No-one can say for sure, and both sides want to keep it that way.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 6.5% in 2016 to 2.7% in 2017, according to the Halifax. It said the slowdown was driven by a squeeze on real wage growth.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-06-01,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180602113014/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to £840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

Read more from LauraJohn Curtice, Professor of Politics at the University of StrathclydeThis is the third post-war snap election called unexpectedly before a party's term of office had come to an end.  On the two previous occasions in 1970 and February 1974 the PM and the party lost office. While there is no other conceivable administration in the new parliament other than a Conservative-led one, it remains to be seen whether the PM will retain her position. However, so long as the Conservatives can reach an accommodation with the DUP they will have a working majority in the House of Commons.  BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed:When the general election exit poll was revealed at 10pm, the pound immediately dropped by 2% as investors took a position that a hung parliament was a possible outcome of the general election.Why would that cause the currency to decline? Because a hung parliament means that the government's direction of travel would be less certain.

Gwent Police believed Andrew Newton - who claimed he was paid to kill Mr Scott - had died. But the force has now told the BBC this may not be the case.Mr Scott said he thought police were continuing a ""cover-up"". The revelations have been made in the BBC Four documentary The Jeremy Thorpe Scandal. Following the BBC's revelations, the Mail on Sunday said it had tracked down Mr Newton - living under a different name - in Surrey. The paper has published what it claims is a picture of Mr Newton, taken on Saturday. The man's face cannot be seen.Mr Thorpe, who died in 2014, was accused of hiring a hitman to murder Mr Scott but was acquitted at an Old Bailey trial in 1979.The fresh investigation was launched by Gwent Police in 2015 after new claims emerged. But the police's belief that Newton - who was convicted of shooting Mr Scott's dog in 1975 - had died, led the Crown Prosecution Service to close it last year.Gwent Police told documentary makers enquiries made as part of the investigation had ""indicated Newton was deceased"".  But they added: ""We have now revisited these enquiries and have identified information which indicates that Newton may still be alive.""The force said it planned to assess if Mr Newton ""is able to assist the investigation"".When asked on Saturday night about the Mail on Sunday's claims to have tracked Mr Newton to Surrey, Gwent Police said it had ""lines of inquiry open"" but would not provide further comment ""at this time"".BBC Panorama journalist Tom Mangold, who has investigated the case since the 1970s, said the 2015 investigation hinged on the story of a man he had met called Dennis Meighan.Mr Meighan told the veteran reporter he was originally approached to carry out the murder - but he claims his police statement was later doctored to remove incriminating references to the Liberal Party and to Mr Thorpe.Following Gwent Police's admission that Newton could still be alive, Mr Mangold insisted the investigation ""must start again"".And reacting to the news, Mr Scott, 78, told the documentary: ""I just don't think anyone's tried hard enough to look for him. I really don't. ""There must be people who knew him and there would surely be a record of him dying.""I thought [Gwent Police] were doing something at last, and soon found out that absolutely they weren't, they were continuing the cover up as far as I can see.""The programme includes unearthed footage from a Panorama programme from 1979 that was never broadcast for legal reasons, after Mr Thorpe and his three co-defendants were acquitted of conspiracy to murder.The director general at the time kept a master copy of the programme but ordered all other copies to be destroyed. But journalist Tom Mangold kept his copy of the report.The programme will air after the end of the dramatisation A Very British Scandal, which stars Hugh Grant as Jeremy Thorpe and Ben Whishaw as Norman Scott.The Jeremy Thorpe Scandal will be broadcast on Sunday at 22:00 BST."

On Friday, Mrs May said she was ""disappointed"" at the US decision - which will see a 25% duty on European steel and a 10% duty on European aluminium - and that the taxes were ""unjustified"".  Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Dr Fox said the UK was still seeking exemptions from the tariffs.""We will still be making that case throughout this week,"" he said. He added: ""The United States believes, I believe wrongly and illegally, that this is a national security matter for the US.""Given that we export some pretty complex steel products to the United States which are part of their national security programmes themselves, this reasoning that is given is wrong and therefore we believe unlawful.""President Trump originally imposed the tariffs in March, claiming that if the US remained reliant on imported metals, it would threaten the country's national security and damage its own metal industry.The tariffs apply to a wide range of steel and aluminium products such as sheets, plates, bars, pipes and ""semi-finished"" products.President Trump initially exempted Canada, Mexico and the EU from the tariffs to allow time for negotiations. However, the exemption ended at midnight on Thursday, meaning the new taxes would be collected from Friday. According to UK Steel - the body which represents steel producers across the country - 7% of steel exports go to the US, worth £360m.About 31,000 people across the UK work in steel production and many more in the supply chain, with steel mills in the North East, East Midlands, Yorkshire, and Wales.The head of UK Steel, Gareth Stace, said EU leaders had a ""gun held to their head"" and while he admitted that there was a problem of global over-capacity in the industry, he claimed most of that was in China.He said that about 20 million tonnes of Chinese steel would need to ""find a new home to go to"" because of the tariffs.""Because we are a free and open market here in the UK/the EU, it'll come here, we believe, and therefore further damage our sector - not only from the direct impact of tariffs in the US but the surge of steel coming here,"" he added. UK exports of aluminium to the US are small, but the UK's Aluminium Federation said it was concerned about the impact the tariffs could have, hindering free trade.Dr Fox travelled to Washington in March to seek a further exemption for the UK, as there are concerns it could impact the UK market by increasing its prices, but he was unsuccessful. Earlier this week, he called the tariff proposals ""disappointing"" and ""absurd"".Dr Fox's comments follow those of EU trade commissioner, Cecilia Malmstrom, who also called the new tariffs illegal and said the US was playing a ""dangerous game"". French President Emmanuel Macron backed the position, telling President Trump the duties were illegal over the telephone. But Dr Fox warned against a ""tit-for-tat"" escalation in the light of EU counter measures, adding: ""There can be no victors in a trade war, only casualties.""   The EU has drawn up a target list of 100 US goods worth €2.8bn ($3.5bn, £2.5bn) for its retaliatory tariffs, the BBC understands.The 10-page list includes Harley Davidson motorcycles, bourbon, Florida orange juice, cosmetics and jeans.If the list is implemented, it could lead to many every day items becoming more expensive for shoppers in the UK, as shops pass on increased import prices."

We await written proposals from the British side.""In February, the EU proposed a backstop which would involve the UK, in respect of Northern Ireland, maintaining full alignment with those rules of the EU's single market and customs union which support north-south cooperation.Prime Minister Theresa May said she could never agree to that as it would ""threaten the constitutional integrity of the UK by creating a customs and regulatory border down the Irish Sea""."

If the authorities don't see that they have had a serious failure of common sense and compassion.""Mr Flack has written to European Parliament President Antonio Tajani, and Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov to stop what he calls ""a travesty of justice"".A petition has also been raised by the Daily Telegraph to save the beleaguered bovine on compassionate grounds."

""It was the French authorities who told me that I should apply for a carte de sejour. Nothing else has changed.""A carte de sejour shows a person is legally resident in France and it is hoped possession of such documentation will help avoid complications after Brexit.In his interview with Connexion, an English-language French magazine for expats, Lord Lawson said he believes the issue of Britons living in other EU countries will be sorted out in Brexit talks but that trade was a ""problem"", along with the Irish border issue.""I think the issue could be no trade deal. There will be agreement on expats and security,"" he said.""It's not helped by the fact the current government is weak and is not doing a particularly good job. But that's a fact of life.""I think the most likely outcome is initially no trade deal, then after Britain is fully out of the EU and passions have cooled there will be agreement at a future date.""Asked if he had applied for  a carte de sejour, Lord Lawson said: ""Yes I've just started, and don't know how it will work out, but am not particularly worried. ""It comes under the category of 'tiresome' rather than 'serious'. I understand some people are worried about healthcare cover and hope it will be sorted out. ""Speaking as a Brit in France - and I'm not applying for French nationality - I am not worried.""Lord Lawson said said Brexit would provide benefits to Britain but it depended on the policies of the government of the day.""There are things we'd like to do that we can't now because we don't have the autonomy.

It follows a warning by the mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, that an ""emergency"" timetable was being considered to deal with the scale of train cancellations and delays.Mr Burnham said the introduction of an emergency timetable was ""unacceptable"".""The travelling public are having their lives turned upside down."" Northern managing director David Brown said: ""We have been experiencing some significant disruption to train services, especially around north Manchester, Bolton, Liverpool, Blackpool and up to the Lake District.""He apologised for the ""unacceptable situation"" and ""unacceptable service many customers have been subject to"".Mr Brown added: ""We are absolutely committed to resolving the service issues and the interim plan will help ensure we start to get back on track and start to give customers more certainty around the services we operate.""The Transport Secretary Chris Grayling cited government-owned Network Rail - which manages the rail infrastructure - for the problems.He said it was ""too late in finalising planned timetable changes"" which have caused widespread problems since they were introduced.The RMT's general secretary Mick Cash said the minister should ""get out"" and described the situation as ""carnage"".Mr Cash said his members are facing public anger ""without a shred of support"" from Mr Grayling or Northern's management.He said it was ""disgusting"" that Mr Grayling and bosses of rail companies have ""dived for cover"" and not faced passengers.""Not only is Chris Grayling incompetent and not fit to run a railway but he is a coward as well, leaving RMT members to take the flack for failed policies that are his responsibility,"" he said.In response, the transport secretary issued a statement which said: ""I am in regular discussions with Network Rail, Northern and Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR), and have reiterated that disruption suffered by passengers is wholly unacceptable.""I have been very clear with Network Rail that it was far too late in finalising planned timetable changes and this must not happen again.""Train companies are working to keep passengers moving and disruption minimised. ""While this is currently a huge inconvenience to passengers as the changes bed in, we are investing in the biggest modernisation of the railway since Victorian times and this new timetable will deliver hundreds more services up and down the country.""Earlier this week, Mr Grayling wrote to MPs over the ""wholly unsatisfactory"" service on GTR in the south of England and Northern.He also criticised Network Rail, saying it ""cannot cope"" with the workload, and its performance was ""simply unacceptable"".Wigan MP Lisa Nandy said Mr Grayling would meet with MPs on Monday when the Transport Select Committee will review the Northern and GTR franchises.Last month's timetable update included many more changes than normal in an attempt to improve punctuality and account for extra services and capacity following billions of pounds of investment.The timing of all GTR and most Northern trains was changed, but all the new journeys needed to be individually approved by Network Rail, which is responsible for managing infrastructure.Are you a Northern passenger?

Mr Farage, one of the most polarising figures in British politics, has become a well-known figure in the US due to regular appearances on Fox News and his outspoken support for President Donald Trump.Now it appears that the MEP is trying to break new ground down under, with a week of shows in Perth, Brisbane, Adelaide, Sydney and Melbourne.He will also be visiting New Zealand for a show in Auckland.

The Labour leader's office then sent a reminder to Labour MPs of the party's commitment to ban unpaid internships.Mr Umunna, who has criticised Mr Corbyn in the past and who is opposed to the party's policy on Brexit, has campaigned for fairer wages for the low paid.The ad, for a year in industry student placement, which was circulated to students at Leeds University, listed duties such as ""administrative support"", organising ""a wide variety of policy issues and constituent enquiries"" and ""EU campaign work"".It said the placement was unpaid but the cost of a student travel card - worth about £1,000 a year - will be covered.Hi @KaneEmerson.

In line with the formal two-year timetable for the Brexit talks, the UK and the EU are planning on reaching a deal in the autumn, which will then be voted on by MPs in parliament.An open letter, co-ordinated by anti-Brexit campaign group Wales For Europe and signed by 31 senior Welsh politicians, urges ""everyone in Wales of goodwill, from all parties and none, to stand with us in calling on our MPs to pledge their support for a people's vote on the final Brexit deal.""The letter said: ""Will it be the right deal for the people of Wales and the rest of the UK? Will it secure a good future for our young people and allow them to thrive? Will it help protect and grow the number of well-paid, highly-skilled, jobs that Wales needs?""It is signed by eight council leaders, two of Wales' four MEPs, and 12 of the 40 Welsh MPs, including Owen Smith who was fired as shadow Northern Ireland secretary by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn for calling for another EU referendum against party policy.Welsh Labour MPs Anna McMorrin and Tonia Antoniazzi have signed the letter despite being shadow parliamentary private secretaries who are expected to follow the party's line. Nine AMs have also put their name to the letter, including Plaid Cymru Leader Leanne Wood, Labour Welsh Government Local Government Secretary Alun Davies and Education Secretary Kirsty Williams, a Liberal Democrat.Mr Smith told BBC Good Morning Wales that people now have a ""deeper understanding"" of what Brexit means and he feels confident they may change their votes once they see the final deal. ""We've been discussing [Brexit] for the last almost three years,"" he said. ""I think there is now a very deep understanding in the public's mind as to what the trade-offs are, what the compromises are, and what some of the downsides are.""Now the people are better informed, now that the complexity is more revealed, we can have a more complete view from the country and in my view, I think you might well see people change their mind.""Mr Davies accused the UK government of being in chaos and said he had no trust in its ""ability to bring back a deal that will meet the needs of the people of Wales"".""That means the people of Wales have to have the opportunity to vote on what the UK government does bring back,"" he said.He said that he would hope to hold the second referendum before March next year, which is the point when Article 50 ends and the UK is set to leave the EU. ""It was poised on a knife edge, that vote, and in many parts of the country, people didn't vote for it,"" he added. ""It was an instruction to start the negotiations, but I don't think it was necessarily an instruction to the politicians on what the absolute outcome ought to be. ""All of those things that we were promised have turned out to be empty promises and the downsides have now been revealed.""I think in light of that, the sensible thing is to allow the people of Wales the chance to say whether they actually want to go through with this.""First Minister Carwyn Jones has consistently said that he does not want to re-run the referendum campaign and that Wales and the UK should respect the will of the public vote.Asked to clarify the Welsh Government's position on a second vote, a spokeswoman said: ""The First Minister's priority remains securing the best deal possible for the people of Wales and the UK.""The Labour MP for Aberavon, Stephen Kinnock, was asked to sign up to the letter but refused.Mr Kinnock added: ""I've been campaigning for an EEA-based Brexit solidly for over 18 months. If I were to now start supporting a campaign that's designed to reverse Brexit before 29 March then the credibility of my EEA arguments would be fatally undermined.""By arguing to reverse Brexit I would effectively be forfeiting my right to have a voice in shaping it.""Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies said the first minister had lost all authority after announcing plans to stand down later this year, and ministers were now ""freewheeling and publicly advocating positions which are against official Welsh Government policy"".""Jeremy Corbyn sacked Owen Smith for far less - and there are now serious questions over Carwyn Jones's ability to lead his party and his government as we enter a key period in the Brexit negotiations,"" Mr Davies added.  In a recent lecture for the campaign group 'Wales For Europe', the Welsh Government's lead on Brexit Mark Drakeford said a referendum ""is only one way in which the acceptability or otherwise of such a final deal could be tested"".But he added that ""now is not the moment to be over-definitive about the nature of the question that we would pose at such a point nor the way in which that question would be resolved""."

The joint committee welcomed the government's approach to fix the problems in the Act but raised concerns about ""related areas of discrimination in British nationality law"" - including the status of people whose parents were not married - or where the father was not a BOT citizen.The joint committee said that the UK Parliament could legislate for BOT citizenship rules and it was ""difficult to see"" why they had not been amended in the British Nationality Act, alongside the rules for other British citizens.""Such discrimination should not be allowed to persist,"" the report said.""We consider it unacceptable that discrimination in acquiring British nationality persists (including for British Overseas Territories citizenship) depending on whether a person's father or mother was a British Overseas Territories citizen, or whether or not their parents were married.""This type of discrimination in the British Nationality Act should be remedied for all types of British nationality and we recommend that the home secretary take urgent steps to bring forward legislation to do so.""  One campaigner told the committee: ""The matter is pretty straightforward to most sensible people, and in today's modern forward-thinking society, this matter should have been rectified a long time ago. ""Children now adults should never be made to feel they are 'less-than' under the law, especially when it comes to claiming the parents' heritage and citizenship by descent."" Immigration Minister Caroline Noakes told the committee: ""Any amendments to persons entitled to be registered as British Overseas Territory citizens will require consultation with the Overseas Territories and this is now on our agenda.

2018-06-02,Barclays tightens lending on Brexit caution,https://web.archive.org//web/20180603063706/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-44323693,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowBarclays is tightening its lending criteria to a UK economy that is lagging behind the rest of the world.Chief executive Jes Staley says Brexit uncertainty was helping to stunt economic growth and that was something the bank could not ignore.Speaking exclusively to the BBC he said ""we have to be mindful of weaknesses in the economy and we have protect the integrity of the bank"".That meant tightening some lending criteria, ""just to be prudent"".""In no way do we pull back in a radical fashion - but we will look at our credit exposures and see whether that's proper given the direction of the economy,"" Mr Staley said.""We can at the margin tighten some of our underwriting criteria and credit standards just to be prudent for the stability of the bank.""The UK economy is still growing - but very slowly. In the last 12 months it has grown 1.2% compared with 2.2% in the US and 2.5% in the eurozone.Mr Staley said measures might include looking at how big a loan Barclays would be prepared to provide as a percentage of the value of a residential property - the so called loan to value ratio - particularly in London and the South East. He arrived in north east England today with an encouraging message for local business - announcing a new £500m fund for loans to small and medium sized businesses. But his warning on the UK economy, and Barclays' risk appetite, was the more telling content for a bank with over a £1 trillion in UK loans.  The government has always accepted that businesses - particularly foreign ones - will be cautious about investing in the UK while Brexit is under discussion. A group of European industrialists told the Prime Minister as much at a meeting yesterday at Number 10 on Wednesday. But the fact that the headwinds are making a UK bank such as Barclays say explicitly that it is becoming concerned about its exposure to the UK economy is a new development."

""We've been left in limbo,"" says Fiona Godfrey, a freelance legal consultant living with her family in Luxembourg who also volunteers with the pressure group British in Europe. ""I think it's shameful. We should never ever have been put in this position."" The dilemma is that what has been agreed so far between the UK government and the EU - in the Withdrawal Agreement they are negotiating - will only give British citizens the right to live and work in the country where they reside. In Fiona's case, that means tiny Luxembourg. But at the moment she works in other countries every week, relying on her rights of freedom of movement within the EU single market. ""In 20 years I've worked in every EU member state, plus Norway and Switzerland,"" she says. ""We want to keep the rights we have - we need to keep our free movement, we need to keep our rights to work, and we need to keep recognition of our professional qualifications, because that is another huge issue.""Some UK citizens in the EU will be able to continue to work as they do now. If, for example, you are defined as a frontier worker - crossing a border on a regular basis for a nine-to-five job on a regular employment contract - then you should be OK. But if you are defined as a cross-border supplier of services there is no guarantee as yet that you'll be able to work after Brexit as you do now.  New restrictions could apply to all sorts of people:  lawyers, architects, truckers… or freelance chefs cooking for hungry skiers in the French Alps.""It's been very stressful. Nearly two years now, and we still have no clarity on what is going to happen and how we are going to be affected,"" says Helen Malaburn, speaking from her home near Les Trois Vallees in France. She and her husband have lived there for 10 years, cooking for tourists and local residents during the winter ski season. But in the summer, the work dries up, and they spend their time working in places like Greece and Spain. ""At the moment, we do approximately half of our work outside France,"" Helen says. ""There's no way we could sustain ourselves on the winter work that we do.""""We're completely dependent on being able to work across the EU, and having our qualifications (as chefs) recognised in every country, like they are now."" Helen and Fiona are not alone. The debate about UK citizens living in the EU often focuses on pensioners seeking warmer weather - and they certainly have concerns of their own. But roughly 80% of the one million or so Brits in the EU are of working age or younger.There is a lack of clarity on a number of other issues that concern them. It is still not clear, for example, whether UK citizens in the EU will have access to university education on the same financial terms as they do now; nor whether - as part of a bureaucratic process - they will have to make new applications to remain in the countries where they live. One solution to the dilemma facing so many people is to apply for dual citizenship. Both Helen and Fiona are in the process of doing so, as are many of their British counterparts. But it's not an option available in every country - Austria and the Netherlands, for example, don't allow it and other countries have some restrictions. Nor is there a guarantee of success, and the application process takes time. And that is the one thing that is now in short supply. The European Parliament has promised to take a tough line on protecting citizens' rights, and the Dutch MEP Sophie in 't Veld is critical of both sides in the Brexit negotiations.  ""They're making it into a legalistic issue,"" she says, ""but this is about the fundamental rights of people who have set up their lives here in Europe and are counting on free movement.""So this is a condition for the European Parliament to give its consent to the Withdrawal Agreement.""Does she think the European Parliament would otherwise struggle to approve the agreement (which it has to do before Brexit happens)? ""Yes. We have adopted a series of resolutions where we set out our conditions for giving consent, and this is one of them.""So when can UK citizens expect their concerns to be addressed? The EU says the whole notion of ""mobility of citizens"" will be part of negotiations on the future relationship between the UK and the EU. But those talks have barely begun, and they won't be concluded by the time Brexit is due to take place in ten months' time. The fear is that ""mobility of citizens"" would then get caught up in haggling over all sorts of other issues in negotiations on a future free trade agreement. It wouldn't be a comfortable place to be. ""I don't feel like a bargaining chip, I am a bargaining chip, and I shouldn't be,"" says Fiona Godfrey. On behalf of British in Europe, she has this appeal for Theresa May: ""Write to the member states, write to (Michel) Barnier, and say we would like British citizens to have continuing free movement. ""We think it is a deal that can be done if she just makes the request.""The proposed 21-month transition (or implementation) period after Brexit gives everyone involved a bit of breathing space, but time to include a deal on future free movement in the Withdrawal Agreement is fast running out. So does the government think that is still a possibility? In a written statement, the Department for Exiting the European Union, said: ""We've reached a reciprocal deal for our citizens during the implementation period that recognises the valuable contribution that EU citizens make to the UK, and that UK citizens make to the EU.""The issue of onward movement rights for UK citizens in the EU has not been forgotten and we will raise this in the next phase of negotiations.""The UK will seek to reach a final deal that is in the mutual interest of citizens living across the continent.""But no-one knows when that final deal on the future relationship will be agreed. And the concern among many UK citizens in the EU is that they will have no certainty about their future status, and their ability to work as they do now, until after the UK has left.Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questionsFollow us on Twitter"

She has a death stare which makes Gordon Brown look, by comparison, like the kind of prime minister who'd be dead-legged by a nine-year-old in a school playground. But is she as tough as she looks? Or is Mrs May merely stubborn? And cautious? And rather indecisive?For a prime minister who has - or at least, once had - a reputation for strength, Theresa May's now spending a surprising amount of time being urged behind closed doors in Downing Street to stand up, and face down, the hard-line Brexiteers in her own party. A stream of Tory MPs have been urging Mrs May to defy the hard-line Brexiteers for the sake of striking compromises to achieve what they're calling a sensible Brexit. Three former Cabinet ministers were the latest through the door. Amber Rudd, Justine Greening and her former deputy Damian Green.Green told me, in an interview for BBC Radio 4's World at One: ""There's a danger of assuming that those who shout the loudest represent the most and I think there is a silent majority within the parliamentary party that wants Brexit, that accepts that Brexit is going to happen, but wants it to be a pragmatic and sensible Brexit that means, above all, there's no disruption if we can achieve that.""What, then, about the whispered threat among Brexiteers that Mrs May might face a vote of no confidence, if she strays too far from the Brexit straight and narrow? Was he sure she'd win?""Certainly that, but I think even before that, the vast majority of my colleagues, even those who have been very strongly campaigning for Brexit, recognise that this is absolutely not the time to do that sort of thing.""So what might a so-called sensible Brexit look like? While Cabinet ministers search for agreement on Britain's future customs relationship with the EU - a search which, I'm hearing, is getting nowhere fast - attention's focussing on getting Brussels to agree to the fall-back plan of extending a customs deal until new trade deals are struck, and ensuring British borders have the staff and high-tech equipment to cope.Meanwhile, at Westminster, there is more talk among Tory MPs than many people suppose about perhaps extending some form of single market relationship at the same time.The former head of Theresa May's Policy Board, ex-minister George Freeman, certainly thinks so. And look closely for a phrase which seems to have become fashionable.""The silent majority of the Conservative parliamentary party want the prime minister, and support the prime minister in negotiating a deal where we have as frictionless and as cost-free access to the European market as we can negotiate, and the freedom to do our own deals with the emerging economies,"" he told me.""The mood in the parliamentary party is that the balance of probability falls in terms of staying with our existing market, and the burden of proof falls with those emerging trade deals. If we see them and begin to see what they could be worth then the mood shifts. But right now the vast majority of Conservative MPs want to deliver a prosperity Brexit."" Maybe so, but getting even broad agreement among MPs would be tough.  Getting agreement in Brussels, maybe tougher still.And there's a view among senior Tories that it would take a parliamentary defeat at the hands of Tory rebels and Labour opponents to force Theresa May's hand. Or untie them, depending on your point of view.The Tory rebels' unofficial chief whip in the Commons is Stephen Hammond. Were the rebels who are threatening to vote to stay in the EU Customs Union holding firm? Ready to defeat the Government? The answer was ""yes... if forced"".""But we're a long way away from that. I am trying to work with the government, as a number of others are, to make sure that we can get what the prime minister wants, which is frictionless trade. We need to start concentrating on the interests of British industry. And therefore if in the short term, we need a longer period in the customs union to sort out our new customs arrangements, that's what the government should do,"" he said.Committed, convinced, Brexiteers insist enough compromises have already been made. Peter Bone doesn't shout. He's quite softly spoken. But still manages to make himself clear.""There have been lots and lots of compromises by people who believe in Brexit to keep everyone together,"" he said.""But there are certain things that we've compromised enough on to get agreement and we really can't go any further on those. We shouldn't be listening to people who shout the loudest, we should be talking to everyone and trying to create an agreement that everyone can support. But that has to be based on what the British people voted for.""To state the obvious, Brexit's a struggle. With Brussels. In the Tory party. And remember the wrangling in the Labour Party will be every bit as crucial to the outcome - whatever that may be.But just now, the silent majority in the Tory party, if that's what they are, are keen to give a new meaning to the Brexiteer's favourite slogan. The one about ""Taking back control""."
2018-06-02,Protectionist racket?,https://web.archive.org//web/20180603063706/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-44291103,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowWhen it comes to trade with the rest of the world, the European Union is sometimes accused of having high barriers and protecting its own producers.  It's an allegation that some supporters of Brexit have been making for some time.  The charge has had something of resurgence in the light of the renewed debate about exactly what sort of customs arrangement Britain should have with the European Union in the future. But does it stand up?The EU does certainly have barriers to trade, and they do, one way or another, raise the cost of imported goods. But every country on the planet has some sort of barriers. So how does the EU compare?Tariffs - taxes that are levied only on imported goods - are the most readily quantified and compared. For the most part, the EU's tariffs are relatively low. There are a number of ways of calculating an average. You can take a ""simple"" average, or you can weight the tariffs in line with the amount of trade that's affected. Both have drawbacks and advantages.Then you can look at ""bound"" tariffs, the amount that countries have pledged in the World Trade Organization that they won't exceed. Or you can look at applied tariffs, the amount they actually impose which can be lower, sometimes by a large margin. On any basis, the EU's average tariffs are fairly moderate but certainly not the lowest. The lowest figure for the EU is the trade-weighted figure for applied tariffs (the most recent in the WTO database is 2015). It was 3%. That's higher than the US (2.3%) and Japan (2.1%), but lower than Australia (4%) or Canada (but only just at 3.1%). Some developing countries have higher levels, such as 10.4% for Brazil.But the major developed economies can't match Hong Kong, which has no tariffs. If you drill down into particular sectors, then you get a more varied picture. Tariffs on farm produce tend to be higher, including in the EU. The trade-weighted average is 7.8%, and that is a good deal higher than the US figure of 3.8%. But if you want to sell agricultural goods into Switzerland there's an average tariff of nearly 30%. One complaint sometimes made against the EU by its British opponents is about tariffs on goods from developing countries, notably from Africa. Although there are some tariffs, most African nations benefit from an EU arrangement that allows almost completely tariff and quota free access for their goods. It's known as Everything but Arms. It applies to those nations (not just in Africa) classified as least developed.    Many others benefit from Economic Partnership Agreements or other arrangements that give extensive tariff-free access to the EU market. The EU also has free trade agreements which allow many other countries duty free access (though not necessarily for all goods). Among others that covers Canada, Chile and South Korea. Japan has such an agreement with the EU though it has not yet come into force. The big gap on that list is the US. Negotiations were launched in 2013 though they have stalled.  Nor does the EU have free trade agreements with the two largest developing economies, China or India. In the case of India talks have made slow progress, partly due to British reluctance to agree the more liberal visa regime sought by New Delhi. With China the EU is negotiating an investment agreement, but not a trade deal. There's more to trade barriers than tariffs, however. The other things that exporters have to contend with are known collectively as - surprisingly enough - non-tariff barriers (NTBs). They include product standards, health and safety regulations, and labelling requirements. In many service industries there are licensing requirements and restrictions on who is eligible for authorisation. Although suppliers may have to comply with such rules in their home market, if they want to sell into a country where the rules are different there is likely to be additional cost. More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:There are often good reasons for such barriers - such as protecting consumers - but they do have an impact on trade and they can be a form of disguised protection for national suppliers. One of the few analyses arguing that Brexit would be economically beneficial was based on the idea of the UK eliminating tariffs and also NTBs.Is the EU especially guilty in this area? NTBs are hard to quantify and compare, though some economists have tried.One analysis looked at measures to restrict trade that countries are required to report to the World Trade Organization. The EU came third behind the US and China for the number of measures notified. Looking at service industries, all barriers to trade are NTBs. There are no tariffs on services. In this sector the EU's single market is less complete than it is for goods, so research by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) looked at individual EU countries.  The report covered 22 service industries in 44 nations (rich countries and some of the more advanced emerging economies) 23 of them EU members. Eight of the 10 least restrictive were EU members. The EU also supports its farmers with subsidies. The system clearly helps them survive in the face of international competition. The OECD's estimate of total subsidies to farmers was close to $100bn in 2016. But the EU is a very large economy and if you look at how much of farmers' incomes come from subsidies the EU doesn't stand out so much. It's more generous to farmers than the US but less than Japan, South Korea, Norway, Iceland or Switzerland. The conclusion is that the EU does indeed protect some of its producers, especially farmers, from outside competition, although the EU's single market means they are fully exposed to competition from within the EU.  The EU can't claim to be the world's freest trader, but on many measures it's toward the more liberal end of the spectrum. Britain may be able to go even further in that direction and remove barriers to trade unilaterally. That will depend on what withdrawal agreement is reached with the EU and on a political judgement by the government about what changes to, for example, food standards it - and voters - are willing to accept.

2018-06-02,Arts outside the EU,https://web.archive.org//web/20180603063706/http://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-44300562,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowFrom Adele to James Bond, from David Hockney to Harry Potter, the UK's creative talent is admired around the globe. And the creative industries are one of the UK's fastest growing sectors, growing at twice the rate of the overall economy.Those in the creative industries are far more anti-Brexit than the rest of the country - a poll by the Creative Industries Federation (CIF) found 96% of its members voted Remain in the 2016 referendum.Personal politics aside, there are practical reasons why people in the arts are worried that Brexit will be bad news - including their concerns about free movement of talent, funding and Britain's reputation around the world.But others are seeing silver linings.Here are some of the ways Brexit could affect the UK's creative industries and talent. Arctic Monkeys, Idles (pictured), Chvrches and Jorja Smith are just some of the 40 UK acts travelling to play at this weekend's Primavera Sound festival in Barcelona.As well as worries about the end of free movement having an impact on people wanting to live and work in another country, there are also concerns that it will make it more difficult for musicians and other performers to go on tour.They may need visas for themselves and their crew, and could need carnets - documents allowing the temporary movement of goods - for their instruments and equipment.There might also be complex tax procedures and lengthy customs checks. All that could be expensive and time-consuming to organise.Big-name acts will probably feel the effects less, but there are fears that it will be prohibitive for up-and-coming artists and larger ensembles.The same applies to European performers wanting to travel to the UK.Former Labour MP Michael Dugher, chief executive of trade body UK Music, has called on the government to bring in a ""touring passport"" to get around any extra red tape and cost.Britain's film and TV industries have been booming of late, thanks largely to Hollywood studios choosing the UK to film blockbusters like Solo: A Star Wars Story, Mission: Impossible - Fallout and Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom.Foreign studios spent £1.7bn in the UK in 2017 - almost double the amount spent four years previously. Most of that money came from America, encouraged by the fall in the value of the pound after the UK voted to leave the EU, which makes it more attractive for US studios to film in the UK. If, as Brexiteers hope, a wide-ranging free trade deal is struck with the US, the trend could well continue.Some film-makers are worried about being able to recruit crew members from Europe to work in the UK, though, and have voiced concerns about European co-productions, funding and distribution schemes.However, Lord Puttnam, who produced Chariots of Fire and is president of the Film Distributors' Association, has said more investment in home-grown films ""with a distinctive British voice could help to deliver a form of national re-branding"".If the UK had never been in the EU, children's favourite The Gruffalo - one of every child's favourite books - wouldn't have existed, its German-born illustrator Axel Scheffler recently said.He brought the character - and many others - to life, working with writer Julia Donaldson in what must be one of the most successful UK-EU creative partnerships.He moved to the UK 36 years ago and said that without free movement, he wouldn't have been able to make his home in Britain and team up with Donaldson.Scheffler is one of thousands of Europeans in creative jobs in the UK - the CIF estimated there were at least 130,000 EU nationals working in the sector in 2016.Some areas rely on European talent more than others. An estimated 30% of people working in visual effects for film and TV were from the EU, with the figure at 20-30% for video games and 25% for architecture.One of the biggest concerns about Brexit is that some of those people will want to - or be forced to - go home. It's also feared that others will be put off coming to the UK or be unable to do so, meaning artistic collaborations may not happen and some companies may struggle to attract the necessary talent.In December, a joint document issued by the UK government and the EU said both EU citizens and UK nationals will be able ""to live, work or study as they currently do under the same conditions as under Union law"" after Brexit.The late Martin Roth, the German museum director who took London's V&A to new heights, said upon his departure in September 2016 that he might not have taken the post if it had come up after the EU referendum.""I'd probably still be offered a job, but the question is rather, would that job still be as attractive in such a context?"" he said.UK media watchdog Ofcom currently regulates around 1,200 TV services. But almost a third of those do not broadcast to UK viewers.They are based in the UK - but the current ""country of origin"" rule says media outlets can serve the whole of the EU as long as they abide by the rules of their host country. Some of these companies are considering relocating if they can no longer reach the whole of the EU from the UK, while others have put plans for new investment in the UK on hold, Ofcom said last year.The Guardian has reported that Discovery is planning to move its European playout hub from London.English arts organisations received £345m from the EU between 2007 and 2016, according to Arts Council England (ACE).However, an ACE report said only 14% of its organisations have direct EU funding, with 30% of the organisations saying they have benefitted indirectly from EU funding.Those getting funding include the Hall for Cornwall in Truro, which has £2.1m European Regional Development Funding to help pay for a new creative industries workspace unit.In August 2016, the government said it would guarantee to support some EU-funded projects after the UK leaves the EU.Amid all the speculation about what might happen after Brexit, there is one concrete consequence we do know about.In November, the European Commission cancelled the UK's turn to host the European Capital of Culture in 2023 - because the UK will have left the EU by then.Dundee, Nottingham, Leeds, Milton Keynes and Belfast/Derry had their eyes on the boost to their economies and images that the title would have brought.When Liverpool was the UK's last Capital of Culture in 2008, it saw an extra 9.7 million visits and a £750m injection into the local economy.When ACE published a survey of its members' views on Brexit in February, one of the key concerns was that the vote would harm the UK's global standing.""There are significant concerns about the potential negative impact of Brexit on the UK's international reputation for arts and culture,"" its report said.One of the organisations quoted, Newcastle-based Isis Arts, works with many European partners.""People are not looking to us in quite the same way that they might have done before,"" they said. ""Our position over there in these other countries is slipping away from us. It's such a shame because we were held in very high regard.""But the CIF points out that there are opportunities for British firms and talent beyond the EU.It talks about catering for ""the expanding middle class in nations from Chile to China"", especially through new digital technologies.Architects' body RIBA says the UK can fill a skills shortage in the US, while institutions like the V&A and the British Museum have been making inroads in Asia and the Middle East.The CIF quotes Diane Banks of Diane Banks Associates Literary & Talent Agency as saying: ""Investors are much more interested in our access to North American and Asian markets than the EU as these markets offer the highest growth potential, particularly when dealing with an English-language product.""Leaving the EU will also present exciting opportunities to innovate and be more competitive.""Michael Lightfoot, who started the group Artists For Brexit, says: ""We are very keen on trying to promote the notion of global Britain. You're shifting your emphasis to being interested in and having equitable exchange with the world, which has got to be brilliant for the arts.""There are other big issues for people across the British creative sector - who say copyright protection should be maintained, data should still be able to flow freely between the UK and EU, and tariffs shouldn't raise costs for businesses and prices for consumers on exporting things like books, video games and art.Aside from the economic implications, we're seeing a new breed of artists and writers who have been stirred to give their creative responses to Brexit and the wider political climate.The Young Vic's incoming artistic director Kwame Kwei-Armah (pictured) recently told The Stage: ""We can't rest on our laurels, but we're in great shape as a country [for political writing] because Brexit, wherever you sit on it, has awoken a generation [of playwrights].""At the very least, Brexit has given Benedict Cumberbatch another job.Thankfully - or not, depending on your view - the Eurovision Song Contest has nothing to do with the European Union.Israel, Azerbaijan and Australia are among the non-EU countries who take part in the annual song extravaganza. So the UK can continue to compete.Unfortunately, Eurovision is the one part of the creative sector where the UK is a consistent failure."

Here are some of those that went before her.The Green Party effectively began life after a Coventry couple got a group of friends together to discuss a Playboy article on rainforest destruction.Out of that 1973 meeting a small party called People was born which fielded just five candidates in the February 1974 general election.The following year People became the Ecology Party and adopted the ""Manifesto for a Sustainable Society"".The document would eventually become the ""philosophical and policy"" blueprint for the Green Party which came into being in 1985. The Scottish Green Party became a separate party in 1990, hence the party we are referring to here is the Green Party of England and Wales. The party prided itself on taking a different, non-hierarchical approach to politics and initially did not have a leader, electing two principal speakers - a male and a female - instead. They ditched that system in 2008, with the aim of generating more media coverage, but the move was not popular with everyone in the party.The Greens' first solo leader was Caroline Lucas. A member of the European Parliament since 1999, she was an accomplished media performer who believed giving the party a single, recognisable face would help draw attention to its policies.She succeeded in gaining the party a long-coveted toe-hold at Westminster, when she was elected MP for Brighton Pavilion in 2010 by a margin of 1,252. She won 31.3% of the votes on a turnout of 70%. But two years later she announced she was standing down as leader, to allow others in the party to build up their profile. The previously little-known Australian journalist replaced Caroline Lucas as party leader in 2012, winning 42.2% of the votes in the party's leadership election. She won overwhelmingly again in 2014.She had previously stood - unsuccessfully - for the Greens in the 2006 and 2010 Camden Council elections and stood for the Parliamentary seat of Holborn and St Pancras in 2010. She came fourth with 2.7% of the vote.Ms Bennett targeted disaffected Labour voters with an anti-austerity message and succeeded in doubling the party's share of the vote at the 2015 general election, gaining prime time exposure in televised debates. She also led the party during the EU referendum campaign, backing the Remain side.But as someone new to frontline politics she sometimes struggled with media appearances, famously suffering what she described as ""brain fade"" while trying to explain the party's housing policy in a live radio interview.In a bit of a return to the early days of having two people sharing the leadership role, Caroline Lucas and Jonathan Bartley stood on a joint ticket and won 86% of the vote in the 2016 Green leadership election, on a turnout of 29.8%.Bartley, like Natalie Bennett a relative newcomer to Green politics, had previously been a think tank director and a leading voice in the ill-fated campaign to change Britain's voting system in the 2011 AV referendum.He did not stand for election at the 2017 general election. He had previously stood unsuccessfully for the Green candidacy at the 2016 London mayoral election, and for the London constituency of Streatham in the 2015 general election. He finally gained elected office in May this year, when he became a councillor in Lambeth, South London, and is now leader of the official opposition to Labour there. At the 2017 general election. Lucas and Bartley enthusiastically embraced the idea of a ""progressive alliance"" of left-leaning parties joining forces to fight the Conservatives. But some in the party were unhappy at being asked to stand aside for Labour or Lib Dem candidates and the party saw its share of the vote more than halve from 2015, with just 1.5% of votes cast. One bright spot was that Caroline Lucas successfully defended her Brighton seat.Prior to 2008 the party had two principal speakers rather than a leader. Here are some of those who held the role:A seasoned activist and campaigner, Sian Berry has been a member of the London Assembly since 2016 and a member of Camden council since 2014, increasing her majority in the Hampstead and Highgate ward earlier this month.She came fourth in the 2008 London mayoral elections and went one better in 2016, overtaking the Liberal Democrats to come third.She was one of the Green Party's principal speakers from 2006 to 2007 and was a founder of the Alliance against Urban 4x4s and a supporter of the Reheat Britain scheme that secured a boiler scrappage scheme in 2009.An economics lecturer with a long history of Green activism, having joined the Ecology Party in 1980, Derek Wall is a leading figure in the ""eco-socialist"" wing of the party, sometimes referred to as Red Greens, for their anti-capitalist views.At the 2005 general election, he stood unsuccessfully as a candidate for Windsor, coming fourth with 2.5% of the vote.He was the Green Party's last male principal speaker, from 2006 to 2007 (alongside Sian Berry) and from 2007 to 2008 (alongside Caroline Lucas). He campaigned against the proposed single leader system, describing the title of leader as ""embarrassing"" and ""patronising"", and comparing a party with a leader to a flock of sheep with a shepherd. He stood against Theresa May in Maidenhead in last year's general election, gaining 2% of the vote.Having joined what was then the Ecology Party in 1977, Jean Lambert became female principal speaker from 1992 to 1993, alongside Richard Lawson, followed by Mallen Baker, and again from 1998 to 1999, alongside Mike Woodin.The former teacher from Walthamstow, East London, was - alongside Caroline Lucas - the first Green politician to win a seat in the European Parliament in 1999. She won 87,545 votes (7.7 %) and was re-elected in 2004 and again in 2014. She served as vice president of the Greens/European Free Alliance Group of MEPs.An influential figure in the early years of the party, who sought to combine what he described in a 1998 article as ""my two personal worlds - of Ecology Party meetings and actions on the one hand, and of a cultural 'hippy revolution' on the other"", he advocated non-violent direct action and a decentralised party structure.In the 1980s, he founded the Green Gatherings festival and the Greenfields area at Glastonbury festival, coordinating litter picking operations.He was the party's male principal speaker from 1994 to 1995 alongside Jan Clark, and from 1995 and 1997 alongside Peg Alexander.Keith Taylor was a key figure in building up the Green Party's Brighton powerbase, first as a councillor and then as a Parliamentary candidate.He gained 9.3% of the vote in the 2001 general election and then 21.9% in 2005, missing out on a seat at Westminster.After being elected male principal speaker in 2005, narrowly beating Derek Wall, he revealed he had been banned from every Tesco store in the country after staging demonstrations against the building of a new supermarket in Bristol in the early 1990s.He served alongside Caroline Lucas in the principal speaker role for a year, before being defeated by Mr Wall by 767 votes to 705.But he was able to take up a seat in the European Parliament, when Ms Lucas became an MP in 2010. He was re-elected as an MEP for the South-East of England in 2014."
2018-06-02,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20180603063706/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks  have now moved on to future relations - after agreement was reached on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are just beginning. Both sides hope they can agree within six months on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all.  Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide, but first let's go back to the basics...It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro.Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.5%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand near a 40-year year low of 4.3%. Annual house price increases have fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 4.9% in the year to January 2018, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May is seeking to put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. If passed, it will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, is supposed to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said continued membership of the single market has to be an option in negotiations with Brussels.   Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The single market is a very different beast - it is not just about the trade in goods. It allows the free movement of people, money and services as if the EU was a single country.Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each playing roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border check for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanAn agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement.The full details are not yet known but UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72.We don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pounds buy fewer euros. A slump in the value of the dollar means the exchange rate with the pound is pretty close to where it was before the referendum.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.A method for calculating the bill has been agreed, but the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more.The question of how and when payments will be made still needs to resolved, but it will be a schedule lasting for many years to come, and it is highly unlikely that anyone will ever be able to give an exact figure for the size of the divorce bill.UK sources say it will be up to £40bn, but some EU sources expect it to be higher than that. No-one can say for sure, and both sides want to keep it that way.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 6.5% in 2016 to 2.7% in 2017, according to the Halifax. It said the slowdown was driven by a squeeze on real wage growth.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-06-02,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180603063706/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to £840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

On the two previous occasions in 1970 and February 1974 the PM and the party lost office. While there is no other conceivable administration in the new parliament other than a Conservative-led one, it remains to be seen whether the PM will retain her position. However, so long as the Conservatives can reach an accommodation with the DUP they will have a working majority in the House of Commons.  BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed:When the general election exit poll was revealed at 10pm, the pound immediately dropped by 2% as investors took a position that a hung parliament was a possible outcome of the general election.Why would that cause the currency to decline? Because a hung parliament means that the government's direction of travel would be less certain.

Sajid Javid told the BBC there was a ""perception problem"" over the decision to include students in net migration figures.And he said he would ""think more carefully"" about the cap on the number of skilled workers given visas.Mr Javid became home secretary in April after Amber Rudd quit.Speaking to the Andrew Marr Show, he also said he would be lobbying Chancellor Philip Hammond for more cash for policing, and promised an increase in security officers to boost counter-terrorism efforts.However, Mr Javid said that addressing the issue of the Windrush scandal, which led to Ms Rudd's resignation, would be his top priority.He told the Marr show that changes had already been made to the ""hostile environment"" approach to illegal immigration, which critics say was responsible for the problems.These changes included rethinking restrictions on illegal migrants' rights to open bank accounts, he said.On the wider approach to immigration, Prime Minister Theresa May has faced repeated calls to exclude foreign students from the government's drive to reduce net migration into the UK, including from Scottish Conservatives leader Ruth Davidson.Mr Javid said he understood criticism of the policy, and that he did ""empathise"" with the view that it did not sound very welcoming.He said that although if students eventually left the country it should have no long-term impact, ""there is a perception problem around this,"" adding: ""It's something I've long considered.""It is ""something I would like to look at again"", he said.The home secretary was also asked about the so-called Tier 2 visa system, introduced by Mrs May when she was home secretary as a means of capping the number of skilled workers from outside the European Union who had a job offer.An annual 20,700 cap has led to thousands of IT specialists and engineers as well as NHS staff being denied visas.""I see the problem with that,"" Mr Javid said.""It is something that I'm taking a fresh look at. I know a number of my colleagues certainly want me to take a look at this, and that's exactly what I'm doing.""And I hope to think about this more carefully and see what can be done."""

Ministers have reportedly been at odds over whether military veterans will be offered enough protection.The idea of a statute of limitations - also referred to as an ""amnesty"" - has been opposed by Sinn Fein, while DUP leader Arlene Foster has also expressed reservations.Speaking on BBC Radio 5 live's Pienaar's Politics, Mr Ellwood said he ""knocked over a few milk bottles"" during his Army days when he served in Northern Ireland.""I don't want somebody knocking on my door, I don't want anybody knocking, asking for any members of my platoon that I served with, to ask questions of something that happened so many years ago,"" he said.""But I also reflect on where things are with the border that I then witnessed, I would not want to see us go back to any form of that situation, so we must resolve this situation.""Asked whether a statute of limitations should be included, he said: ""There's a consultation, I personally would like to see this considered - but it's not for me to make that judgement.""He added: ""It does make sense to draw a line at some point to say that investigations have taken place to their conclusion and unless there's compelling evidence put forward to a very high court...we then close the books on that particular matter.""However, there is a consultation taking place, these arguments I think will be put into that consultation and I hope common sense will then prevail.""At the moment you are hearing of the historic allegations team, this Northern Ireland operation, knocking on doors of people who are now in their eighties asking for questions.""That cannot be how we should look after our veterans."""

We have to look after people in whatever circumstance they find themselves in.""The party supports abortion in the cases of rape, incest, sexual abuse and fatal foetal abnormality.In an interview with Sky News, Mrs Foster said many pro-life voters in the Republic of Ireland were in shock.""I have had emails from nationalists and republicans in Northern Ireland, not quite believing what is going on and saying they will be voting for the DUP because they believe we're the only party that supports the unborn,"" she said.""There are many people who are shocked in the Republic of Ireland. Whilst I completely acknowledge the result that happened last Saturday, that doesn't take away from the fact that there's a substantial minority of people in the Republic of Ireland who feel very disenfranchised, who feel very alone, who don't feel that anyone speaks for them any more.""Labour MP Stella Creasy also said that the result of the referendum reflects the importance of listening to communities.The politician, who has called for MPs to repeal the 1861 Offences Against the Person Act, which makes abortion illegal, said Mrs Foster is ""the only woman with any choice over abortion in Northern Ireland"".Following Mrs Foster's comments, Mr Paisley said that he had received a letter from a priest in his constituency.I have a letter from a local priest in my constituency thanking the DUP for its stance on these issues and assuring me that he is urging his parishioners to vote DUP because of the stance we take on social matters. https://t.co/Ix3uzw4x9QEnd of Twitter post  by @ianpaisleymp"
2018-06-03,Thorpe scandal suspect 'might not be dead',https://web.archive.org//web/20180603151313/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-44336859,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowA probe into a scandal involving former Liberal leader Jeremy Thorpe is to be revisited, after police admitted that a key suspect may still be alive.A 2015 investigation into the alleged attempted murder of Mr Thorpe's lover - Norman Scott - was closed in 2017. Gwent Police believed Andrew Newton - who claimed he was paid to kill Mr Scott - had died. But the force has now told the BBC this may not be the case.Mr Scott said he thought police were continuing a ""cover-up"". The revelations have been made in the BBC Four documentary The Jeremy Thorpe Scandal. Following the BBC's revelations, the Mail on Sunday said it had tracked down Mr Newton - living under a different name - in Surrey. The paper has published what it claims is a picture of Mr Newton, taken on Saturday. The man's face cannot be seen.Mr Thorpe, who died in 2014, was accused of hiring a hitman to murder Mr Scott but was acquitted at an Old Bailey trial in 1979.The fresh investigation was launched by Gwent Police in 2015 after new claims emerged. But the police's belief that Newton - who was convicted of shooting Mr Scott's dog in 1975 - had died, led the Crown Prosecution Service to close it last year.Gwent Police told documentary makers enquiries made as part of the investigation had ""indicated Newton was deceased"".  But they added: ""We have now revisited these enquiries and have identified information which indicates that Newton may still be alive.""The force said it planned to assess if Mr Newton ""is able to assist the investigation"".When asked on Saturday night about the Mail on Sunday's claims to have tracked Mr Newton to Surrey, Gwent Police said it had ""lines of inquiry open"" but would not provide further comment ""at this time"".BBC Panorama journalist Tom Mangold, who has investigated the case since the 1970s, said the 2015 investigation hinged on the story of a man he had met called Dennis Meighan.Mr Meighan told the veteran reporter he was originally approached to carry out the murder - but he claims his police statement was later doctored to remove incriminating references to the Liberal Party and to Mr Thorpe.Following Gwent Police's admission that Newton could still be alive, Mr Mangold insisted the investigation ""must start again"".And reacting to the news, Mr Scott, 78, told the documentary: ""I just don't think anyone's tried hard enough to look for him. I really don't. ""There must be people who knew him and there would surely be a record of him dying.""I thought [Gwent Police] were doing something at last, and soon found out that absolutely they weren't, they were continuing the cover up as far as I can see.""The programme includes unearthed footage from a Panorama programme from 1979 that was never broadcast for legal reasons, after Mr Thorpe and his three co-defendants were acquitted of conspiracy to murder.The director general at the time kept a master copy of the programme but ordered all other copies to be destroyed. But journalist Tom Mangold kept his copy of the report.The programme will air after the end of the dramatisation A Very British Scandal, which stars Hugh Grant as Jeremy Thorpe and Ben Whishaw as Norman Scott.The Jeremy Thorpe Scandal will be broadcast on Sunday at 22:00 BST."
2018-06-03,Teacher agencies face fees crackdown,https://web.archive.org//web/20180603151313/http://www.bbc.com/news/education-44334806,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowRecruitment agencies that charge schools in England ""excessive"" fees to find and hire staff face a crackdown by the education secretary. The move comes amid repeated warnings from school leaders that their budgets are in crisis. Last month, Damian Hinds promised head teachers he would work with schools to drive down unnecessary costs. Head teachers' unions welcomed the plan but called for action on underlying budget problems and teacher shortages.By announcing the clampdown, Mr Hinds is following up on a promise made to the National Association of Head Teachers' conference in Liverpool.In the speech for week, he pledged to work with heads ""to bear down on some of the cost pressures as best as we can"" - but did not offer any prospect of extra funding in the short term.He also promised to make tackling teacher shortages a priority. The latest announcement aims to curb the fees that agencies can charge to advertise vacancies and recruit supply staff for both short and longer term jobs. It says: ""Some agencies charge schools costly finders' fees if head teachers want to make supply staff permanent and do not set out how much they are charging on top of the basic wages paid to supply staff.""   Advertising staff vacancies costs schools in England up to £75m a year, it adds.  The measures include: Mr Hinds said the plan would help schools control costs ""so they can invest more on their front line"". ""Every pound that's spent on excessive agency fees, or on advertising jobs, is a pound that I want to help schools spend on what really matters: making sure every child, whatever their background, is inspired to learn and to reach their potential.""He said it would help head teachers recruit the staff they need and ensure that ""teaching continues to be an attractive, rewarding profession"". The NAHT called the approach a step in the right direction. ""Unfortunately their proposals don't go as far as NAHT's call for a cap on the fees that agencies can charge, as there is in the NHS,"" said head of policy, Valentine Mulholland. He said too few new teachers were coming through, while experienced staff were leaving prematurely.""The solution that all schools are crying out for is more money overall and a better deal for teachers, who have seen their workload rise and salaries fall in real terms for nearly a decade.""Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said reducing the cost of supply teacher agencies would be welcome.   But he warned that these costs were ""driven upwards by the fact that schools have to constantly plug gaps because of the ongoing crisis in teacher recruitment and retention"". ""The government must recognise that trimming costs is not enough to address the massive funding shortfall facing schools and colleges. ""It has to invest more in education and in the young people of this country."""

On Friday, Mrs May said she was ""disappointed"" at the US decision - which will see a 25% duty on European steel and a 10% duty on European aluminium - and that the taxes were ""unjustified"".  Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Dr Fox said the UK was still seeking exemptions from the tariffs.""We will still be making that case throughout this week,"" he said. He added: ""The United States believes, I believe wrongly and illegally, that this is a national security matter for the US.""Given that we export some pretty complex steel products to the United States which are part of their national security programmes themselves, this reasoning that is given is wrong and therefore we believe unlawful.""President Trump originally imposed the tariffs in March, claiming that if the US remained reliant on imported metals, it would threaten the country's national security and damage its own metal industry.The tariffs apply to a wide range of steel and aluminium products such as sheets, plates, bars, pipes and ""semi-finished"" products.President Trump initially exempted Canada, Mexico and the EU from the tariffs to allow time for negotiations. However, the exemption ended at midnight on Thursday, meaning the new taxes would be collected from Friday. According to UK Steel - the body which represents steel producers across the country - 7% of steel exports go to the US, worth £360m.About 31,000 people across the UK work in steel production and many more in the supply chain, with steel mills in the North East, East Midlands, Yorkshire, and Wales.The head of UK Steel, Gareth Stace, said EU leaders had a ""gun held to their head"" and while he admitted that there was a problem of global over-capacity in the industry, he claimed most of that was in China.He said that about 20 million tonnes of Chinese steel would need to ""find a new home to go to"" because of the tariffs.""Because we are a free and open market here in the UK/the EU, it'll come here, we believe, and therefore further damage our sector - not only from the direct impact of tariffs in the US but the surge of steel coming here,"" he added. UK exports of aluminium to the US are small, but the UK's Aluminium Federation said it was concerned about the impact the tariffs could have, hindering free trade.Dr Fox travelled to Washington in March to seek a further exemption for the UK, as there are concerns it could impact the UK market by increasing its prices, but he was unsuccessful. Earlier this week, he called the tariff proposals ""disappointing"" and ""absurd"".Dr Fox's comments follow those of EU trade commissioner, Cecilia Malmstrom, who also called the new tariffs illegal and said the US was playing a ""dangerous game"". French President Emmanuel Macron backed the position, telling President Trump the duties were illegal over the telephone. But Dr Fox warned against a ""tit-for-tat"" escalation in the light of EU counter measures, adding: ""There can be no victors in a trade war, only casualties.""   The EU has drawn up a target list of 100 US goods worth €2.8bn ($3.5bn, £2.5bn) for its retaliatory tariffs, the BBC understands.The 10-page list includes Harley Davidson motorcycles, bourbon, Florida orange juice, cosmetics and jeans.If the list is implemented, it could lead to many every day items becoming more expensive for shoppers in the UK, as shops pass on increased import prices."

""I am concerned, and I think the public will rightly be concerned, that further costs are being incurred at a time when the commission does not even have an executive to hand their final report to,"" he added.The commission was supposed to report its findings in December 2017, but the Executive Office said work was ""ongoing"" and plans to implement the findings will be decided when a report is agreed.BBC News NI understands that a draft report has been written, but any final report and recommendations would need to be brought to executive ministers for consideration - something that could not happen until devolution is restored. On Saturday, BBC News NI revealed that the total cost for the commission, from when it was set up on 20 June 2016 to 31 March 2018, was £647,094.About half - £330,020 - has been paid in that period to 14 of the panel's members for remuneration and expenses.The Executive Office said the commission had been tasked with examining a range of ""long standing, complex and challenging areas in relation to the expression of national and cultural identity"" within Northern Ireland.It is also ""not possible"" at this stage to confirm when its work will be concluded, the Executive Office added.A DUP spokesperson said the commission had an important role to play in providing recommendations relating to the issues it was tasked to consider. It is ""deeply disappointing that some of those who complain most loudly about flags continue to block devolution, meaning no ministers are in place to consider a report produced by the group,"" they added.The SDLP and Alliance Party said they supported FICT when it was initially set up, but that the slow pace of output was concerning.The commission, which has 15 members, is co-chaired by Queen's University academic Dr Dominic Bryan and community relations worker Neville Armstrong.Seven members were appointed to the commission by political parties and eight were drawn from a recruitment process.Five of those on the panel have links to unionism. It also includes a former Alliance Party special adviser, a former SDLP adviser and a former Sinn Féin councillor.The only member who does not receive any money is the UUP MLA Doug Beattie, as he is an elected representative.The commission was included as part of the Fresh Start Agreement, negotiated by the Stormont parties in November 2015."
2018-06-03,Calls to waive VAT on repairs after Grenfell,https://web.archive.org//web/20180603151313/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-44343433,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowCladding removal work in the wake of the Grenfell tragedy should be exempt from VAT, according to Scotland's housing minister.Kevin Stewart has written to the UK Treasury calling for the tax to be waived for work carried out in the wake of the tower fire.He said it would be ""immoral"" for the UK government to make money from work to remove combustible cladding.The UK government is to fund the replacement for social housing.The prime minister has committed to spending about £400m to pay for councils and housing associations to replace the potentially dangerous material on tower blocks.But the owners of private buildings have to pay for repairs themselves. Mr Stewart said those living in privately owned buildings would face significant costs to ensure their homes are safe.Cladding fuelled the spread of the fire that killed 71 people in the west London block in June last year, and a subsequent safety operation identified hundreds more buildings with similar set-ups.Mr Stewart said: ""We welcome the recent announcement that the UK government will fund replacement cladding for social high-rise domestic buildings, however that funding will not be extended to owners of private high-rise buildings.""This means that in order to make their homes safe, individual owners will need to fund the full cost of replacing unsafe combustible cladding.""These costs run into millions of pounds and are made considerably higher as VAT is payable on this category of repair works. Hundreds of buildings and thousands of individuals across the UK are affected by this.""He added: ""It perturbs me that we find ourselves in a situation where repair work directly linked to the replacement of ACM cladding, in order to ensure the long term fire safety of residents, will ultimately result in additional revenue to HM Treasury.""The UK Treasury has been approached for comment."

If the authorities don't see that they have had a serious failure of common sense and compassion.""Mr Flack has written to European Parliament President Antonio Tajani, and Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov to stop what he calls ""a travesty of justice"".A petition has also been raised by the Daily Telegraph to save the beleaguered bovine on compassionate grounds."

We await written proposals from the British side.""In February, the EU proposed a backstop which would involve the UK, in respect of Northern Ireland, maintaining full alignment with those rules of the EU's single market and customs union which support north-south cooperation.Prime Minister Theresa May said she could never agree to that as it would ""threaten the constitutional integrity of the UK by creating a customs and regulatory border down the Irish Sea""."

""It was the French authorities who told me that I should apply for a carte de sejour. Nothing else has changed.""A carte de sejour shows a person is legally resident in France and it is hoped possession of such documentation will help avoid complications after Brexit.In his interview with Connexion, an English-language French magazine for expats, Lord Lawson said he believes the issue of Britons living in other EU countries will be sorted out in Brexit talks but that trade was a ""problem"", along with the Irish border issue.""I think the issue could be no trade deal. There will be agreement on expats and security,"" he said.""It's not helped by the fact the current government is weak and is not doing a particularly good job.

""It comes under the category of 'tiresome' rather than 'serious'. I understand some people are worried about healthcare cover and hope it will be sorted out.

""We've been left in limbo,"" says Fiona Godfrey, a freelance legal consultant living with her family in Luxembourg who also volunteers with the pressure group British in Europe. ""I think it's shameful. We should never ever have been put in this position."" The dilemma is that what has been agreed so far between the UK government and the EU - in the Withdrawal Agreement they are negotiating - will only give British citizens the right to live and work in the country where they reside. In Fiona's case, that means tiny Luxembourg. But at the moment she works in other countries every week, relying on her rights of freedom of movement within the EU single market. ""In 20 years I've worked in every EU member state, plus Norway and Switzerland,"" she says. ""We want to keep the rights we have - we need to keep our free movement, we need to keep our rights to work, and we need to keep recognition of our professional qualifications, because that is another huge issue.""Some UK citizens in the EU will be able to continue to work as they do now. If, for example, you are defined as a frontier worker - crossing a border on a regular basis for a nine-to-five job on a regular employment contract - then you should be OK. But if you are defined as a cross-border supplier of services there is no guarantee as yet that you'll be able to work after Brexit as you do now.  New restrictions could apply to all sorts of people:  lawyers, architects, truckers… or freelance chefs cooking for hungry skiers in the French Alps.""It's been very stressful. Nearly two years now, and we still have no clarity on what is going to happen and how we are going to be affected,"" says Helen Malaburn, speaking from her home near Les Trois Vallees in France. She and her husband have lived there for 10 years, cooking for tourists and local residents during the winter ski season. But in the summer, the work dries up, and they spend their time working in places like Greece and Spain. ""At the moment, we do approximately half of our work outside France,"" Helen says. ""There's no way we could sustain ourselves on the winter work that we do.""""We're completely dependent on being able to work across the EU, and having our qualifications (as chefs) recognised in every country, like they are now."" Helen and Fiona are not alone. The debate about UK citizens living in the EU often focuses on pensioners seeking warmer weather - and they certainly have concerns of their own. But roughly 80% of the one million or so Brits in the EU are of working age or younger.There is a lack of clarity on a number of other issues that concern them. It is still not clear, for example, whether UK citizens in the EU will have access to university education on the same financial terms as they do now; nor whether - as part of a bureaucratic process - they will have to make new applications to remain in the countries where they live. One solution to the dilemma facing so many people is to apply for dual citizenship. Both Helen and Fiona are in the process of doing so, as are many of their British counterparts. But it's not an option available in every country - Austria and the Netherlands, for example, don't allow it and other countries have some restrictions. Nor is there a guarantee of success, and the application process takes time. And that is the one thing that is now in short supply. The European Parliament has promised to take a tough line on protecting citizens' rights, and the Dutch MEP Sophie in 't Veld is critical of both sides in the Brexit negotiations.  ""They're making it into a legalistic issue,"" she says, ""but this is about the fundamental rights of people who have set up their lives here in Europe and are counting on free movement.""So this is a condition for the European Parliament to give its consent to the Withdrawal Agreement.""Does she think the European Parliament would otherwise struggle to approve the agreement (which it has to do before Brexit happens)? ""Yes. We have adopted a series of resolutions where we set out our conditions for giving consent, and this is one of them.""So when can UK citizens expect their concerns to be addressed? The EU says the whole notion of ""mobility of citizens"" will be part of negotiations on the future relationship between the UK and the EU. But those talks have barely begun, and they won't be concluded by the time Brexit is due to take place in ten months' time. The fear is that ""mobility of citizens"" would then get caught up in haggling over all sorts of other issues in negotiations on a future free trade agreement. It wouldn't be a comfortable place to be. ""I don't feel like a bargaining chip, I am a bargaining chip, and I shouldn't be,"" says Fiona Godfrey. On behalf of British in Europe, she has this appeal for Theresa May: ""Write to the member states, write to (Michel) Barnier, and say we would like British citizens to have continuing free movement. ""We think it is a deal that can be done if she just makes the request.""The proposed 21-month transition (or implementation) period after Brexit gives everyone involved a bit of breathing space, but time to include a deal on future free movement in the Withdrawal Agreement is fast running out. So does the government think that is still a possibility? In a written statement, the Department for Exiting the European Union, said: ""We've reached a reciprocal deal for our citizens during the implementation period that recognises the valuable contribution that EU citizens make to the UK, and that UK citizens make to the EU.""The issue of onward movement rights for UK citizens in the EU has not been forgotten and we will raise this in the next phase of negotiations.""The UK will seek to reach a final deal that is in the mutual interest of citizens living across the continent.""But no-one knows when that final deal on the future relationship will be agreed. And the concern among many UK citizens in the EU is that they will have no certainty about their future status, and their ability to work as they do now, until after the UK has left.Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questionsFollow us on Twitter"

She has a death stare which makes Gordon Brown look, by comparison, like the kind of prime minister who'd be dead-legged by a nine-year-old in a school playground. But is she as tough as she looks? Or is Mrs May merely stubborn? And cautious? And rather indecisive?For a prime minister who has - or at least, once had - a reputation for strength, Theresa May's now spending a surprising amount of time being urged behind closed doors in Downing Street to stand up, and face down, the hard-line Brexiteers in her own party. A stream of Tory MPs have been urging Mrs May to defy the hard-line Brexiteers for the sake of striking compromises to achieve what they're calling a sensible Brexit. Three former Cabinet ministers were the latest through the door. Amber Rudd, Justine Greening and her former deputy Damian Green.Green told me, in an interview for BBC Radio 4's World at One: ""There's a danger of assuming that those who shout the loudest represent the most and I think there is a silent majority within the parliamentary party that wants Brexit, that accepts that Brexit is going to happen, but wants it to be a pragmatic and sensible Brexit that means, above all, there's no disruption if we can achieve that.""What, then, about the whispered threat among Brexiteers that Mrs May might face a vote of no confidence, if she strays too far from the Brexit straight and narrow? Was he sure she'd win?""Certainly that, but I think even before that, the vast majority of my colleagues, even those who have been very strongly campaigning for Brexit, recognise that this is absolutely not the time to do that sort of thing.""So what might a so-called sensible Brexit look like? While Cabinet ministers search for agreement on Britain's future customs relationship with the EU - a search which, I'm hearing, is getting nowhere fast - attention's focussing on getting Brussels to agree to the fall-back plan of extending a customs deal until new trade deals are struck, and ensuring British borders have the staff and high-tech equipment to cope.Meanwhile, at Westminster, there is more talk among Tory MPs than many people suppose about perhaps extending some form of single market relationship at the same time.The former head of Theresa May's Policy Board, ex-minister George Freeman, certainly thinks so. And look closely for a phrase which seems to have become fashionable.""The silent majority of the Conservative parliamentary party want the prime minister, and support the prime minister in negotiating a deal where we have as frictionless and as cost-free access to the European market as we can negotiate, and the freedom to do our own deals with the emerging economies,"" he told me.""The mood in the parliamentary party is that the balance of probability falls in terms of staying with our existing market, and the burden of proof falls with those emerging trade deals. If we see them and begin to see what they could be worth then the mood shifts. But right now the vast majority of Conservative MPs want to deliver a prosperity Brexit."" Maybe so, but getting even broad agreement among MPs would be tough.  Getting agreement in Brussels, maybe tougher still.And there's a view among senior Tories that it would take a parliamentary defeat at the hands of Tory rebels and Labour opponents to force Theresa May's hand. Or untie them, depending on your point of view.The Tory rebels' unofficial chief whip in the Commons is Stephen Hammond. Were the rebels who are threatening to vote to stay in the EU Customs Union holding firm? Ready to defeat the Government? The answer was ""yes... if forced"".""But we're a long way away from that. I am trying to work with the government, as a number of others are, to make sure that we can get what the prime minister wants, which is frictionless trade. We need to start concentrating on the interests of British industry. And therefore if in the short term, we need a longer period in the customs union to sort out our new customs arrangements, that's what the government should do,"" he said.Committed, convinced, Brexiteers insist enough compromises have already been made. Peter Bone doesn't shout. He's quite softly spoken. But still manages to make himself clear.""There have been lots and lots of compromises by people who believe in Brexit to keep everyone together,"" he said.""But there are certain things that we've compromised enough on to get agreement and we really can't go any further on those. We shouldn't be listening to people who shout the loudest, we should be talking to everyone and trying to create an agreement that everyone can support. But that has to be based on what the British people voted for.""To state the obvious, Brexit's a struggle. With Brussels. In the Tory party. And remember the wrangling in the Labour Party will be every bit as crucial to the outcome - whatever that may be.But just now, the silent majority in the Tory party, if that's what they are, are keen to give a new meaning to the Brexiteer's favourite slogan. The one about ""Taking back control""."
2018-06-03,Protectionist racket?,https://web.archive.org//web/20180603151313/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-44291103,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowWhen it comes to trade with the rest of the world, the European Union is sometimes accused of having high barriers and protecting its own producers.  It's an allegation that some supporters of Brexit have been making for some time.  The charge has had something of resurgence in the light of the renewed debate about exactly what sort of customs arrangement Britain should have with the European Union in the future. But does it stand up?The EU does certainly have barriers to trade, and they do, one way or another, raise the cost of imported goods. But every country on the planet has some sort of barriers. So how does the EU compare?Tariffs - taxes that are levied only on imported goods - are the most readily quantified and compared. For the most part, the EU's tariffs are relatively low. There are a number of ways of calculating an average. You can take a ""simple"" average, or you can weight the tariffs in line with the amount of trade that's affected. Both have drawbacks and advantages.Then you can look at ""bound"" tariffs, the amount that countries have pledged in the World Trade Organization that they won't exceed. Or you can look at applied tariffs, the amount they actually impose which can be lower, sometimes by a large margin. On any basis, the EU's average tariffs are fairly moderate but certainly not the lowest. The lowest figure for the EU is the trade-weighted figure for applied tariffs (the most recent in the WTO database is 2015). It was 3%. That's higher than the US (2.3%) and Japan (2.1%), but lower than Australia (4%) or Canada (but only just at 3.1%). Some developing countries have higher levels, such as 10.4% for Brazil.But the major developed economies can't match Hong Kong, which has no tariffs. If you drill down into particular sectors, then you get a more varied picture. Tariffs on farm produce tend to be higher, including in the EU. The trade-weighted average is 7.8%, and that is a good deal higher than the US figure of 3.8%. But if you want to sell agricultural goods into Switzerland there's an average tariff of nearly 30%. One complaint sometimes made against the EU by its British opponents is about tariffs on goods from developing countries, notably from Africa. Although there are some tariffs, most African nations benefit from an EU arrangement that allows almost completely tariff and quota free access for their goods. It's known as Everything but Arms. It applies to those nations (not just in Africa) classified as least developed.    Many others benefit from Economic Partnership Agreements or other arrangements that give extensive tariff-free access to the EU market. The EU also has free trade agreements which allow many other countries duty free access (though not necessarily for all goods). Among others that covers Canada, Chile and South Korea. Japan has such an agreement with the EU though it has not yet come into force. The big gap on that list is the US. Negotiations were launched in 2013 though they have stalled.  Nor does the EU have free trade agreements with the two largest developing economies, China or India. In the case of India talks have made slow progress, partly due to British reluctance to agree the more liberal visa regime sought by New Delhi. With China the EU is negotiating an investment agreement, but not a trade deal. There's more to trade barriers than tariffs, however. The other things that exporters have to contend with are known collectively as - surprisingly enough - non-tariff barriers (NTBs). They include product standards, health and safety regulations, and labelling requirements. In many service industries there are licensing requirements and restrictions on who is eligible for authorisation. Although suppliers may have to comply with such rules in their home market, if they want to sell into a country where the rules are different there is likely to be additional cost. More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:There are often good reasons for such barriers - such as protecting consumers - but they do have an impact on trade and they can be a form of disguised protection for national suppliers. One of the few analyses arguing that Brexit would be economically beneficial was based on the idea of the UK eliminating tariffs and also NTBs.Is the EU especially guilty in this area? NTBs are hard to quantify and compare, though some economists have tried.One analysis looked at measures to restrict trade that countries are required to report to the World Trade Organization. The EU came third behind the US and China for the number of measures notified. Looking at service industries, all barriers to trade are NTBs. There are no tariffs on services. In this sector the EU's single market is less complete than it is for goods, so research by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) looked at individual EU countries.  The report covered 22 service industries in 44 nations (rich countries and some of the more advanced emerging economies) 23 of them EU members. Eight of the 10 least restrictive were EU members. The EU also supports its farmers with subsidies. The system clearly helps them survive in the face of international competition. The OECD's estimate of total subsidies to farmers was close to $100bn in 2016. But the EU is a very large economy and if you look at how much of farmers' incomes come from subsidies the EU doesn't stand out so much. It's more generous to farmers than the US but less than Japan, South Korea, Norway, Iceland or Switzerland. The conclusion is that the EU does indeed protect some of its producers, especially farmers, from outside competition, although the EU's single market means they are fully exposed to competition from within the EU.  The EU can't claim to be the world's freest trader, but on many measures it's toward the more liberal end of the spectrum. Britain may be able to go even further in that direction and remove barriers to trade unilaterally. That will depend on what withdrawal agreement is reached with the EU and on a political judgement by the government about what changes to, for example, food standards it - and voters - are willing to accept.

2018-06-03,Arts outside the EU,https://web.archive.org//web/20180603151313/http://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-44300562,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowFrom Adele to James Bond, from David Hockney to Harry Potter, the UK's creative talent is admired around the globe. And the creative industries are one of the UK's fastest growing sectors, growing at twice the rate of the overall economy.Those in the creative industries are far more anti-Brexit than the rest of the country - a poll by the Creative Industries Federation (CIF) found 96% of its members voted Remain in the 2016 referendum.Personal politics aside, there are practical reasons why people in the arts are worried that Brexit will be bad news - including their concerns about free movement of talent, funding and Britain's reputation around the world.But others are seeing silver linings.Here are some of the ways Brexit could affect the UK's creative industries and talent. Arctic Monkeys, Idles (pictured), Chvrches and Jorja Smith are just some of the 40 UK acts travelling to play at this weekend's Primavera Sound festival in Barcelona.As well as worries about the end of free movement having an impact on people wanting to live and work in another country, there are also concerns that it will make it more difficult for musicians and other performers to go on tour.They may need visas for themselves and their crew, and could need carnets - documents allowing the temporary movement of goods - for their instruments and equipment.There might also be complex tax procedures and lengthy customs checks. All that could be expensive and time-consuming to organise.Big-name acts will probably feel the effects less, but there are fears that it will be prohibitive for up-and-coming artists and larger ensembles.The same applies to European performers wanting to travel to the UK.Former Labour MP Michael Dugher, chief executive of trade body UK Music, has called on the government to bring in a ""touring passport"" to get around any extra red tape and cost.Britain's film and TV industries have been booming of late, thanks largely to Hollywood studios choosing the UK to film blockbusters like Solo: A Star Wars Story, Mission: Impossible - Fallout and Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom.Foreign studios spent £1.7bn in the UK in 2017 - almost double the amount spent four years previously. Most of that money came from America, encouraged by the fall in the value of the pound after the UK voted to leave the EU, which makes it more attractive for US studios to film in the UK. If, as Brexiteers hope, a wide-ranging free trade deal is struck with the US, the trend could well continue.Some film-makers are worried about being able to recruit crew members from Europe to work in the UK, though, and have voiced concerns about European co-productions, funding and distribution schemes.However, Lord Puttnam, who produced Chariots of Fire and is president of the Film Distributors' Association, has said more investment in home-grown films ""with a distinctive British voice could help to deliver a form of national re-branding"".If the UK had never been in the EU, children's favourite The Gruffalo - one of every child's favourite books - wouldn't have existed, its German-born illustrator Axel Scheffler recently said.He brought the character - and many others - to life, working with writer Julia Donaldson in what must be one of the most successful UK-EU creative partnerships.He moved to the UK 36 years ago and said that without free movement, he wouldn't have been able to make his home in Britain and team up with Donaldson.Scheffler is one of thousands of Europeans in creative jobs in the UK - the CIF estimated there were at least 130,000 EU nationals working in the sector in 2016.Some areas rely on European talent more than others. An estimated 30% of people working in visual effects for film and TV were from the EU, with the figure at 20-30% for video games and 25% for architecture.One of the biggest concerns about Brexit is that some of those people will want to - or be forced to - go home. It's also feared that others will be put off coming to the UK or be unable to do so, meaning artistic collaborations may not happen and some companies may struggle to attract the necessary talent.In December, a joint document issued by the UK government and the EU said both EU citizens and UK nationals will be able ""to live, work or study as they currently do under the same conditions as under Union law"" after Brexit.The late Martin Roth, the German museum director who took London's V&A to new heights, said upon his departure in September 2016 that he might not have taken the post if it had come up after the EU referendum.""I'd probably still be offered a job, but the question is rather, would that job still be as attractive in such a context?"" he said.UK media watchdog Ofcom currently regulates around 1,200 TV services. But almost a third of those do not broadcast to UK viewers.They are based in the UK - but the current ""country of origin"" rule says media outlets can serve the whole of the EU as long as they abide by the rules of their host country. Some of these companies are considering relocating if they can no longer reach the whole of the EU from the UK, while others have put plans for new investment in the UK on hold, Ofcom said last year.The Guardian has reported that Discovery is planning to move its European playout hub from London.English arts organisations received £345m from the EU between 2007 and 2016, according to Arts Council England (ACE).However, an ACE report said only 14% of its organisations have direct EU funding, with 30% of the organisations saying they have benefitted indirectly from EU funding.Those getting funding include the Hall for Cornwall in Truro, which has £2.1m European Regional Development Funding to help pay for a new creative industries workspace unit.In August 2016, the government said it would guarantee to support some EU-funded projects after the UK leaves the EU.Amid all the speculation about what might happen after Brexit, there is one concrete consequence we do know about.In November, the European Commission cancelled the UK's turn to host the European Capital of Culture in 2023 - because the UK will have left the EU by then.Dundee, Nottingham, Leeds, Milton Keynes and Belfast/Derry had their eyes on the boost to their economies and images that the title would have brought.When Liverpool was the UK's last Capital of Culture in 2008, it saw an extra 9.7 million visits and a £750m injection into the local economy.When ACE published a survey of its members' views on Brexit in February, one of the key concerns was that the vote would harm the UK's global standing.""There are significant concerns about the potential negative impact of Brexit on the UK's international reputation for arts and culture,"" its report said.One of the organisations quoted, Newcastle-based Isis Arts, works with many European partners.""People are not looking to us in quite the same way that they might have done before,"" they said. ""Our position over there in these other countries is slipping away from us. It's such a shame because we were held in very high regard.""But the CIF points out that there are opportunities for British firms and talent beyond the EU.It talks about catering for ""the expanding middle class in nations from Chile to China"", especially through new digital technologies.Architects' body RIBA says the UK can fill a skills shortage in the US, while institutions like the V&A and the British Museum have been making inroads in Asia and the Middle East.The CIF quotes Diane Banks of Diane Banks Associates Literary & Talent Agency as saying: ""Investors are much more interested in our access to North American and Asian markets than the EU as these markets offer the highest growth potential, particularly when dealing with an English-language product.""Leaving the EU will also present exciting opportunities to innovate and be more competitive.""Michael Lightfoot, who started the group Artists For Brexit, says: ""We are very keen on trying to promote the notion of global Britain. You're shifting your emphasis to being interested in and having equitable exchange with the world, which has got to be brilliant for the arts.""There are other big issues for people across the British creative sector - who say copyright protection should be maintained, data should still be able to flow freely between the UK and EU, and tariffs shouldn't raise costs for businesses and prices for consumers on exporting things like books, video games and art.Aside from the economic implications, we're seeing a new breed of artists and writers who have been stirred to give their creative responses to Brexit and the wider political climate.The Young Vic's incoming artistic director Kwame Kwei-Armah (pictured) recently told The Stage: ""We can't rest on our laurels, but we're in great shape as a country [for political writing] because Brexit, wherever you sit on it, has awoken a generation [of playwrights].""At the very least, Brexit has given Benedict Cumberbatch another job.Thankfully - or not, depending on your view - the Eurovision Song Contest has nothing to do with the European Union.Israel, Azerbaijan and Australia are among the non-EU countries who take part in the annual song extravaganza. So the UK can continue to compete.Unfortunately, Eurovision is the one part of the creative sector where the UK is a consistent failure."
2018-06-03,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20180603151313/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks  have now moved on to future relations - after agreement was reached on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are just beginning. Both sides hope they can agree within six months on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all.  Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide, but first let's go back to the basics...It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro.Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.5%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand near a 40-year year low of 4.3%. Annual house price increases have fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 4.9% in the year to January 2018, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May is seeking to put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. If passed, it will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, is supposed to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said continued membership of the single market has to be an option in negotiations with Brussels.   Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The single market is a very different beast - it is not just about the trade in goods. It allows the free movement of people, money and services as if the EU was a single country.Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each playing roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border check for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanAn agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement.The full details are not yet known but UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72.We don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pounds buy fewer euros. A slump in the value of the dollar means the exchange rate with the pound is pretty close to where it was before the referendum.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.A method for calculating the bill has been agreed, but the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more.The question of how and when payments will be made still needs to resolved, but it will be a schedule lasting for many years to come, and it is highly unlikely that anyone will ever be able to give an exact figure for the size of the divorce bill.UK sources say it will be up to £40bn, but some EU sources expect it to be higher than that. No-one can say for sure, and both sides want to keep it that way.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 6.5% in 2016 to 2.7% in 2017, according to the Halifax. It said the slowdown was driven by a squeeze on real wage growth.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-06-03,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180603151313/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to £840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

On the two previous occasions in 1970 and February 1974 the PM and the party lost office. While there is no other conceivable administration in the new parliament other than a Conservative-led one, it remains to be seen whether the PM will retain her position. However, so long as the Conservatives can reach an accommodation with the DUP they will have a working majority in the House of Commons.  BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed:When the general election exit poll was revealed at 10pm, the pound immediately dropped by 2% as investors took a position that a hung parliament was a possible outcome of the general election.Why would that cause the currency to decline?

2018-06-04,Date set for crunch Brexit Commons votes,https://web.archive.org//web/20180604234119/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44360020,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe EU Withdrawal Bill will return to the House of Commons for a series of crunch votes on 12 June, it has been announced.The legislation suffered 15 defeats in the House of Lords, which will now be debated by MPs.Numbers are tight with the Tories needing the support of the Democratic Unionist Party for a majority.Conservative MPs have been told to be on site ""at all times"" during the day of the votes.The prime minister's spokesman confirmed there were Lords amendments the government thinks are unacceptable and will be seeking to overturn.The legislation is a key part of the government's strategy for leaving the EU following 2016's vote in favour of Brexit.It involves transposing EU law into UK law to ensure a smooth transition on Brexit day.But peers have attempted to amend it in several areas, including the customs union, the Irish border and removing the precise date of Brexit - 29 March 2019 - from its wording.The amendments would also give a Parliament a potentially decisive say over Brexit and keep the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights in force in the UK.The votes will all take place on a single day in the House of Commons, Downing Street confirmed.In a letter to Tory MPs, Conservative chief whip Julian Smith said: ""I wanted to again reiterate the importance of the next few weeks. We will be facing a number of votes on important legislation as well as Opposition Day debates.""On Twitter, the Labour Whips' Office said holding all of the votes on one day was ""an absolute disgrace"" and ""must be out of sheer panic"".The Commons ""has had nothing to do for months in terms of substantive business and to try to ram through in one day shows the contempt that the government have for the role of Parliament"", it added."
2018-06-04,Cabinet set for Heathrow runway decision,https://web.archive.org//web/20180604234119/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44357580,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowSenior ministers will gather in Downing Street this morning to approve what amounts to outline planning permission for a third runway at Heathrow Airport.The economic sub-committee, chaired by Theresa May, is expected to sign off the expansion plan, and then send it for approval by the full cabinet.If backed, MPs would then be asked to vote on the issue in the coming weeks. The government has backed expansion in principle despite opposition from key figures such as Boris Johnson.If the plan is backed by the cabinet, Transport Secretary Chris Grayling could come forward with the statement later this week, possibly immediately, the BBC's Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg said.It has to be voted upon no later than 21 sitting days after its publication.Ministers have accepted the recommendations of a 2015 review into airport capacity in the south-east of England.This concluded that building a third runway at Heathrow offered the greatest economic benefits - as long as it was accompanied by a package of measures to address its environmental and community impacts.A draft national airports statement was approved by ministers in October setting out the conditions for its approval.Parliament must approve the revised statement, which has since been subject to a public consultation, to allow the planning process to move onto detailed work.Foreign Secretary Mr Johnson, who is MP for Uxbridge and Hillingdon in west London, has long been opposed to Heathrow expansion on both economic and environmental grounds and has vowed to ""lie down in front of bulldozers"" to prevent it.Other critics include former education secretary Justine Greening, who also represents a London constituency, and shadow chancellor John McDonnell. Analysis by Laura KuenssbergYes, the decades-long debate about airports in Britain is returning (it's never gone for long) just at a time when the government is embroiled in rows it will struggle to win. As one cabinet minister joked, ""it's the gift that keeps on giving"".However, with only Boris Johnson having big doubts around the cabinet table, the real rumpus will be in the Parliamentary Tory Party.Plenty of Tory MPs have long held objections to Heathrow and they will be made loudly on the backbenches in the weeks to come. The government doesn't have a majority and remember, it wants to get this plan through the Commons by the end of the month.If they can, it will be a demonstration of ""look, we are getting on with things, it's not just Brexit!""There will be howls, and the process even after this likely vote is a very long one. But the government can expect to get the vote through. Even if Labour opposes it, which it may well do on environmental grounds, the party is also split on the merits of the project so might not all vote together.Read the rest of the blogLabour has said expanded capacity is vital to the UK economy but its support is conditional on tests being met on capacity, climate change, noise and air quality as well as the wider economic benefits.Heathrow's owners say a new runway would cost £14bn and increase its capacity from 85.5 million to 130 million passengers. It is hoped it would be operational between 2025 and 2030. Campaigners argue a new runway will breach the UK's legal limits on air pollution but last year they failed in a bid to have the decision declared unlawful."
2018-06-04,Government U-turn on nuclear deal,https://web.archive.org//web/20180604234119/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-44363366,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe government has confirmed it is considering putting taxpayers' money into a project to build a new nuclear power station at Wylfa in North Wales. It's a decision that, if taken (and it almost certainly will be), will mark a significant U-turn in the government's approach to procuring new nuclear power.In 2010, the government was adamant that the UK public should never have to run the risk of lengthy and costly overruns that have become a hallmark of nuclear plant construction. In the case of Hinkley Point C in Somerset, the government made much of the fact that come what may, the UK taxpayer would be insulated from the skyrocketing costs that the contractor, EDF, had incurred on a similar plant in France.But there was a price to pay for that taxpayer protection: very expensive electricity. In return for shouldering all the risk, EDF demanded a price for the electricity that Hinkley will (one day) produce that is double the current going rate. The National Audit Office and the Public Accounts Committee were critical of that deal and there was considerable pressure to significantly reduce the cost of power from the Wylfa plant. It's expected it will come in around £77 per megawatt hour, compared to £92.50/MWh for Hinkley.Energy Secretary Greg Clark told the BBC: ""We listened to the NAO and PAC and thought it appropriate to explore a different way to deliver a project of this size.""Environmental groups condemned the deal. The Greens' Caroline Lucas said: ""Taking a stake in this nuclear monstrosity would see taxpayers locked into the project and paying out for a form of electricity generation that's not fit for the future.""However, Dieter Helm, professor of Energy Policy at the University of Oxford, told the BBC that the government shift made sense. ""The sheer cost of building new nuclear power stations means it makes sense for the government to help finance projects like this,"" he said. ""Governments can borrow much more cheaply that private companies and that lower cost of borrowing can drastically reduce the ultimate cost. Hinkley Point C would have been roughly half the cost if the government had been borrowing the money to build it at 2%, rather than EDF's cost of capital, which was 9%.""There is another reason why the government feels more comfortable taking a construction risk this time around. The Hinkley Point Project is based on a brand new reactor design which is yet to go into service anywhere in the world. By contrast, the Hitachi design is relatively tried and tested. Whatever the merits of the new approach, or the old design, the government can be sure to face tough questions as to why new nuclear construction is worth spending billions on when there are so many other calls on the Treasury coffers."

Ms Creasy wants the Offences against the Persons Act 1861 to be repealed, saying this would remove a block to abortion law reform in Northern Ireland.Her debate will not change the law but will give MPs a chance to air their views.Earlier Theresa May met Conservative MPs pressing for changes to Northern Ireland's abortion laws amid calls for an emergency debate on the issue.She met ex-ministers Amber Rudd, Maria Miller and Justine Greening, as well as women's minister Penny Mordaunt.By Gareth Gordon, BBC News NI political correspondentOn one hand, Theresa May's motivation for resisting calls to intervene to change Northern Ireland's abortion laws is obvious - for one thing she does not want to upset the Democratic Unionist Party apple cart.On the other, where will this apparent Conservative revolt (if that's what it is) end - and how big must it grow before she cannot resist it any longer?And then there is the DUP itself. It possesses the nuclear button of threatening to bring down the government. But press it and we could be looking at (in DUP terms) a post-apocalypse world in which the Labour party is in power and Jeremy Corbyn is prime minister.Read moreThe PM has so far resisted calls to act in Northern Ireland following last month's landslide vote in the Irish Republic to liberalise its own laws.No 10 says it should be dealt with by Stormont once devolution is restored.""We recognise there are strongly-held views on all sides of the debate in Northern Ireland and that's why our focus is on restoring that democratically accountable, devolved government,"" Downing Street said after the meeting.The Democratic Unionist Party, on whom Mrs May relies for her parliamentary majority, opposes changes to abortion law in Northern Ireland.On Monday its leader Arlene Foster said some nationalist voters backed its stance."

2018-06-04,Under-30s turn away from unions,https://web.archive.org//web/20180604234119/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-44346991,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe number of people under the age of 30 who are members of a trade union has fallen significantly since 2001.Figures from the Trades Union Congress provided to the BBC reveal membership levels among the under-30s have fallen from 20.1% in 2001 to 15.7% in 2017.In the private sector, which employs more than 80% of 21 to 30-year-olds, the figure fell from 12.6% to to 9%.It comes despite the pay gap between younger and older workers rising by more than half in the past 20 years.Younger people are also much more concerned about ""insecure work"" and their financial position.Frances O'Grady, the general secretary of the TUC, admitted the union movement had ""a problem"" in reaching young people.And it needed to show the under-30s that unions are still relevant in an era when higher-educated young people have actually seen average earnings drop over the last 20 years. On average, being a member of a union means your pay is higher - although that is often to do with the sector worked in and the size of the employer.A new report from the TUC to mark the 150th anniversary of its foundation in Manchester in 1868 revealed that over-30s are now paid 21.9% more than under-30s, compared with 14.5% in 1998.That means that on average, young people are earning £2.81 an hour less than older people, up from £1.51 an hour less in 1998.Although it would be expected that older people earn more than younger people, the slower pace of wage growth among the young has increased the gap.Older people are on average earning £5,884 a year more than younger workers, compared with £3,140 a year in 1998.Ms O'Grady said many young people felt they were in insecure employment in sectors such as health care or retail sales, but were not turning to the unions for support.Many employers also made it difficult for people to become a member of a union, she said.She also admitted that unions had to ""earn the right"" to represent people at work.""We know we've got a problem,"" Ms O'Grady told me.""We know that young people overwhelmingly are sympathetic to our vision and our values. The problem is that many of their employers, especially in the private sector, make it hard for us to organise them.""Of employees of all ages, 23.2% are a member of a union, itself the lowest figures since records of the percentage figure began in 1995.The overall membership of trade unions - at 6.9 million - is well below its peak above 13 million in the late 1970s.  ""If you think about where young people are working in hospitality or retail care industry, often on temporary or zero-hour contracts, often in franchise organisations that are hard to organise, the model that we have isn't working for them,"" Ms O'Grady said.""We've got to fix it, and we've got a chance, we're in the 21st Century, we can use 21st Century tools like digital to organise young people in new ways that suit them and give them what they need.""The TUC report revealed that younger people were now more concentrated in lower-paid sectors such as private social care or hotels and restaurants.A survey of 1,500 young people suggested that a quarter had struggled with living costs and that 41% had put off buying or moving home because of concern about finances.Just a third believed that their job made the best use of their skills.  ""What young people are telling us is that they feel stuck, they're stuck in low-paid insecure employment, they don't know how to get out or get on,"" Ms O'Grady said.""What they really want is an online shop steward, an online coach, who will support them in getting the skills and the opportunities they want to make a life for themselves.""She admitted the trades union movement needed to do more on diversity.""I want us to look like modern Britain, a little less of the male, pale and stale and a bit more of the diversity of Britain,"" Ms O'Grady said.""Our leadership looks a lot better than most of the leaderships you would find in the boardroom, or indeed in politics, but that's not good enough for me.""We've got to look like the people that we aim to represent - including young people.""

2018-06-04,MI5 to share information on terror suspects,https://web.archive.org//web/20180604234119/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44351841,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHome Secretary Sajid Javid has revealed plans for MI5 to declassify and share information on UK citizens suspected of having terrorist sympathies.""Key"" biographical data will be given to neighbourhood police, councils and the charity commission in London, Midlands and Manchester trial schemes. Last year's wave of terror attacks showed the need for wider and more local exchange of information, he said.There must be no ""safe spaces"" for terror suspects anywhere, he said. In his first speech on security since replacing Amber Rudd, Mr Javid said there had been a ""step change"" in the threat to the UK, with 25 Islamist-linked plots foiled in the last five years and four extreme right plots stopped since March 2017. To counter this, he called for increased - and faster - sharing of information between security services and the police as well as local authorities and other public agencies such as the Probation Service, the Charity Commission and the Communities department.The security services currently hold information on around 20,000 people labelled ""closed subjects of concern"" who have previously been investigated and it is believed could pose a threat in the future. Intelligence on up to a hundred of these could initially be shared. ""While it might seem self-evident today, it was not really happening before,"" he said.Examples of co-operation, he said, could lead to ""faster alerts for suspicious purchases, improving security at crowded places across the UK, and reducing the vulnerability of our critical infrastructure"".Ministers want firms to raise the alarm as quickly as possible if they have evidence of unusual transactions - such as someone stockpiling large amounts of chemicals or acting suspiciously when hiring a vehicle.The move reflects concern over a sharp reduction in the timeframe between the conception and execution of terror plots.Mr Javid said there must be ""no safe spaces in the UK for terrorists to spread their vile views, or for them to plan and carry out attacks and no safe spaces online for terrorist propaganda and technical expertise to be shared, and for people to be radicalised in a matter of weeks"".Other proposals include increasing maximum sentences for some offences and enhancing the use of data to track terrorism suspects. Mr Javid, who on Sunday confirmed the security services were to get 2,000 extra officers, also argued that the Islamic State group and right-wing extremists were ""more similar than they might like to think"".""They both exploit grievances, distort the truth, and undermine the values that hold us together,"" he said. It emerged over the weekend that security services expect the threat from Islamist terror to remain at its current heightened level of ""severe"" for at least another two years, while they assess that the risk from extreme right-wing terrorism as increasing.Security minister Ben Wallace told the BBC that classified information would be divulged where ""proportionate and necessary"" - as he said had once happened in Northern Ireland. The move was not aimed at ""hardened plotters"", he told BBC Radio 4's Today, but the ""large pool"" of people who might assist them in different ways, for instance by lending money.The BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner said the number of people being talked about was ""in the hundreds not the thousands"".While officials were adamant that early intervention could protect those potentially vulnerable to radicalisation, he said there was a risk that entirely innocent people could find themselves ""effectively blacklisted"". Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said there were 21,000 fewer police officers than when the Conservatives came to power and also questioned the involvement of councils, which she said had not been mentioned in former watchdog David Anderson's report into last year's attacks in London and Manchester. Councils said they already played a role in reporting early signs of radicalisation but their staff could not be expected to do the jobs of intelligence experts or police officers. ""Information sharing could be a positive step,"" said Simon Blackburn, from the Local Government Association.""But local authorities are not MI5 and it's essential that the police and security services lead on responding to and acting on any threats.""Ministers have also responded to reports that dozens of terrorists are set to be released from prison after completing their sentences within the next few months, saying they are a ""concern"".

I directly addressed the need to work for reconciliation even when it makes us uncomfortable and regardless of what others say or do, that’s what I will do this year.End of Twitter post  by @EmmetMcDBMr McDonough-Brown replaces Ulster Unionist councillor Sonia Copeland.First elected to council in 2011, Ms Hargey insisted the controversy over her being in Magennis's bar on the night Robert McCartney was murdered in 2005 will not overshadow her tenure.Speaking after Monday's council meeting Ms Hargey said the family deserved justice.""I have cooperated fully in all cases with regards to this investigation and I would continue to do so if that was required of me in the time ahead,"" she said.The decision to nominate Deirdre Hargey points to a wider effort on Sinn Féin's part to promote women within the party. With the party now fronted by Mary-Lou McDonald and Michelle O'Neill, the selection of Ms Hargey is a ""natural choice"", according to the Andersonstown News columnist Andrée Murphy.The fact that Ms Hargey comes to the role as the party's most recent council group leader is a strategic move, she added.""The role of lord mayor now has more importance given the lack of a Stormont assembly."""

French President Emmanuel Macron has called Mr Trump to tell him the tariffs were ""illegal"", while Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said the US move is ""totally unacceptable"".The EU, Mexico and Canada have all set out plans for retaliatory tariffs on US goods.At the weekend, China - which is not directly impacted by last week's announcement - warned that all trade talks between Beijing and Washington would be void if the US sets up trade sanctions.Despite the chorus of criticism, Mr Trump appeared in no mood for compromise. On Saturday, the president tweeted that the US had been ""ripped off by other countries for years on trade"".He says steel tariffs will protect US steelmakers, which he says are vital to national security. Mr Trump has also complained about barriers US firms face in Europe and elsewhere.""Time to get smart!"" he added.Canada, Mexico and the EU combined exported $23bn worth of steel and aluminium to the US in 2017 - nearly half of the $48bn of total steel and aluminium imports last year.The EU has responded to the US announcement with a 10-page list of tariffs on US goods ranging from Harley-Davidson motorcycles to bourbon.Canada plans to impose tariffs of up to 25% on about $13bn worth of US exports from 1 July. Goods affected will include some American steel, as well as consumer products such as yoghurt, whiskey and coffee."

Ukip supporter Hall sent the emails last December, in the wake of a Brexit debate in parliament, the court heard. One email, littered with capital letters and exclamation marks, was sent by Hall to four of the MPs after a parliamentary vote on an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill.It had in the subject line: ""Your back stabbing treachery"" and read: ""You deserve to be HUNG for your attack on our democracy yesterday.""The email concluded, in capitals: ""May you burn in hell for eternity.""Prosecutor Matthew Brook said an email to Wolverhampton MP Eleanor Smith was sent after she made comments about the Black Country flag.Mr Lammy and Ms Morgan attended court to give evidence against Hall when he entered his guilty pleas.Speaking outside court Ms Morgan, Conservative MP for Loughborough, said: ""MPs are of course subject to robust debate and scrutiny, which is what we should be.""When things tip over into threats of violence or death, then I think a line has been crossed."""

Ministers have reportedly been at odds over whether military veterans will be offered enough protection.The idea of a statute of limitations - also referred to as an ""amnesty"" - has been opposed by Sinn Fein, while DUP leader Arlene Foster has also expressed reservations.Speaking on BBC Radio 5 live's Pienaar's Politics, Mr Ellwood said he ""knocked over a few milk bottles"" during his Army days when he served in Northern Ireland.""I don't want somebody knocking on my door, I don't want anybody knocking, asking for any members of my platoon that I served with, to ask questions of something that happened so many years ago,"" he said.""But I also reflect on where things are with the border that I then witnessed, I would not want to see us go back to any form of that situation, so we must resolve this situation.""Asked whether a statute of limitations should be included, he said: ""There's a consultation, I personally would like to see this considered - but it's not for me to make that judgement.""He added: ""It does make sense to draw a line at some point to say that investigations have taken place to their conclusion and unless there's compelling evidence put forward to a very high court...we then close the books on that particular matter.""However, there is a consultation taking place, these arguments I think will be put into that consultation and I hope common sense will then prevail.""At the moment you are hearing of the historic allegations team, this Northern Ireland operation, knocking on doors of people who are now in their eighties asking for questions.""That cannot be how we should look after our veterans."""

Suggest that to the government and it would push back pretty strongly, even if some ministers might raise an eyebrow while doing so. But next Tuesday isn't going to be like that at all with a marathon session of Brexit business back in the Commons. The Lords beat the government fifteen times on its EU Withdrawal Bill, forcing changes to ministers' plans. The government will try to unpick those alterations. So while it's hard to know precisely how many votes there will be, there will be a lot, and it is certainly unusual to have them all in one day. The bill passed its first hurdle in the Commons a few months ago, but the House of Lords then made plenty of nips and tucks, or amendments, on how customs should work after Brexit, on the Irish border, on whether we should stay in a different free trade area, the EEA, and plenty of other issues besides.What the government wants is to undo the changes the Lords made to the bill.But it is far from clear that they can rely on the votes in the Commons to do so. For many weeks potential Tory rebels who want a closer relationship with the EU after Brexit, have been planning how they might vote - this could be the moment then they gang together to beat the government. They are confident that they could do so if they choose to, one of them said to me today, ""some of us just are starting to think we have to fill in the gaps"" trying to force the prime minister's hand to make up for what some see as the absence of leadership, saying No 10 has an ""untenable lack of strategy, and it's running out of road"".Whether in the end they have the guts to do so next Tuesday, there's already a row. After months of a relatively quiet Parliament, trying to ram 15 votes through on the bill in one day is not exactly giving MPs time and space for debate. Some around here are crying foul already. Surely the whips aren't trying to squeeze out dissent in the Remain camp?  Perish the thought. But it's worth noting on the Eurosceptic side there's satisfaction that the bill is at last returning to the Commons, and the votes all take place in one day - ""bish bash bosh"" - as one source described it.There's the possibility that the bill, with losses or victories for the government will speed straight back to the lords within days. Next week there certainly will not be the case that ""there's nothing happening"".PS: While Parliament is going to sound very divided in the next ten days, if you have been following the Customs debate in particular - which I know I have probably written about far too much - there is a sense, not of an answer, but of a developing compromise. Two Cabinet ministers have told me now that they expect the prime minister to end up in a position where she plumps for the revised 'max fac' proposal, but has to admit it won't be ready for years. One of them today suggested the most likely outcome would be to move to a new 'Customs Partnership' at the end of the Brexit Implementation Period, then to 'max fac' once the technology has been developed in years to come. What Brussels will make of it is a different question. And with the Brexit White Paper possibly delayed until after the June summit, it is possible that the government still doesn't come up with its solution on this until July. PPS: If that's one compromise, here's another potential one. Open Europe, the think tank that is officially neutral but that has close links to Eurosceptics has published a paper putting forward a possible compromise for the future economic relationship with the EU. In essence, the UK would stay closely tied to the EU in terms of goods, but go our own way on services. Nothing about this is easy, and again, Brussels has always pushed back at the idea of splitting up any sectors. But it has gathered quite a bit of attention and support around Westminster, and it's worth a read. Click here to read it.  "

Hospitals have bust their budgets by record amounts. And there has been the first all-out strike by doctors. But despite all this, Jeremy Hunt has remained as health secretary in England.With five years and 274 days under his belt, he is the longest-serving custodian of the NHS, having surpassed Margaret Thatcher's Health Minister, Norman Fowler, and Aneurin Bevan, the man who set up the health service in the first place. How has he survived so long?To understand Mr Hunt's reign, you need to go back to the start. He was appointed, in September 2012, because he was seen as a skilled communicator who could help articulate a clear vision for the health service after the furore over the changes implemented by his predecessor, Andrew Lansley.Mr Hunt immediately took a different tack - and it is one that has come to shape his time as health secretary. One of his first moves as health secretary was to go on holiday with his family. It had already been booked, following the London Olympics and a tricky period as culture secretary during which he had become embroiled in row over his relationship with Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.While on holiday, he read the report into the Stafford Hospital scandal, which Sir Robert Francis had just finished. Those close to him said the findings had horrified him. It was not just the poor care and suffering that had happened, but that it had been allowed to go on so long without the alarm being raised.He came back convinced he needed to champion patient safety. In the following years, he went on to overhaul the inspection regime, introduce a new duty of candour on staff and fresh rules about whistle-blowers.Someone working with him at the time told me this was ""classic Jeremy"". They said: ""He likes to pick a central theme and focus on it relentlessly. It is how he believes you get things done in government.""In the speeches I've heard over the years, he runs through the stories of those who have suffered. People such as:It is powerful stuff. These are the very worst examples of NHS care. They should never have happened. And only his harshest critics would disagree with what he says about them. Mr Titcombe has said the health secretary's efforts should be applauded. He believes he has ""changed the game when it comes to patient safety"".""I watched my son die. And then I watched the NHS close ranks afterwards,"" Mr Titcombe said. ""[Mr Hunt] was [one of] the few people who listened. And he took action.""But what has annoyed many who work in the NHS is the way he has gone about tackling the problem. They feel he has blamed them and questioned their professionalism at a time when his government has overseen the toughest funding settlement the NHS has ever had.Nowhere is this clearer than in his handling of the junior-doctor contract row. Emboldened by the election victory in 2015, Mr Hunt returned to office determined to achieve the manifesto commitment of creating a seven-day NHS and - as a result, he argued - safer care for patients.He was markedly more aggressive than he had been in his first two and a half years in post. He criticised what he said was a ""Monday to Friday"" culture, prompting an outpouring of anger. On social media, medics started posing photographs of themselves at work using the hashtag #ImInWorkJeremy.The clash set the tone for a difficult few months for the health secretary. Contract negotiations with junior doctors had already started and stalled. And the stalemate soon worsened, with the British Medical Association balloting for industrial action. After months of wrangling, junior doctors took part in a series of walkouts, two of which involved all-out strikes where emergency care was not covered - the first time that had ever happened in the NHS.Mr Hunt acknowledges this was his most difficult time as health secretary. And while he remains unapologetic for taking on the BMA, which he says was spreading misinformation about the contract, he accepts he should have done more to tackle one major complaint of doctors - rota gaps.Since the dispute, he has announced increases in training places for both doctors and nurses. Following the strikes, Mr Hunt's approval rating actually dropped lower than predecessor Andrew Lansley's had at the height of his troubles.And by the time Theresa May became prime minister, in the summer of 2016, there was strong speculation that he was going to lose his job.In fact, on the morning of her first reshuffle, there were reports he had actually been sacked but then reinstated when it had become clear not all the people Ms May had earmarked for posts in her first cabinet had been willing to take up the offer.This has been denied by Mr Hunt and his team - and certainly the health secretary had the last laugh by tweeting on the day: ""Reports of my death have been greatly exaggerated."" The mere fact he has survived so long in one of the most demanding posts in government means speculation about his future is a given. Ahead of the last election, reports surfaced that Ben Gummer, who has served as a junior minister under Mr Hunt, had been earmarked as the next health secretary.But Mr Gummer lost his seat. And, with Theresa May left weakened following the election, there was limited change in the cabinet. Indeed, some began to see Mr Hunt's longevity as a benefit to the government during a period when NHS waiting times have worsened and attracted negative headlines.Norman Lamb, a former Liberal Democrat health spokesman and a minister in the coalition, once described him as the ""shock absorber"", able to take the flak for the government.But as he has gone on and with the NHS in its 70th year, there is a sense attitudes towards Mr Hunt have begun to change again.At the last reshuffle, in the winter, it is understood he was offered the job of business secretary but this time had the confidence to tell the prime minister he wanted to stay where he was.Even among his critics, this news was met with a grudging acceptance. There is, it seems, a growing feeling - even among those who have wished him out in the past - that it is better to have someone in post who understands the health service and has the power to argue for it at the cabinet table than a newcomer.Behind the scenes, Mr Hunt was championing the need for a long-term funding settlement in late 2017 - and the fact that the prime minister has now committed to that is in large part down to his influence.Discussions about how big a rise the NHS should receive continue. But by all accounts Mr Hunt is pushing back against the Treasury, which seems to want to offer only an extra 2% a year when economists are arguing it will need to be nearer 4% if the NHS is to remain in good health.How he fares in those discussions could well shape his legacy as health secretary.Read more from NickFollow Nick on Twitter"

Respondents were asked to complete a detailed online questionnaire on identity and belonging.

People have a sense that no-one is talking about the people outside the capital. In the EU referendum, the Leave campaign's slogan 'take back control' cut through for that reason.""Nearly three quarters of over-65s  are proud to be English compared with fewer than half of those aged 18 to 24.Mr Denham said: ""Young people will tend to be less patriotic than older people wherever they are, whether that's England, Scotland or Wales.""They will have a more cosmopolitan view of the world. And in the younger generation there are more people from black and minority ethnic groups who are more likely to identify as British than as English.""It doesn't mean that Englishness and English pride is disappearing, but we are looking at a future where both Britishness and Englishness will mean a lot to a lot of people.""Being born in England makes someone English according to eight out of 10 people surveyed.Living in England for less than five years qualifies someone as English in the minds of just 14% of those who responded.For just over a third of people (38%) considering yourself English is enough and trumps even living in England for 10 or more years or even being able to speak English.A sense of humour, tradition, manners and fair play are characteristics most people surveyed associate with being English.Although more than half of respondents consider strongly that generosity and plain-speaking were part of the English identity, less than half think the English are a liberal, outward-looking people. And less than four in 10 consider Englishness to be defined by ""yob culture"". Only one in four consider the English to be a ""loud"" people.""So-called yob culture is not such a dominant image of Englishness as some people think,"" said Mr Denham.""If you see footage of English football fans smashing up a town square, you're going to think about yob culture at the time, but most people associate Englishness with much more positive values most of the time.

The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 1%.The council level estimates shown in the search box above are based on the poll and a statistical procedure called multilevel regression and post-stratification or MRP. The technique produces estimates for small areas based on a limited amount of data. It uses the people from each local authority to predict that area's results, but to ensure that this small amount of data is representative of the wider population the estimates are balanced out using comparable data from the poll from the rest of the country and the census on the demographic make-up of the local authority in question. As with all models the figures are subject to uncertainty. The analysis was run by Dr Kevin Cunningham working with Dr Ian Warren of @ElectionData. More details on MRP are available from YouGov."

""We've been left in limbo,"" says Fiona Godfrey, a freelance legal consultant living with her family in Luxembourg who also volunteers with the pressure group British in Europe. ""I think it's shameful. We should never ever have been put in this position."" The dilemma is that what has been agreed so far between the UK government and the EU - in the Withdrawal Agreement they are negotiating - will only give British citizens the right to live and work in the country where they reside. In Fiona's case, that means tiny Luxembourg. But at the moment she works in other countries every week, relying on her rights of freedom of movement within the EU single market. ""In 20 years I've worked in every EU member state, plus Norway and Switzerland,"" she says. ""We want to keep the rights we have - we need to keep our free movement, we need to keep our rights to work, and we need to keep recognition of our professional qualifications, because that is another huge issue.""Some UK citizens in the EU will be able to continue to work as they do now. If, for example, you are defined as a frontier worker - crossing a border on a regular basis for a nine-to-five job on a regular employment contract - then you should be OK. But if you are defined as a cross-border supplier of services there is no guarantee as yet that you'll be able to work after Brexit as you do now.  New restrictions could apply to all sorts of people:  lawyers, architects, truckers… or freelance chefs cooking for hungry skiers in the French Alps.""It's been very stressful. Nearly two years now, and we still have no clarity on what is going to happen and how we are going to be affected,"" says Helen Malaburn, speaking from her home near Les Trois Vallees in France. She and her husband have lived there for 10 years, cooking for tourists and local residents during the winter ski season. But in the summer, the work dries up, and they spend their time working in places like Greece and Spain. ""At the moment, we do approximately half of our work outside France,"" Helen says. ""There's no way we could sustain ourselves on the winter work that we do.""""We're completely dependent on being able to work across the EU, and having our qualifications (as chefs) recognised in every country, like they are now."" Helen and Fiona are not alone. The debate about UK citizens living in the EU often focuses on pensioners seeking warmer weather - and they certainly have concerns of their own. But roughly 80% of the one million or so Brits in the EU are of working age or younger.There is a lack of clarity on a number of other issues that concern them. It is still not clear, for example, whether UK citizens in the EU will have access to university education on the same financial terms as they do now; nor whether - as part of a bureaucratic process - they will have to make new applications to remain in the countries where they live. One solution to the dilemma facing so many people is to apply for dual citizenship. Both Helen and Fiona are in the process of doing so, as are many of their British counterparts. But it's not an option available in every country - Austria and the Netherlands, for example, don't allow it and other countries have some restrictions. Nor is there a guarantee of success, and the application process takes time. And that is the one thing that is now in short supply. The European Parliament has promised to take a tough line on protecting citizens' rights, and the Dutch MEP Sophie in 't Veld is critical of both sides in the Brexit negotiations.  ""They're making it into a legalistic issue,"" she says, ""but this is about the fundamental rights of people who have set up their lives here in Europe and are counting on free movement.""So this is a condition for the European Parliament to give its consent to the Withdrawal Agreement.""Does she think the European Parliament would otherwise struggle to approve the agreement (which it has to do before Brexit happens)? ""Yes. We have adopted a series of resolutions where we set out our conditions for giving consent, and this is one of them.""So when can UK citizens expect their concerns to be addressed? The EU says the whole notion of ""mobility of citizens"" will be part of negotiations on the future relationship between the UK and the EU. But those talks have barely begun, and they won't be concluded by the time Brexit is due to take place in ten months' time. The fear is that ""mobility of citizens"" would then get caught up in haggling over all sorts of other issues in negotiations on a future free trade agreement. It wouldn't be a comfortable place to be. ""I don't feel like a bargaining chip, I am a bargaining chip, and I shouldn't be,"" says Fiona Godfrey. On behalf of British in Europe, she has this appeal for Theresa May: ""Write to the member states, write to (Michel) Barnier, and say we would like British citizens to have continuing free movement. ""We think it is a deal that can be done if she just makes the request.""The proposed 21-month transition (or implementation) period after Brexit gives everyone involved a bit of breathing space, but time to include a deal on future free movement in the Withdrawal Agreement is fast running out. So does the government think that is still a possibility? In a written statement, the Department for Exiting the European Union, said: ""We've reached a reciprocal deal for our citizens during the implementation period that recognises the valuable contribution that EU citizens make to the UK, and that UK citizens make to the EU.""The issue of onward movement rights for UK citizens in the EU has not been forgotten and we will raise this in the next phase of negotiations.""The UK will seek to reach a final deal that is in the mutual interest of citizens living across the continent.""But no-one knows when that final deal on the future relationship will be agreed. And the concern among many UK citizens in the EU is that they will have no certainty about their future status, and their ability to work as they do now, until after the UK has left.Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questionsFollow us on Twitter"

She has a death stare which makes Gordon Brown look, by comparison, like the kind of prime minister who'd be dead-legged by a nine-year-old in a school playground. But is she as tough as she looks? Or is Mrs May merely stubborn? And cautious? And rather indecisive?For a prime minister who has - or at least, once had - a reputation for strength, Theresa May's now spending a surprising amount of time being urged behind closed doors in Downing Street to stand up, and face down, the hard-line Brexiteers in her own party. A stream of Tory MPs have been urging Mrs May to defy the hard-line Brexiteers for the sake of striking compromises to achieve what they're calling a sensible Brexit. Three former Cabinet ministers were the latest through the door. Amber Rudd, Justine Greening and her former deputy Damian Green.Green told me, in an interview for BBC Radio 4's World at One: ""There's a danger of assuming that those who shout the loudest represent the most and I think there is a silent majority within the parliamentary party that wants Brexit, that accepts that Brexit is going to happen, but wants it to be a pragmatic and sensible Brexit that means, above all, there's no disruption if we can achieve that.""What, then, about the whispered threat among Brexiteers that Mrs May might face a vote of no confidence, if she strays too far from the Brexit straight and narrow? Was he sure she'd win?""Certainly that, but I think even before that, the vast majority of my colleagues, even those who have been very strongly campaigning for Brexit, recognise that this is absolutely not the time to do that sort of thing.""So what might a so-called sensible Brexit look like? While Cabinet ministers search for agreement on Britain's future customs relationship with the EU - a search which, I'm hearing, is getting nowhere fast - attention's focussing on getting Brussels to agree to the fall-back plan of extending a customs deal until new trade deals are struck, and ensuring British borders have the staff and high-tech equipment to cope.Meanwhile, at Westminster, there is more talk among Tory MPs than many people suppose about perhaps extending some form of single market relationship at the same time.The former head of Theresa May's Policy Board, ex-minister George Freeman, certainly thinks so. And look closely for a phrase which seems to have become fashionable.""The silent majority of the Conservative parliamentary party want the prime minister, and support the prime minister in negotiating a deal where we have as frictionless and as cost-free access to the European market as we can negotiate, and the freedom to do our own deals with the emerging economies,"" he told me.""The mood in the parliamentary party is that the balance of probability falls in terms of staying with our existing market, and the burden of proof falls with those emerging trade deals. If we see them and begin to see what they could be worth then the mood shifts. But right now the vast majority of Conservative MPs want to deliver a prosperity Brexit."" Maybe so, but getting even broad agreement among MPs would be tough.  Getting agreement in Brussels, maybe tougher still.And there's a view among senior Tories that it would take a parliamentary defeat at the hands of Tory rebels and Labour opponents to force Theresa May's hand. Or untie them, depending on your point of view.The Tory rebels' unofficial chief whip in the Commons is Stephen Hammond. Were the rebels who are threatening to vote to stay in the EU Customs Union holding firm? Ready to defeat the Government? The answer was ""yes... if forced"".""But we're a long way away from that. I am trying to work with the government, as a number of others are, to make sure that we can get what the prime minister wants, which is frictionless trade. We need to start concentrating on the interests of British industry. And therefore if in the short term, we need a longer period in the customs union to sort out our new customs arrangements, that's what the government should do,"" he said.Committed, convinced, Brexiteers insist enough compromises have already been made. Peter Bone doesn't shout. He's quite softly spoken. But still manages to make himself clear.""There have been lots and lots of compromises by people who believe in Brexit to keep everyone together,"" he said.""But there are certain things that we've compromised enough on to get agreement and we really can't go any further on those. We shouldn't be listening to people who shout the loudest, we should be talking to everyone and trying to create an agreement that everyone can support. But that has to be based on what the British people voted for.""To state the obvious, Brexit's a struggle. With Brussels. In the Tory party. And remember the wrangling in the Labour Party will be every bit as crucial to the outcome - whatever that may be.But just now, the silent majority in the Tory party, if that's what they are, are keen to give a new meaning to the Brexiteer's favourite slogan. The one about ""Taking back control""."
2018-06-04,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20180604234119/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks  have now moved on to future relations - after agreement was reached on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are just beginning. Both sides hope they can agree within six months on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all.  Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide, but first let's go back to the basics...It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro.Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.5%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand near a 40-year year low of 4.3%. Annual house price increases have fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 4.9% in the year to January 2018, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May is seeking to put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. If passed, it will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, is supposed to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said continued membership of the single market has to be an option in negotiations with Brussels.   Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The single market is a very different beast - it is not just about the trade in goods. It allows the free movement of people, money and services as if the EU was a single country.Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each playing roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border check for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanAn agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement.The full details are not yet known but UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72.We don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pounds buy fewer euros. A slump in the value of the dollar means the exchange rate with the pound is pretty close to where it was before the referendum.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.A method for calculating the bill has been agreed, but the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more.The question of how and when payments will be made still needs to resolved, but it will be a schedule lasting for many years to come, and it is highly unlikely that anyone will ever be able to give an exact figure for the size of the divorce bill.UK sources say it will be up to £40bn, but some EU sources expect it to be higher than that. No-one can say for sure, and both sides want to keep it that way.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 6.5% in 2016 to 2.7% in 2017, according to the Halifax. It said the slowdown was driven by a squeeze on real wage growth.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-06-04,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180604234119/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to £840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

As I write, Mrs May is holed up with her advisers inside Tory HQ. But a former minister Anna Soubry has called for her to ""consider her position"" - political code for calling for her to resign. Read more from LauraJohn Curtice, Professor of Politics at the University of StrathclydeThis is the third post-war snap election called unexpectedly before a party's term of office had come to an end.  On the two previous occasions in 1970 and February 1974 the PM and the party lost office. While there is no other conceivable administration in the new parliament other than a Conservative-led one, it remains to be seen whether the PM will retain her position. However, so long as the Conservatives can reach an accommodation with the DUP they will have a working majority in the House of Commons.  BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed:When the general election exit poll was revealed at 10pm, the pound immediately dropped by 2% as investors took a position that a hung parliament was a possible outcome of the general election.Why would that cause the currency to decline? Because a hung parliament means that the government's direction of travel would be less certain.

But her fellow Tory MP Maria Caulfield accused campaigners of telling women in Northern Ireland ""that the women in Westminster know best"", saying their campaign ""flies in the face of women's rights and women's choices"".Thank you to all MPs who took part in todays debate.With authority comes responsibility.Message from NI Secretary of State today: NI should take that responsibility.Message from the House of Commons: if you don't, we will.#trustwomenEnd of Twitter post  by @PennyMordauntAfter the debate, Equalities Minister Penny Mordaunt said MPs had sent a message to Northern Ireland's politicians that if they did not act, ""we will"".Following last month's Irish referendum result, Northern Ireland will soon be the only part of either the UK or Ireland where abortion is illegal unless there is a serious risk to a woman's life or health.Labour MP Stella Creasy is leading calls for parts of the 1861 Offences Against the Person Act - the legislation that still governs abortion in Northern Ireland - to be repealed.In 1967, the 1861 act was amended so abortions were legal in England and Wales - but this was not extended to Northern Ireland.Ms Bradley said there were clearly a range of views on the issue.But abortion had ""long been devolved"" she said, and ""it would not be appropriate for Westminster to seek to impose its will"" on Northern Ireland.""Personally I want to see reform in Northern Ireland - but it is a matter for the people of Northern Ireland,"" she said, adding that if the matter came before the House of Commons it would be a ""free vote"" with MPs able to vote with their conscience.Ms Bradley said Ireland's referendum was ""specific to Ireland"" and there were ""significant differences"" with the situation in Northern Ireland.But setting out her case, Ms Creasy - who was backed by MPs from other parties - said the ""impact"" of last month's referendum had been the trigger for the debate.By Gareth Gordon, BBC News NI political correspondentOn one hand, Theresa May's motivation for resisting calls to intervene to change Northern Ireland's abortion laws is obvious - for one thing she does not want to upset the Democratic Unionist Party apple cart.On the other, where will this apparent Conservative revolt (if that's what it is) end - and how big must it grow before she cannot resist it any longer?And then there is the DUP itself. It possesses the ""nuclear button"" of threatening to bring down the government. But press it and we could be looking at (in DUP terms) a post-apocalypse world in which the Labour Party is in power and Jeremy Corbyn is prime minister.Read moreThe Walthamstow MP said: ""150 years is a long time to wait for social justice,"" adding: ""Men and women will never truly be free whilst one cannot control what happens to their own body.""She said she had received abuse online for her campaign, calling her a ""disgrace to humanity"".""Frankly, women get the blame whatever we do in these situations.""Ms Creasy called for the government to offer a date for a vote to test the will of the Commons on the subject.The DUP's Ian Paisley said her proposal would create a ""massive hole"" in the law in Northern Ireland and not allow doctors the right to conscientious objections against abortion.And another DUP MP, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, said law and policy should ""affirm and uphold"" the rights of both mothers and unborn children, paying tribute to Sinn Fein politicians who shared his anti-abortion stance and saying it was ""nonsense"" to say his party was alone in its view.""It is for the people of Northern Ireland through the Northern Ireland Assembly to decide what the law on abortion should be,"" he added.Sinn Fein vice president Michelle O'Neill welcomed the Westminster debate, describing it as a ""first step"" on the road to abortion reform in Northern Ireland."
2018-06-05,Cabinet approves new Heathrow runway,https://web.archive.org//web/20180606004110/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44357580,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowMinisters have described their backing for a new runway at Heathrow Airport as an ""historic moment"" for the UK. The cabinet signed off the plans after they were approved by the government's economic sub-committee, which is chaired by Prime Minister Theresa May.Transport Secretary Chris Grayling announced £2.6bn in compensation for residents and noise abatement measures.Environmental groups oppose the plan, which Mr Grayling says will only happen if air quality commitments are met. ""The time for action is now,"" Mr Grayling told MPs, who will be asked to vote on the expansion plan by 11 July. He insisted the decision was being taken in the national interest and would benefit the whole of the UK - with 15% of new landing slots at the airport ""facilitating"" regional connectivity.He said the £14bn runway, which could be completed by 2026, would be funded entirely privately - but MPs warned that taxpayers would end up footing the bill for billions in road improvements and other upgrades and warned that the UK's carbon emission targets would be threatened by the increase in traffic around the enlarged airport. A decision - finally?The debate on expanding Heathrow has been going on for nearly 20 years. The last Labour government backed the idea, and won a vote on it in 2009, but that plan was scrapped - and the idea of expansion put on hold for five years - by the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition formed after the 2010 election. But the idea of expansion was resurrected and has been subsequently backed by the Conservatives. Ministers approved a draft national airports policy statement in October but Parliament has yet to give its approval for detailed planning to begin. Opponents have threatened a legal challenge while Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, who is MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip in west London, has vowed to ""lie down in front of bulldozers"" to prevent it.The BBC's assistant political editor Norman Smith said ministers whose constituencies would be directly affected might be given a ""get out of a jail card"" - by being allowed to miss the vote or even vote against. No 10 said Mrs May has written to ministers to say those with long-standing objections to a third runway will be permitted to restate their views at a local level, but not to campaign actively against the decision. 'So expensive': Why are critics opposed?Campaigners argue that a new runway will breach the UK's legal limits on air pollution and increase noise pollution with an extra 700 planes a day. It will result in huge disruption to residents of nearby villages, such as Longford, Harmondsworth and Sipson, with hundreds of homes likely to be knocked down. Robert Barnstone, from the No 3rd Runway Coalition, told the BBC it was a ""disappointing"" day and the government was ""failing people and failing the environment as well"". Former Transport Secretary Justine Greening, who backs expanding Gatwick instead, suggested the idea of Heathrow as a national hub airport was outdated and the focus should be on improving regional capacity.""We are now moving to point-to-point travel,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today. ""Why should people who are living in Newcastle spend hours travelling down to London, then fly out somewhere else?""There is nothing national about this national policy statement. It is just a runway in Heathrow.""And Tory MP Zac Goldsmith, who resigned his Richmond Park seat in 2016 over the issue and subsequently lost a by-election, said for many people ""this doesn't just look like a blank cheque being given by this government to a foreign-owned multinational, it looks like a whole book of cheques signed by our constituents"".'Right for UK PLC'Heathrow's owners, which include Spanish infrastructure firm Ferrovial, say the airport is virtually full and a new runway would increase its capacity from 85.5 million to 130 million passengers. The expansion is estimated to create about 60,000 new jobs and generate about £70bn in total economic benefits by the 2050s. Mr Grayling said it would provide a ""vital legacy"" for the British economy and said he had accepted 24 out of the 25 recommendations made by the Transport Select Committee to improve the plans.Residents whose houses are knocked down will get compensation worth 125% of their value - as well as legal fees and stamp duty costs paid for - while £700m would be available to fund noise insulation measures for those who decide to stay.He said a ban on night flights was an ""absolute requirement"" and non-negotiable while he said landing charges paid by airlines must stay at current levels.""This runway cannot be built if it does not meet air quality rules,"" he added.Sir Howard Davies, whose 2015 review recommended a new runway as long as environmental and community impacts were addressed, said ""significant"" concessions had been made on reducing early morning flights and minimising the impact on residents on the proposed flight path.The political battle - by Laura Kuenssberg, BBC political editorYes, the decades-long debate about airports in Britain is returning (it's never gone for long) just at a time when the government is embroiled in rows it will struggle to win. As one cabinet minister joked, ""it's the gift that keeps on giving"".However, with only Boris Johnson having big doubts around the cabinet table, the real rumpus will be in the Parliamentary Tory Party.Plenty of Tory MPs have long held objections to Heathrow and they will be made loudly on the backbenches in the weeks to come. The government doesn't have a majority and remember, it wants to get this plan through the Commons by the end of the month.If they can, it will be a demonstration of ""look, we are getting on with things, it's not just Brexit!""There will be howls, and the process even after this likely vote is a very long one. But the government can expect to get the vote through. Even if Labour opposes it, which it may well do on environmental grounds, the party is also split on the merits of the project so might not all vote together.Read the rest of the blogLabour and the SNP save the day?Labour has said expanded capacity is vital to the UK economy but its support is conditional on tests being met on capacity, climate change, noise and air quality, as well as the wider economic benefits.But there is also a split in opinion when it comes to individual MPs, with shadow chancellor John McDonnell - whose Hayes and Harlington constituency could see homes demolished - says he is ""implacably opposed"". Shadow Transport Secretary Andy McDonald said his party would ""follow the evidence"" and not simply rely on assurances from Mr Grayling: ""If the correct balance is not found then the courts will rightly intervene,"" he said.Leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""Yes, there is a demand for increased airport capacity across the south east, two of the south east airports are working somewhat under capacity, Stansted and Luton. Gatwick and Heathrow are working at pretty well max capacity, let's look at it in that context."" The SNP's Alan Brown said the new runway had the support of the Scottish government, most Scottish airports and Scottish firms who recognised the ""business benefits"". But Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable said the plans were an ""expensive folly"" and his party's 12 MPs would work with others to ""put an end to this project once and for all"". And The Green Party's MP Caroline Lucas said it was a ""disastrous decision"" which ""flew in the face of common sense and climate science"". The carbon questionAs one would expect, there have been contrasting reactions from business and environmental groups.The Institute of Directors said the end of arguments over Heathrow's future was within ""touching distance"".""While the new runway is being built, we also need to make better use of capacity at existing airports in the South East, and indeed the rest of the country,"" said its director general Stephen Martin. But Friends of The Earth said a new runway was not compatible with building a low-carbon economy.""Heathrow expansion would be bad news for our climate and will bring more noise, air pollution and misery to local residents,"" said the organisation's Jenny Bates.

Mr Ghosh has also insisted he is not Islamophobic.Mr Amin also criticised the unsuccessful London mayoral campaign of Zac Goldsmith, who attempted to link his Labour rival Sadiq Khan to Islamist extremists.He said he had been a Conservative member for 35 years and did not want to ""rock the boat"" but: ""The Conservative Muslim Forum decided unanimously that the matter was so serious that we should actually make our position known publicly.""The Conservative hierarchy had ""wished the issue would go away"" rather than deal with it, he said, adding that while the party was not anti-Muslim it had ""given excessive priority to electoral consideration rather than taking decisive action"".He also drew parallels with complaints about anti-Semitism in Labour ranks, warning of parties becoming ""identified by racial or religious lines"".""There are bad eggs in all parties but you don't get the same bad eggs in every party,"" he added."

""The argument is that without some ambition the USO itself may become a constraint on all these important challenges,"" he said.Liberal Democrat Lord Foster of Bath said the current plans would see a continuation of the ""digital divide"".Conservative backbenchers also expressed frustration, with Earl Cathcart complaining about the ""appalling"" speeds he receives at his home in Norfolk.He told of being unable to download a Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs report. He added: ""So I have to ring up my agent in Norwich, get him to print it out and send it to me in the post.""That's hardly 21st Century communications, but at least the post is reliable.""In the same debate, crossbencher the Earl of Lytton  called for a ban on using the term ""up to"" in advertised internet speeds, labelling them ""a smokescreen of the first order"" that allowed providers ""to conceal poor performance"".Digital minister Lord Ashton of Hyde said: ""The USO has an important part to play in ensuring that no-one is left behind,"" and the present minimum specification was being kept under review."

2018-06-05,Could Cummings really be summoned by MPs?,https://web.archive.org//web/20180606004110/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-parliaments-44374606,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAppropriately enough for the committee which oversees the gambling industry, they're rolling the dice. In a terse 18-paragraph report the Commons Digital, Culture Media and Sport Committee has announced it intends to put a motion before the Commons, summoning former Vote Leave head honcho Dominic Cummings to appear before their inquiry into ""fake news,"" which has been pursuing allegations around misuse of data during the 2016 EU referendum. Mr Cummings has declined to appear before the Committee - and the report publishes his increasingly acrimonious correspondence with the committee's chairman Damian Collins. The DCMS committee is now escalating, by asking the Commons to issue a summons, so that it is no longer just them, but the whole House asking him to appear. Mr Collins has written to the Speaker to request that precedence be given to a motion in his name seeking an order of the House. Because this is a matter of privilege, in other words affecting the rights and immunities of the House, the Speaker can decide to give the matter precedence on the floor of the House. If the Speaker agrees, the motion will take precedence over the rest of the day's agenda - and given the way the inquiry has turned into a probe into the Leave campaign, that could prove quite an interesting debate. The move to raise this as an issue of parliamentary privilege is a gamble because if Mr Cummings continues to refuse to appear, the next step is to refer the matter to the Commons Privileges Committee...... and what then? This becomes a test case for the Commons, indeed Parliament's ability to summon witnesses. And there's the rub. It is not clear that Parliament has effective, human rights compliant powers to compel witnesses. Rupert Murdoch initially declined to give evidence to the Culture Committee in the 2010-15 Parliament, before the eruption of the phone hacking scandal forced him to attend.Sports Direct boss Mike Ashley ignored repeated requests to be questioned by MPs on the business committee about working conditions at his warehouse - initially calling the committee a ""joke"" - before finally submitting to a grilling in June 2016.Irene Rosenfeld, chief executive of the US food giant, Kraft declined to appear before the Business, Innovation and Skills Committee, which criticised her for a ""regrettably dismissive attitude"" which, in a carefully chosen phrase, ""steered close to a contempt of the House"". More recently, Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg turned down an invitation to appear before the culture committee, a decision Damian Collins called ""absolutely astonishing"". The reality was they had no real sanction, beyond public opinion and political opprobrium, to back up their summons. Mr Murdoch may have, in the end, been persuaded that non-appearance would harm his reputation, when scandal struck his company. And others might fear the reputational cost of refusal. But any reading of Dominic Cummings' exchanges with Damian Collins suggests that he is not very bothered. On 10 May, he wrote: ""A summons will have ZERO positive impact on my decision and is likely only to mean I withdraw my offer of friendly cooperation, given you will have shown greater interest in grandstanding than truth-seeking, which is one of the curses of the committee system. I hope you reconsider and put truth-seeking first.""  Mr Collins said today that he had ""made repeated, reasonable requests for him to appear, but so far he has refused to do this"". The next step would be to refer the case to the Committee of Privileges which would then hold an inquiry, seeking evidence from the parties, before making a report to the House - which might include a recommendation for further action. The Commons has the power to admonish those that it finds in contempt, something it last did in September 2016, when the Privileges committee said two witnesses, Colin Myler and Tom Crone, had misled the Culture, Media and Sport Committee by ""answering questions falsely"". It recommended that the Commons should ""formally admonish"" them, and in October 2016, the House debated the motion, including whether the media executives should be summoned to appear at the bar of the House to receive their admonition. This option was rejected, largely because MPs thought it would look over-theatrical, but they did pass a motion of formal admonishment. Maybe being admonished for contempt of Parliament might damage Mr Cummings' prospects of returning to Whitehall as a ministerial special advisor, if for example his old patron Michael Gove became PM. But maybe he would not care. In their darker imaginings, the Commons authorities fear a situation where the Serjeant at Arms is dispatched to fetch a reluctant witness, only to become embroiled in an embarrassing, and probably televised stand-off. It is far from clear that the Serjeant has powers to enter private property, still less to put Mr Cummings in an arm lock and frogmarch him to Westminster. So, if a summons is effectively ignored, what then? Perhaps MPs would have to legislate to give themselves proper human rights-compliant powers. There's a handy model available, in the shape of the Australian Parliament's powers - but there is the small detail of finding the time to legislate in the middle of Brexit. "

Mr Jones wrote to Business Secretary Greg Clarke on Tuesday, saying the Welsh Government was prepared to put in cash to ""enable the project to move forward"".""When we spoke yesterday, I raised the possibility of the Welsh and UK Governments making a joint offer to Tidal Lagoon Power in relation to the Swansea Bay project,"" the first minister said in his letter.""Such an offer would, I believe, strike an appropriate balance between supporting a pathfinder, low carbon energy generation project, in line with the findings of your own Hendry Review, while providing value for money.""Mr Jones told Mr Clarke he would ""welcome a discussion about this proposal as soon as possible so that we can put an end to the ongoing uncertainty"".Telling the Senedd about his letter, the first minister called for the lagoon to be offered the same strike price - the agreed purchase price for energy - as the new Hinkley Point nuclear power station in Somerset.""If it's right for Hinckley, it's right for Swansea,"" he said.A previous offer of ""substantial"" Welsh Government support had been made in January, although no figure was publicly given at that time.Speaking to BBC Radio Wales earlier on Tuesday, Mr Cairns stressed that the UK government had taken no decision yet on whether to back the lagoon.Swansea Council leader Rob Stewart called the Welsh Government's offer ""a game-changer"".""I hope the UK government recognises it because we cannot let this opportunity slip through our hands,"" he added."

Some GP surgeries - which are typically small businesses - have struggled to complete the paperwork accurately in time for them to secure visas.One medic, Mervin Wong from Malaysia, faced months of delays before he could start practising and feared he would be deported.He told Today: ""It seems a bit absurd that it was easier to hire a GP from a European country who had never trained, never studied in the UK than it was for me to get a job.""Another GP living in Saudi Arabia told the programme he had been accepted as a trainee in the UK, but refused entry to the country because of the cap on the annual numbers of skilled migrants.The home secretary has previously said he will take a ""fresh look"" at the cap.A Home Office spokeswoman said: ""We remain within our published service standard for processing sponsor licence applications."""

""Having the capacity to bring assessments back in-house will put it in a far stronger position to turn the screws on its hitherto failing contractors, in the interests of claimants and all taxpayers. ""This should serve as notice for Atos and Capita to start delivering, or else.""In February, Mr Field's committee found ""a pervasive culture of mistrust"" around the assessment process for Pip - benefit payments made to help people aged 16 to 64 cope with the extra costs they face due to ill health or disability.A Department for Work and Pensions source said the re-tendering process for assessments would begin after the two-year period - in which other contractors may be successful.The government has accepted the key finding of the DWP committee report, to make video recording of assessment interviews a standard part of the process.On Monday, Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey told MPs the government intended to pilot the move to ""make sure it is right"", adding that such recordings will ensure people get an ""honest appraisal"".Labour MP Nic Dakin raised concerns over a Scunthorpe constituent whose PIP assessment ""did not reflect the truth"" of the conversation they had had with an assessor, adding: ""This happens too often to be just coincidence.""Ms McVey replied: ""We all have to have faith in the conversations in those assessments and that is why I look forward to having them videoed to make sure we see, we hear, we know what's going on."""

These figures produced a total cost for UK-EU trade in goods of about £17bn-£20bn a year, he said.The committee also heard from the bosses of the ports of Calais and Zeebrugge, who seemed confident that if politicians could decide what they wanted that it could be delivered by the end of December 2020, when the transition period is due to end."

Who is behind it?Best for Britain aims to persuade MPs to back a referendum on the final Brexit deal secured by Theresa May when they vote on it in the autumn, with staying in the EU an option on the ballot paper.It would aim to persuade enough Leave voters to change their mind to vote to keep Britain in the EU - but the first stage of its campaign aims to generate pressure for another referendum.Its campaign slogan - already displayed on billboards in London, Birmingham, Manchester and Liverpool and in newspaper ads - is ""We all deserve a final say on the Brexit deal.""According to the Observer, Best for Britain will send a ""roadmap"" to MPs and peers, setting out how they could stop Brexit, when it launches its campaign on Friday. The group believes a referendum could be held in December, or possibly as late as February or March - when the UK is set to officially quit the EU - if Brussels agrees to it.It is targeting much of its campaigning muscle at the Labour Party's front bench, which is against another referendum - but it also needs at least 10 Conservative ""rebels"" on board in order to win a vote in Parliament on an amendment calling for a referendum.The campaign is also attempting to shore up support among Labour backbenchers sceptical about Brexit and is reportedly targeting 50 Leave-supporting Labour constituencies with billboard ads close to MPs' offices. The campaign will also lobby the big trade unions in an effort to exert pressure on the Labour leadership and is running a social-media campaign and a ""Labour Against Brexit"" speaking tour by leading Labour Remainers. It is also funding a grassroots campaign and has handed cash to local volunteers to ""help stop Brexit in your area"". Best for Britain was set up in April 2017, just before June's snap general election. Its initial aim was to encourage tactical voting to try to get more pro-Remain MPs into the House of Commons. The group said more than a million people had consulted its tactical voting website ahead of 8 June to find pro-Remain candidates.It reported spending £353,118 between June 2016 and June 2017, and made donations to pro-European candidates in marginal seats, including the Lib Dems' Tom Brake, Labour's Peter Kyle and Green MP Caroline Lucas. One of the group's founding members, Gina Miller, defeated the government over its power to trigger Article 50 without parliamentary consent, in the Supreme Court in January 2017. However, she stood down the day after the 2017 general election, saying the group had become too party political.Officially registered as UK-EU Open Policy Limited, Best for Britain is led by business and charity sector figures. This is in contrast to the MP-led People's Vote campaign - which is also pushing for a referendum on the final Brexit deal, although the two campaigns will join forces on 23 June to stage a march on Parliament.Best for Britain has £2.4m in its coffers and is asking donors for another £3.2m to realise its campaigning ambitions, according to its director of communications, Paul Butters, a former spokesman for Tim Farron, the ex-Liberal Democrat leader.The biggest individual donor is international financier George Soros, a Hungarian-born US citizen, who has given Best for Britain £800,000 in total so far, with £400,000 of that coming since the start of the year through his pro-European Open Society Foundation.Having made his billions in finance, including betting against sterling on Black Wednesday in 1992 - which gained him a reputation as the ""man who broke the Bank of England"" - Mr Soros, 87, donated more than £8bn to philanthropic causes between 1979 and 2011.UK electoral law bans foreign donations but only in the run-up to elections or referendums. Best for Britain says it has not taken money from overseas because the Soros donations came via his Open Society Foundations UK branch. The campaign is also keen to stress that it has also raised significant sums from more than 8,000 small donors.But the involvement of Mr Soros has generated a backlash in the Brexit-backing media, with the Daily Mail telling him on its front page: ""Butt out Mr Soros. You can keep your tainted money.""Mr Soros hit back at the Daily Mail's headline in an article for the Mail on Sunday, explaining why his love for Britain had led him to campaign against the ""tragic mistake"" of Brexit - and the campaign launched a Gofundme crowdfunding page entitled Help Best for Britain fight the Daily Mail, which has raised more than £64,000 in the past 12 days.Pro-Brexit campaign Leave Means Leave is, meanwhile, raising funds to combat Best for Britain, with its co-chairman John Longworth telling supporters in an email: ""We are determined to secure the swift, clean Brexit you all voted for.""Best for Britain is currently under investigation by the Electoral Commission, which oversees campaign spending, for submitting a return with invoices missing and for failing to return a donation of £25,000 from an impermissible donor within 30 days. It says it has complied with all relevant regulations.Lord Malloch-Brown, appointed 2 November 2017. A former foreign office minister, under Gordon Brown, who became a life peer in July 2007. Before that, he served as UN deputy secretary general, and from 1977 to 1979 he was a political correspondent at the pro-EU Economist, returning in 1983 for three years as founding editor of the Economist Development Report.The 64-year-old peer sparked controversy when he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme last month that Britain might as well stay in the EU, given the impossibility of divorcing itself from the Continent's problems. He said: ""Britain's history as an island nation adjacent to mainland Europe is when we try to, sort of, pull away from Europe's problems and close ourselves off to them, they have a horrible habit of infecting us anyway - appeasement in the 1930s, you name it. For centuries, Britain has ignored events on continental Europe at its peril.""Chief executive officer: Eloise Todd, 41. Until December 2016, Ms Todd worked in Brussels as global director of U2 singer Bono's anti-poverty charity, One. She had worked in the European Parliament for seven years after graduating from the College of Europe in Bruges.The Guardian has suggested that it was her personal connection to Best for Britain's biggest donor, George Soros, through the international development sector, that attracted him to the group, instead of better-known campaigns such as Open Britain, which is now part of the People's Vote group.Director: Sir Clive Cowdery, appointed 16 December 2016. The insurance businessman founded the Resolution Foundation think tank in 2005. He was chairman and chief executive of General Electric Insurance Holdings from 1998 to 2003. Knighted in the 2016 New Year Honours for services to children and social mobility, Sir Clive, 55, is worth an estimated £147m, according to the Sunday Times Rich List 2018, in which he ranked 804th in Britain. Director: Shakuntala Ghosh, appointed 3 March 2017. Chief executive of the charity Clore Social Leadership, which runs management training courses for charity workers, since April 2015, ""Shaks"" Ghosh, 61, led homelessness charity Crisis from 1997 to 2007. She has also held posts at the National Housing Federation and Centrepoint.Chief economist: Anatole Kaletsky, appointed 16 December 2016. Another former Economist journalist, Mr Kaletsky was appointed chairman of the Institute for New Economic Thinking in 2012, a foundation established after the 2008 financial crisis with $200m (£150m) of grants from, among others, George Soros. In 2010, he wrote Capitalism 4.0: The Birth of a New Economy in the Aftermath of Crisis.Director: Peter Norris, appointed 16 December 2016. Known as Sir Richard Branson's right-hand man, Mr Norris, 63, has been chairman of the Virgin Group since 2001. Sir Richard donated £25,000 and office space to the campaign in 2017 to help launch it. Before Virgin, Mr Norris was chief executive of Barings Bank when it collapsed in the Nick Leeson ""rogue trader"" scandal in 1995. He was temporarily banned from being a director by the Department of Trade and Industry in 1998.Director: Stephen Peel, appointed 19 October 2016. A former Goldman Sachs executive who represented Great Britain in rowing at the 1988 Seoul Olympics, Mr Peel, 52, has donated more than £75,000 to Best for Britain.Gina Miller: The businesswoman and philanthropist initially spearheaded Best for Britain, saying in her launch speech: ""Throughout the course of this general election campaign, we will be focusing on educating and empowering people to make a tactical vote and choosing MPs who will do the best for Britain. ""   But she stood down the day after the 2017 general election and has distanced herself from the group, saying it had become more focused on ""bringing down the Tories"" than Brexit.Alan Milburn: Chairman of the Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission from 2012 to 2017, the 60-year-old served in Tony Blair's government, as chief secretary to the Treasury from 1998 to 1999, then as secretary of state for health until 2003. He has been chancellor of Lancaster University since 2015. He resigned from Best of Britain on 3 March 2017.Sally Tallant: The director of the Liverpool Biennial festival of contemporary art, Sally Tallant, 50, resigned from the group in April 2017."
2018-06-05,Voting marathon,https://web.archive.org//web/20180606004110/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44357101,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowEven at lunchtime today, a former minister stalking the green and gold corridors of this place, made a familiar moan, ""there's nothing happening in this place"".MPs complain often ""we have hardly anything to do"", so few new draft laws are actually being put forward, so little do they have to scrutinise and then vote on. Suggest that to the government and it would push back pretty strongly, even if some ministers might raise an eyebrow while doing so. But next Tuesday isn't going to be like that at all with a marathon session of Brexit business back in the Commons. The Lords beat the government fifteen times on its EU Withdrawal Bill, forcing changes to ministers' plans. The government will try to unpick those alterations. So while it's hard to know precisely how many votes there will be, there will be a lot, and it is certainly unusual to have them all in one day. The bill passed its first hurdle in the Commons a few months ago, but the House of Lords then made plenty of nips and tucks, or amendments, on how customs should work after Brexit, on the Irish border, on whether we should stay in a different free trade area, the EEA, and plenty of other issues besides.What the government wants is to undo the changes the Lords made to the bill.But it is far from clear that they can rely on the votes in the Commons to do so. For many weeks potential Tory rebels who want a closer relationship with the EU after Brexit, have been planning how they might vote - this could be the moment then they gang together to beat the government. They are confident that they could do so if they choose to, one of them said to me today, ""some of us just are starting to think we have to fill in the gaps"" trying to force the prime minister's hand to make up for what some see as the absence of leadership, saying No 10 has an ""untenable lack of strategy, and it's running out of road"".Whether in the end they have the guts to do so next Tuesday, there's already a row. After months of a relatively quiet Parliament, trying to ram 15 votes through on the bill in one day is not exactly giving MPs time and space for debate. Some around here are crying foul already. Surely the whips aren't trying to squeeze out dissent in the Remain camp?  Perish the thought. But it's worth noting on the Eurosceptic side there's satisfaction that the bill is at last returning to the Commons, and the votes all take place in one day - ""bish bash bosh"" - as one source described it.There's the possibility that the bill, with losses or victories for the government will speed straight back to the lords within days. Next week there certainly will not be the case that ""there's nothing happening"".PS: While Parliament is going to sound very divided in the next ten days, if you have been following the Customs debate in particular - which I know I have probably written about far too much - there is a sense, not of an answer, but of a developing compromise. Two Cabinet ministers have told me now that they expect the prime minister to end up in a position where she plumps for the revised 'max fac' proposal, but has to admit it won't be ready for years. One of them today suggested the most likely outcome would be to move to a new 'Customs Partnership' at the end of the Brexit Implementation Period, then to 'max fac' once the technology has been developed in years to come. What Brussels will make of it is a different question. And with the Brexit White Paper possibly delayed until after the June summit, it is possible that the government still doesn't come up with its solution on this until July. PPS: If that's one compromise, here's another potential one. Open Europe, the think tank that is officially neutral but that has close links to Eurosceptics has published a paper putting forward a possible compromise for the future economic relationship with the EU. In essence, the UK would stay closely tied to the EU in terms of goods, but go our own way on services. Nothing about this is easy, and again, Brussels has always pushed back at the idea of splitting up any sectors. But it has gathered quite a bit of attention and support around Westminster, and it's worth a read. Click here to read it.  "
2018-06-05,The great survivor,https://web.archive.org//web/20180606004110/http://www.bbc.com/news/health-40162245,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHe has overseen worsening waiting times for cancer care, hospital operations and emergency treatment. Hospitals have bust their budgets by record amounts. And there has been the first all-out strike by doctors. But despite all this, Jeremy Hunt has remained as health secretary in England.With five years and 274 days under his belt, he is the longest-serving custodian of the NHS, having surpassed Margaret Thatcher's Health Minister, Norman Fowler, and Aneurin Bevan, the man who set up the health service in the first place. How has he survived so long?To understand Mr Hunt's reign, you need to go back to the start. He was appointed, in September 2012, because he was seen as a skilled communicator who could help articulate a clear vision for the health service after the furore over the changes implemented by his predecessor, Andrew Lansley.Mr Hunt immediately took a different tack - and it is one that has come to shape his time as health secretary. One of his first moves as health secretary was to go on holiday with his family. It had already been booked, following the London Olympics and a tricky period as culture secretary during which he had become embroiled in row over his relationship with Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.While on holiday, he read the report into the Stafford Hospital scandal, which Sir Robert Francis had just finished. Those close to him said the findings had horrified him. It was not just the poor care and suffering that had happened, but that it had been allowed to go on so long without the alarm being raised.He came back convinced he needed to champion patient safety. In the following years, he went on to overhaul the inspection regime, introduce a new duty of candour on staff and fresh rules about whistle-blowers.Someone working with him at the time told me this was ""classic Jeremy"". They said: ""He likes to pick a central theme and focus on it relentlessly. It is how he believes you get things done in government.""In the speeches I've heard over the years, he runs through the stories of those who have suffered. People such as:It is powerful stuff. These are the very worst examples of NHS care. They should never have happened. And only his harshest critics would disagree with what he says about them. Mr Titcombe has said the health secretary's efforts should be applauded. He believes he has ""changed the game when it comes to patient safety"".""I watched my son die. And then I watched the NHS close ranks afterwards,"" Mr Titcombe said. ""[Mr Hunt] was [one of] the few people who listened. And he took action.""But what has annoyed many who work in the NHS is the way he has gone about tackling the problem. They feel he has blamed them and questioned their professionalism at a time when his government has overseen the toughest funding settlement the NHS has ever had.Nowhere is this clearer than in his handling of the junior-doctor contract row. Emboldened by the election victory in 2015, Mr Hunt returned to office determined to achieve the manifesto commitment of creating a seven-day NHS and - as a result, he argued - safer care for patients.He was markedly more aggressive than he had been in his first two and a half years in post. He criticised what he said was a ""Monday to Friday"" culture, prompting an outpouring of anger. On social media, medics started posing photographs of themselves at work using the hashtag #ImInWorkJeremy.The clash set the tone for a difficult few months for the health secretary. Contract negotiations with junior doctors had already started and stalled. And the stalemate soon worsened, with the British Medical Association balloting for industrial action. After months of wrangling, junior doctors took part in a series of walkouts, two of which involved all-out strikes where emergency care was not covered - the first time that had ever happened in the NHS.Mr Hunt acknowledges this was his most difficult time as health secretary. And while he remains unapologetic for taking on the BMA, which he says was spreading misinformation about the contract, he accepts he should have done more to tackle one major complaint of doctors - rota gaps.Since the dispute, he has announced increases in training places for both doctors and nurses. Following the strikes, Mr Hunt's approval rating actually dropped lower than predecessor Andrew Lansley's had at the height of his troubles.And by the time Theresa May became prime minister, in the summer of 2016, there was strong speculation that he was going to lose his job.In fact, on the morning of her first reshuffle, there were reports he had actually been sacked but then reinstated when it had become clear not all the people Ms May had earmarked for posts in her first cabinet had been willing to take up the offer.This has been denied by Mr Hunt and his team - and certainly the health secretary had the last laugh by tweeting on the day: ""Reports of my death have been greatly exaggerated."" The mere fact he has survived so long in one of the most demanding posts in government means speculation about his future is a given. Ahead of the last election, reports surfaced that Ben Gummer, who has served as a junior minister under Mr Hunt, had been earmarked as the next health secretary.But Mr Gummer lost his seat. And, with Theresa May left weakened following the election, there was limited change in the cabinet. Indeed, some began to see Mr Hunt's longevity as a benefit to the government during a period when NHS waiting times have worsened and attracted negative headlines.Norman Lamb, a former Liberal Democrat health spokesman and a minister in the coalition, once described him as the ""shock absorber"", able to take the flak for the government.But as he has gone on and with the NHS in its 70th year, there is a sense attitudes towards Mr Hunt have begun to change again.At the last reshuffle, in the winter, it is understood he was offered the job of business secretary but this time had the confidence to tell the prime minister he wanted to stay where he was.Even among his critics, this news was met with a grudging acceptance. There is, it seems, a growing feeling - even among those who have wished him out in the past - that it is better to have someone in post who understands the health service and has the power to argue for it at the cabinet table than a newcomer.Behind the scenes, Mr Hunt was championing the need for a long-term funding settlement in late 2017 - and the fact that the prime minister has now committed to that is in large part down to his influence.Discussions about how big a rise the NHS should receive continue. But by all accounts Mr Hunt is pushing back against the Treasury, which seems to want to offer only an extra 2% a year when economists are arguing it will need to be nearer 4% if the NHS is to remain in good health.How he fares in those discussions could well shape his legacy as health secretary.Read more from NickFollow Nick on Twitter"

Respondents were asked to complete a detailed online questionnaire on identity and belonging.  You need a modern browser to view the interactive content in this page.If the postcode search does not launch click here.The results of the survey highlighted that:About half of the 20,081 people surveyed (49%) believe England's best years are over while one in six (17%) thought they were still to come.The survey does not reveal at which point England apparently passed its best, but the results suggest:John Denham, director of the Centre for English Identity and Politics at the University of Winchester, said ""pessimism"" was not unique to one group or area of England.The former Labour cabinet minister said he believed giving people a greater say over how they are governed would reduce the pessimism.""Older people do tend to think things were better in the past but what's striking is that there isn't a demographic where the optimists outweigh the pessimists,"" said Mr Denham.""This pessimism is not as universal in Wales and Scotland, where more people think the future will be better than the past, and where devolution has asked people what sort of nation they wanted to be in the 21st Century.""England outside London has never had that. People have a sense that no-one is talking about the people outside the capital. In the EU referendum, the Leave campaign's slogan 'take back control' cut through for that reason.""Nearly three quarters of over-65s  are proud to be English compared with fewer than half of those aged 18 to 24.Mr Denham said: ""Young people will tend to be less patriotic than older people wherever they are, whether that's England, Scotland or Wales.""They will have a more cosmopolitan view of the world. And in the younger generation there are more people from black and minority ethnic groups who are more likely to identify as British than as English.""It doesn't mean that Englishness and English pride is disappearing, but we are looking at a future where both Britishness and Englishness will mean a lot to a lot of people.""Being born in England makes someone English according to eight out of 10 people surveyed.Living in England for less than five years qualifies someone as English in the minds of just 14% of those who responded.For just over a third of people (38%) considering yourself English is enough and trumps even living in England for 10 or more years or even being able to speak English.A sense of humour, tradition, manners and fair play are characteristics most people surveyed associate with being English.Although more than half of respondents consider strongly that generosity and plain-speaking were part of the English identity, less than half think the English are a liberal, outward-looking people. And less than four in 10 consider Englishness to be defined by ""yob culture"". Only one in four consider the English to be a ""loud"" people.""So-called yob culture is not such a dominant image of Englishness as some people think,"" said Mr Denham.""If you see footage of English football fans smashing up a town square, you're going to think about yob culture at the time, but most people associate Englishness with much more positive values most of the time.

The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 1%.The council level estimates shown in the search box above are based on the poll and a statistical procedure called multilevel regression and post-stratification or MRP. The technique produces estimates for small areas based on a limited amount of data. It uses the people from each local authority to predict that area's results, but to ensure that this small amount of data is representative of the wider population the estimates are balanced out using comparable data from the poll from the rest of the country and the census on the demographic make-up of the local authority in question. As with all models the figures are subject to uncertainty. The analysis was run by Dr Kevin Cunningham working with Dr Ian Warren of @ElectionData. More details on MRP are available from YouGov."

""We've been left in limbo,"" says Fiona Godfrey, a freelance legal consultant living with her family in Luxembourg who also volunteers with the pressure group British in Europe. ""I think it's shameful. We should never ever have been put in this position."" The dilemma is that what has been agreed so far between the UK government and the EU - in the Withdrawal Agreement they are negotiating - will only give British citizens the right to live and work in the country where they reside. In Fiona's case, that means tiny Luxembourg. But at the moment she works in other countries every week, relying on her rights of freedom of movement within the EU single market. ""In 20 years I've worked in every EU member state, plus Norway and Switzerland,"" she says. ""We want to keep the rights we have - we need to keep our free movement, we need to keep our rights to work, and we need to keep recognition of our professional qualifications, because that is another huge issue.""Some UK citizens in the EU will be able to continue to work as they do now. If, for example, you are defined as a frontier worker - crossing a border on a regular basis for a nine-to-five job on a regular employment contract - then you should be OK. But if you are defined as a cross-border supplier of services there is no guarantee as yet that you'll be able to work after Brexit as you do now.  New restrictions could apply to all sorts of people:  lawyers, architects, truckers… or freelance chefs cooking for hungry skiers in the French Alps.""It's been very stressful. Nearly two years now, and we still have no clarity on what is going to happen and how we are going to be affected,"" says Helen Malaburn, speaking from her home near Les Trois Vallees in France. She and her husband have lived there for 10 years, cooking for tourists and local residents during the winter ski season. But in the summer, the work dries up, and they spend their time working in places like Greece and Spain. ""At the moment, we do approximately half of our work outside France,"" Helen says. ""There's no way we could sustain ourselves on the winter work that we do.""""We're completely dependent on being able to work across the EU, and having our qualifications (as chefs) recognised in every country, like they are now."" Helen and Fiona are not alone. The debate about UK citizens living in the EU often focuses on pensioners seeking warmer weather - and they certainly have concerns of their own. But roughly 80% of the one million or so Brits in the EU are of working age or younger.There is a lack of clarity on a number of other issues that concern them. It is still not clear, for example, whether UK citizens in the EU will have access to university education on the same financial terms as they do now; nor whether - as part of a bureaucratic process - they will have to make new applications to remain in the countries where they live. One solution to the dilemma facing so many people is to apply for dual citizenship. Both Helen and Fiona are in the process of doing so, as are many of their British counterparts. But it's not an option available in every country - Austria and the Netherlands, for example, don't allow it and other countries have some restrictions. Nor is there a guarantee of success, and the application process takes time. And that is the one thing that is now in short supply. The European Parliament has promised to take a tough line on protecting citizens' rights, and the Dutch MEP Sophie in 't Veld is critical of both sides in the Brexit negotiations.  ""They're making it into a legalistic issue,"" she says, ""but this is about the fundamental rights of people who have set up their lives here in Europe and are counting on free movement.""So this is a condition for the European Parliament to give its consent to the Withdrawal Agreement.""Does she think the European Parliament would otherwise struggle to approve the agreement (which it has to do before Brexit happens)? ""Yes. We have adopted a series of resolutions where we set out our conditions for giving consent, and this is one of them.""So when can UK citizens expect their concerns to be addressed? The EU says the whole notion of ""mobility of citizens"" will be part of negotiations on the future relationship between the UK and the EU. But those talks have barely begun, and they won't be concluded by the time Brexit is due to take place in ten months' time. The fear is that ""mobility of citizens"" would then get caught up in haggling over all sorts of other issues in negotiations on a future free trade agreement. It wouldn't be a comfortable place to be. ""I don't feel like a bargaining chip, I am a bargaining chip, and I shouldn't be,"" says Fiona Godfrey. On behalf of British in Europe, she has this appeal for Theresa May: ""Write to the member states, write to [Michel] Barnier, and say we would like British citizens to have continuing free movement. ""We think it is a deal that can be done if she just makes the request.""The proposed 21-month transition (or implementation) period after Brexit gives everyone involved a bit of breathing space, but time to include a deal on future free movement in the Withdrawal Agreement is fast running out. So does the government think that is still a possibility? In a written statement, the Department for Exiting the European Union, said: ""We've reached a reciprocal deal for our citizens during the implementation period that recognises the valuable contribution that EU citizens make to the UK, and that UK citizens make to the EU.""The issue of onward movement rights for UK citizens in the EU has not been forgotten and we will raise this in the next phase of negotiations.""The UK will seek to reach a final deal that is in the mutual interest of citizens living across the continent.""But no-one knows when that final deal on the future relationship will be agreed. And the concern among many UK citizens in the EU is that they will have no certainty about their future status, and their ability to work as they do now, until after the UK has left.Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questionsFollow us on Twitter"

The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks  have now moved on to future relations - after agreement was reached on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are just beginning. Both sides hope they can agree within six months on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all.  Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide, but first let's go back to the basics...It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro.Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.5%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand near a 40-year year low of 4.3%. Annual house price increases have fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 4.9% in the year to January 2018, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May is seeking to put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. If passed, it will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, is supposed to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said continued membership of the single market has to be an option in negotiations with Brussels.   Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The single market is a very different beast - it is not just about the trade in goods. It allows the free movement of people, money and services as if the EU was a single country.Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each playing roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border check for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanAn agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement.The full details are not yet known but UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72.We don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pounds buy fewer euros. A slump in the value of the dollar means the exchange rate with the pound is pretty close to where it was before the referendum.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.A method for calculating the bill has been agreed, but the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more.The question of how and when payments will be made still needs to resolved, but it will be a schedule lasting for many years to come, and it is highly unlikely that anyone will ever be able to give an exact figure for the size of the divorce bill.UK sources say it will be up to £40bn, but some EU sources expect it to be higher than that. No-one can say for sure, and both sides want to keep it that way.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 6.5% in 2016 to 2.7% in 2017, according to the Halifax. It said the slowdown was driven by a squeeze on real wage growth.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-06-05,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180606004110/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to £840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

On the two previous occasions in 1970 and February 1974 the PM and the party lost office. While there is no other conceivable administration in the new parliament other than a Conservative-led one, it remains to be seen whether the PM will retain her position. However, so long as the Conservatives can reach an accommodation with the DUP they will have a working majority in the House of Commons.  BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed:When the general election exit poll was revealed at 10pm, the pound immediately dropped by 2% as investors took a position that a hung parliament was a possible outcome of the general election.Why would that cause the currency to decline? Because a hung parliament means that the government's direction of travel would be less certain.

Here's what happened.A lively session as Jeremy Corbyn sought to put the prime minister on the rack over the government's delayed white paper on the UK's post-Brexit relationship with the EU. When was it going to be be published? The plan was to publish an ""ambitious"" and ""detailed"" white paper, said Mrs May, but she declined to say when.So the Labour leader tried again - would MPs get a chance to read it before next week's important debates on the EU Withdrawal Bill?Mrs May avoided the question again and then tried to hit back, asking Mr Corbyn if he would confirm his party's position on a second EU referendum.""Last time I looked at the order paper, it said Prime Minister's Questions,"" said Mr Corbyn. He then asked if the cabinet had made its mind up yet about post-Brexit customs arrangements. Had the sub-committees set up to choose one of the two options even met? “Will we be told about it?” @jeremycorbyn “We have already set out our ambition for our future relationship with the EU” @theresa_may #pmqs pic.twitter.com/DL9HvFgT2OEnd of Twitter post  by @daily_politicsMrs May repeated her question - which she said wasn't a question - about whether Mr Corbyn would rule out a second referendum.""It is not the opposition that is conducting the negotiations but, very sadly, it is not the government either,"" said Mr Corbyn, to cheers from his own side. He ridiculed a proposal by Brexit Secretary David Davis for a 10 mile ""buffer zone"" in Northern Ireland. Was that now the government's position?The PM didn't rise to that one either, simply repeating what we already know about Brexit talks. Then it was time for a quickfire round.Mr Corbyn: ""Does it remain her plan to leave the European Union in March 2019 and complete the transition by December 2020?""Mrs May: ""Yes"".Mr Corbyn (in a quizzical tone): ""Aah.""“No answer on the White Paper and I don’t think we have had an answer on the buffer zone”  @jeremycorbyn before getting a one-word reply to  transition period query #bbcdp pic.twitter.com/gRrVglxM1iEnd of Twitter post 3 by @daily_politicsNot all Tory MPs agreed with her on that, said Mr Corbyn, quoting her former deputy Damian Green, who had said there may be a second transition period.""When it comes to Brexit, this government has delivered more delays and more cancellations than Northern Rail,"" said Mr Corbyn as he tried to shoehorn in another of the week's big stories.He said the government had ""ripped up"" its own Brexit timetable ""just like our shambolic privatised railways"", adding: ""Which will last longer the Northern Rail franchise or her premiership?""Mrs May laid into Labour's divisions on Brexit, quoting Sir Keir Starmer, who she said had described his party's latest position on the single market as a ""pretence"". She accused Labour of ""trying to frustrate the Brexit process at every stage"". Labour's MEPs had voted against the withdrawal bill and were now refusing to rule out a second referendum. ""This government,"" she said, was ""delivering on the vote of the British people"".The SNP's leader at Westminster Ian Blackford kept up the pressure on Mrs May over Brexit, asking her about leaked warnings from officials about shortages and queues in the worst case Brexit scenario and the Dutch government telling businesses not to buy British goods.But he also took a swipe at Jeremy Corbyn, who he accused of ""playing games"" over his refusal to back an amendment next week on staying in the European Economic Area (he made that point within the question asking Mrs May to back the amendment).The PM said businesses wanted Scotland to remain part of the UK.“Does the PM understand the catastrophic negotiating position she has cornered herself into?” @IanBlackfordMP to @theresa_may #pmqs pic.twitter.com/O9urIMD5xYEnd of Twitter post 4 by @daily_politicsConservative MP Henry Smith took his cue from Jeremy Corbyn, linking Brexit talks to rail delays.

Mrs May said Heathrow expansion would be ""fully financed by the private sector"" and the company would not be bailed out if things went wrong.“Heathrow have played an absolute blinder with the DfT” @JustineGreening on the “poisoned pill” about plans for a third runway at the west London airport #pmqs pic.twitter.com/XjKc5o2UXfEnd of Twitter post 6 by @daily_politicsThe Lords will take on the Commons next week in a charity pigeon race aid of veterans' mental health charity Combat Stress.

So this line of questioning plays on Tory nerves and nods to the real concerns in the world beyond Westminster. I think this was Jeremy Corbyn's best, most focused PMQs performance.The PM brushed off the invocation, from the SNP's Ian Blackford, of the ""Brexit apocalypse"" reported in the Sunday Times, which related official warnings of food and medicine shortages - but Mr Blackford's call for the UK to remain in the EEA (the so-called Norway Option for Brexit) was aimed at least as much at Labour divisions on this issue as it was at the Tories.Like many of his questions, it will feed into the rather different Scottish Brexit debate.On another flank, the PM had to fend off an awkward question on Heathrow expansion from the former Transport Secretary, Justine Greening.Her Putney constituency is under the flightpath, so, like may South-West London MPs, she has good local reasons to oppose the move - but she attacked the proposed deal on ideological grounds, saying it nationalised all the risk and privatised all the gains… a line of attack that could resonate dangerously among Conservative MPs.This is an issue the PM needs to handle carefully, or there could be a considerable electoral price to pay in marginal Commons seats.Corbyn is basically wiping the floor with May at #PMQs despite Labour's position on Brexit being currently a puzzle even to much of the Labour partyEnd of Twitter post  by @gabyhinsliffCorbyn, despite his own splits on Brexit, managing to expose May's lack of answers on customs, NI, timing of white paper and more.But as both sides lack clarity what will voters think?End of Twitter post  by @paulwaughAn audio download of some of the key exchanges, and what Andrew Neil and his Daily Politics guests made of the exchanges."

While she met some ""amazing people"" during her time in Downing Street, she suggested she did not ""enjoy"" the ceremonial aspects of the role.Mrs Cameron spent a decade in the public eye after her husband became Conservative leader in 2005.

Secondly, there is what has been described as a fudge on the European court.Read Laura's full blogMr Corbyn said the negotiations were in chaos, with no cabinet agreement on a customs framework and a promised document setting out the UK's negotiating position on trade and other issues ""no where to be seen"" ahead of a crucial EU summit later this month. ""When it comes to Brexit, this government has delivered more delays and more cancellations than Northern Rail,"" he said.""The government's white paper is delayed, its customs proposals have been cancelled and it has ripped up its own timetable just like our shambolic privatised railways.""But Mrs May said Labour was standing in the way of progress on withdrawal despite voting to trigger exit talks. ""Since then, they have tried to frustrate Brexit at every stage,"" she said. She called on the Labour leader to rule out another Brexit referendum and said next week's votes on the EU Withdrawal Bill - on which the government faces potential defeat on a customs union and the question of a decisive parliamentary vote on the final deal - would ""test the sincerity"" of MPs to leaving the EU.Mrs May also came under pressure from Tory MPs, with Crawley MP Henry Smith saying his constituents wanted her to get on with both Brexit and sorting out the rail mess.

She ""absolutely recognises"" Israel's right to defend itself, she told Benjamin Netanyahu in Downing Street. But after the deaths of more than 100 Palestinians during the protests, it was time to ""find a way through"".Mr Netanyahu said some at the protests had been ""paid for and pushed by Hamas"" to try to kill and kidnap Israelis.Palestinian health officials said more than 120 people had been killed and 10,000 injured by Israeli troops over a six-week period between April and May, as a series of protests took place along the border between the Gaza Strip and Israel.On one day in May, 60 were said to have been killed when 40,000 people took part in demonstrations that coincided with the controversial relocation of the US embassy to Jerusalem.Last month, Mrs May said the use of live rounds by Israeli forces was ""deeply troubling"" and urged greater restraint. She also called for an independent investigation into the incident.On Wednesday, she welcomed Mr Netanyahu to Downing Street, then broached the subject with him face-to-face, and in front of the cameras. ""We have been concerned about the loss of Palestinian lives,"" she said. ""As you know, the UK absolutely recognises the right that Israel has for self-defence against the activities of extremists and terrorists. ""But with 100 Palestinian lives lost and a deteriorating situation in Gaza, I hope we can talk about how we can alleviate that situation and how we can ensure that we can get back to a position where we are able to find a way through to talk about a two-state solution.""Responding to her comments, Mr Netanyahu said the problems in Gaza were ""rooted in the fundamental goal of Hamas to destroy Israel"". He added: ""We are not witnessing a peaceful protest. In addition to burning our fields, these people are being paid for and pushed by Hamas to try to break into Israel's defences, kill as many Israelis as they can when they get through the border and kidnap our soldiers. ""This is not a non-violent protest, quite the contrary. ""We are doing everything we can to both minimise casualties and at the same time protect Israeli lives.""Later, Mr Netanyahu met with Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, who reiterated Mrs May's call for an independent inquiry. In a statement after the meeting, Mr Johnson said: ""The people of Israel and Gaza have the right to live safely in peace, without constant fear for their security.""We continue to press both Israel and the Palestinian authority on the need to refrain from actions which make peace more difficult.""A pleasure to meet @IsraeliPM @netanyahu today in London.

Brussels has also said it will restrict access to encrypted signals from Galileo.The move has sparked a furious reaction from the UK government, which is demanding £1bn back from the EU and has threatened to build a rival satellite system, at an estimated cost of £5bn.In a speech on post-Brexit security co-operation, Mr Davis said: ""We should be able, as trusted allies and friends of Europe to get an agreement that allows sensitive information to be shared.""He said British companies were being discriminated against and blocked from contracts - despite the fact that excluding the UK would delay Galileo by three years or more.""This is not an issue isolated to Galileo,"" he added.""The same is at risk of happening with the new European Defence Fund.""The UK had originally opposed the creation of the European Defence Fund, which co-ordinates joint operations by member states.The government wants to continue contributing troops, equipment and money to overseas EU military operations after Brexit.But Mr Davis said the EU's attitude to ""third countries"" - which the UK will become after Brexit - was standing in the way of that ambition. ""All of these unhelpful precedents and assumptions on how third countries should operate with the EU is hindering projects that would help the entire continent,"" he said in his speech.The UK had also opposed the creation of Galileo, when it was first proposed 18 years ago, but Britain's space industry had been a major player in the project, which is meant to be fully operational by 2026.It comes as the European Commission announced plans to pump an extra €5bn (£4.4bn) into space projects, including Galileo and the Copernicus Earth Observation Programme, which will be delivered in partnership with the European Space Agency.Britain will remain a member of the European Space Agency, which is not an EU body, after Brexit, and is willing to pay a fee of around £1bn to the European Commission to remain part of its space plans.But the Commission's spending proposals on are based on the assumption that it will get no more cash from the UK after Brexit.

Hoping that @DamianCollins can get some truthful answers out of Alexander Nix this time around. pic.twitter.com/Xb6UHUekuFEnd of Twitter post  by @chrisinsilicoThe company is now in administration and Mr Nix told MPs he had invested ""millions of dollars"" of his personal fortune in the last few months to pay the salaries and redundancies of staff.He also said he was ""deeply embarrassed"" about an undercover Channel 4 News report in which he discussed questionable methods - including sending ""Ukrainian girls"" to a candidate's home -  that might be used to gain clients.Mr Nix said he had used ""hyperbole"", admitting his claims had a ""significant impact"" on the firm he ran.But he claimed that the footage had been edited to misrepresent the context of his words, and that Cambridge Analytica would not have engaged in such tactics itself.The BBC has asked Channel 4 News to respond.Mr Nix also denied that two election videos made for  Nigeria and Kenya, which contained what he called ""unethical media content"", had anything to do with Cambridge Analytica.""I know the media wants to see us as this nefarious multi-national that influences politics around the world but the truth is that we are a very small advertising agency that works across a series of sectors,"" he said.He added that political work had made up just 25% of what his firm had done.""Most of our time is spent selling toothpaste and automotives,"" he said.Towards the end of the session, Mr Nix became emotional, accusing the committee of believing ""conspiracy theories"" and making ""sweeping assumptions"".He said that he felt ""victimised"" by their questioning and the media furore that had engulfed him in the last few months.And he claimed that his firm had been victim of an effort to force a second Brexit referendum by what he said were false claims that it had been involved in the first one.Carole Cadwalladr - the journalist that worked on the Observer investigation that helped cause Cambridge Analytica's downfall - mocked this allegation on Twitter.Nix just blamed ""Carole in the Guardian"" for everything that has come to pass for Cambridge Analytica. ""Carole thought if she attacked Cambridge Analytica...the Guardian could push for a second referendum. And that's exactly what has happened.""End of Twitter post  by @carolecadwalla"

Mr Ghosh has also insisted he is not Islamophobic.Mr Amin also criticised the unsuccessful London mayoral campaign of Zac Goldsmith, who attempted to link his Labour rival Sadiq Khan to Islamist extremists.He said he had been a Conservative member for 35 years and did not want to ""rock the boat"" but: ""The Conservative Muslim Forum decided unanimously that the matter was so serious that we should actually make our position known publicly.""The Conservative hierarchy had ""wished the issue would go away"" rather than deal with it, he said, adding that while the party was not anti-Muslim it had ""given excessive priority to electoral consideration rather than taking decisive action"".He also drew parallels with complaints about anti-Semitism in Labour ranks, warning of parties becoming ""identified by racial or religious lines"".""There are bad eggs in all parties but you don't get the same bad eggs in every party,"" he added."

Consenting sexual activity between men over the age of 21 was only decriminalised in Scotland in 1981. It was a further 20 years before the age of consent for gay men was lowered to 16.The new law will pardon men convicted of having consensual sex with other men before it was decriminalised.It will also enable men to apply to have convictions for same-sex sexual activity that is now legal removed from central criminal conviction records - with the Scottish government saying it expects about 25 men to do so over the next five years. But it will not apply to behaviour that is still illegal today - for example rape or having sex with someone under the age of 16. The Historical Sexual Offences (Pardons and Disregards) Bill has received strong cross-party support since being introduced by the Scottish government in November.At the time, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon offered an ""unequivocal apology"" to men who had been ""convicted as criminals, simply for loving another adult"". She said: ""Those laws criminalised the act of loving another adult, they deterred people from being honest about their identity to family, friends, neighbours and colleagues.""By sending a message from parliament that homosexuality was wrong, they encouraged rather than deterred homophobia and hate.""Nothing that this parliament does can erase those injustices, but I do hope this apology, alongside our new legislation, can provide some comfort to those who endured those injustices.""Before the law changed, men were prosecuted for offences including consensual sexual activity in private, kissing another man in a public place, or just chatting up another man in a public place - which was known as ""importuning"".Such behaviour was legal at the time between a man and a woman, and is legal today between two men.The Equality Network charity estimates that the total number of these historical convictions in Scotland runs into thousands, and that there are hundreds of men alive today with such convictions on their records.Sex between women was never criminalised in this way in Scotland, and the same rules applied to it as applied for sex between a man and a woman.The bill will give an automatic formal pardon to people, both living and dead, who were convicted of historical sexual offences where the conviction was for conduct which is now legal.However, the pardon is a purely symbolic acknowledgement that the laws were discriminatory, and does not reverse the conviction.Anyone with a historical conviction for same-sex sexual activity that is now legal would have to apply for a formal ""disregard"" in order to prevent the information being included in disclosure checks.It would then be up to Scottish ministers to decide, based on the available evidence about the specific case, whether the disregard is granted.A successful disregard application means the conviction will not appear on any background check carried out by Disclosure Scotland, and the person will be treated as not having committed the offence.About 49,000 gay and bisexual men convicted of now-abolished sexual offences in England, Wales and Northern Ireland received posthumous pardons in January last year.Thousands of living men convicted over consensual same-sex relationships were also eligible to apply to have their convictions removed. It followed the pardoning in 2013 of World War Two code-breaker Alan Turing, who had been convicted of gross indecency.Private homosexual acts between men aged over 21 were decriminalised in England and Wales in 1967.The Equality Network says the Scottish legislation does a better job than the equivalent law elsewhere in the UK as it provides an automatic pardon to people who are still alive, and also covers all of the old discriminatory offences."

Over half of recruitment companies could not find the labour even in the ""quiet"" first months of this year, the Association of Labour Providers saysThe National Farmers Union reports that last year there was a 17% drop in seasonal workers coming to the UK. This led to some valuable produce being left to rot in the fields.The strawberry-picking robots doing a job humans won'tNinety-nine percent of seasonal workers on British farms come from Eastern Europe. Two-thirds of these come from Romania and Bulgaria. Kent-based AG Recruitment and Management works in Romania to supply labour for 80 growers across the UK. Over the next few months it needs to find 4,000 people to pick strawberries, raspberries, and eventually apples and pears. The agency is nowhere near that target, and is having to call farmers to say it will not have enough pickers for them.  According to co-director, Estera Amesz, the numbers of people wanting to work in Britain fell sharply after Brexit. A key issue was the fall in the value of the pound. She says it is also down to the uncertainty; people aren't sure what documents they now need.""We used to have queues outside our office in Bucharest. Thirty to 40 people would come a day. Now, on a good day, it's a handful. We used to take the  crème de la crème. Now, we are scraping the barrel."" The firm runs criminal history checks and the candidates do dexterity tests, but Mrs Amesz says her company has had to widen the net. She says she now considers those that, ""have two hands and two legs, and stand a 50% chance of making it"".Rather than people coming to the company offices, they now have to travel deep into the Romanian countryside to sell the idea of coming to work in the UK. At one presentation in the tiny village of Barlad, close to the border with Moldova, 30 people turn up, but only five sign up. Alina Stan, 31, decides to make the journey. She has come to the UK before to pick flowers and fruit. With the money, she's building a house for her and her family. But as soon as she can, she'll stop coming. She says: ""We hope in the next two years to be able to finish our home. But leaving my children behind is very difficult.""According to Doug Amesz, Estera Amesz' husband and business partner: ""We need an incentive. Previously we were looking for people with some English, now we find it difficult to recruit anyone with English.""Romania is one of the poorest countries in Europe. It is one of the largest recipients of EU money. However, almost 30 years after the Romanian Revolution of 1989 and the fall of the communist leader Nicolae Ceausescu, its economy is growing at 6.9%. That's a much faster rate compared to Britain's.  It's creating a newly wealthy middle class. In Iasi, Romania's second city, young people say they have no intention of picking fruit. Puiu Jonut, 23, studies geography. ""The English pick and choose what they want to do and leave the harder jobs for the foreigners,"" he told BBC News. ""There are a lot of English people that could work the fields and not let the fruit rot. That's why Brexit to me was really strange because the foreigners are coming to do the hard jobs and the low-paid jobs - surely you want them to stay.""Growers in Romania are also finding it tough to find pickers. The director of the Research and Development Centre for Fruit Growing in Iasi, Gelu Corneanu, said: ""It's really difficult to find workers to harvest our crops, mainly because they are attracted to other European countries. ""People tend to go and harvest garlic in Spain, then they harvest cherries in Romania and then they harvest strawberries in Greece.""British farmers warned last year of the difficulties they were facing with recruitment, and according to the ALP report, three-quarters of agriculture and horticulture businesses anticipate shortages in low and unskilled roles in 2018. Of these, over a quarter envisage a labour supply crisis. Some farmers have increased wages, bonuses, improved accommodation and other benefits to try to attract more foreign workers to come. The government has pledged to address the issue of whether or not to introduce a scheme to give seasonal workers from further afield special permits to work in the UK, similar to the Seasonal Agricultural Workers Scheme (SAWS) that was closed in 2013. So far, no alternative has been proposed.  In a statement, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, said: ""Defra and the Home Office are working closely to ensure the labour needs of the agriculture sector are met once we leave the EU. ""We have been clear that up until December 2020, employers in the agricultural and food processing sectors will be free to recruit EU citizens to fill vacancies and those arriving to work will be able to stay in the UK afterwards."""

But her fellow Tory MP Maria Caulfield accused campaigners of telling women in Northern Ireland ""that the women in Westminster know best"", saying their campaign ""flies in the face of women's rights and women's choices"".Thank you to all MPs who took part in todays debate.With authority comes responsibility.Message from NI Secretary of State today: NI should take that responsibility.Message from the House of Commons: if you don't, we will.#trustwomenEnd of Twitter post  by @PennyMordauntAfter the debate, Equalities Minister Penny Mordaunt said MPs had sent a message to Northern Ireland's politicians that if they did not act, ""we will"".Following last month's Irish referendum result, Northern Ireland will soon be the only part of either the UK or Ireland where abortion is illegal unless there is a serious risk to a woman's life or health.Labour MP Stella Creasy is leading calls for parts of the 1861 Offences Against the Person Act - the legislation that still governs abortion in Northern Ireland - to be repealed.In 1967, the 1861 act was amended so abortions were legal in England and Wales - but this was not extended to Northern Ireland.Ms Bradley said there were clearly a range of views on the issue.But abortion had ""long been devolved"" she said, and ""it would not be appropriate for Westminster to seek to impose its will"" on Northern Ireland.""Personally I want to see reform in Northern Ireland - but it is a matter for the people of Northern Ireland,"" she said, adding that if the matter came before the House of Commons it would be a ""free vote"" with MPs able to vote with their conscience.Ms Bradley said Ireland's referendum was ""specific to Ireland"" and there were ""significant differences"" with the situation in Northern Ireland.But setting out her case, Ms Creasy - who was backed by MPs from other parties - said the ""impact"" of last month's referendum had been the trigger for the debate.By Gareth Gordon, BBC News NI political correspondentOn one hand, Theresa May's motivation for resisting calls to intervene to change Northern Ireland's abortion laws is obvious - for one thing she does not want to upset the Democratic Unionist Party apple cart.On the other, where will this apparent Conservative revolt (if that's what it is) end - and how big must it grow before she cannot resist it any longer?And then there is the DUP itself. It possesses the ""nuclear button"" of threatening to bring down the government. But press it and we could be looking at (in DUP terms) a post-apocalypse world in which the Labour Party is in power and Jeremy Corbyn is prime minister.Read moreThe Walthamstow MP said: ""150 years is a long time to wait for social justice,"" adding: ""Men and women will never truly be free whilst one cannot control what happens to their own body.""She said she had received abuse online for her campaign, calling her a ""disgrace to humanity"".""Frankly, women get the blame whatever we do in these situations.""Ms Creasy called for the government to offer a date for a vote to test the will of the Commons on the subject.The DUP's Ian Paisley said her proposal would create a ""massive hole"" in the law in Northern Ireland and not allow doctors the right to conscientious objections against abortion.And another DUP MP, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, said law and policy should ""affirm and uphold"" the rights of both mothers and unborn children, paying tribute to Sinn Fein politicians who shared his anti-abortion stance and saying it was ""nonsense"" to say his party was alone in its view.""It is for the people of Northern Ireland through the Northern Ireland Assembly to decide what the law on abortion should be,"" he added.Sinn Fein vice president Michelle O'Neill welcomed the Westminster debate, describing it as a ""first step"" on the road to abortion reform in Northern Ireland."
2018-06-06,Cabinet approves new Heathrow runway,https://web.archive.org//web/20180607005414/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44357580,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowMinisters have described their backing for a new runway at Heathrow Airport as a ""historic moment"" for the UK. The cabinet signed off the plans after they were approved by the government's economic sub-committee, which is chaired by Prime Minister Theresa May.Transport Secretary Chris Grayling announced £2.6bn in compensation for residents and noise abatement measures.Environmental groups oppose the plan, which Mr Grayling says will only happen if air quality commitments are met. ""The time for action is now,"" Mr Grayling told MPs, who will be asked to vote on the expansion plan by 11 July. He insisted the decision was being taken in the national interest and would benefit the whole of the UK - with 15% of new landing slots at the airport ""facilitating"" regional connectivity.He said the £14bn runway, which could be completed by 2026, would be funded entirely privately - but MPs warned that taxpayers would end up footing the bill for billions in road improvements and other upgrades and warned that the UK's carbon emission targets would be threatened by the increase in traffic around the enlarged airport. A decision - finally?The debate on expanding Heathrow has been going on for nearly 20 years. The last Labour government backed the idea, and won a vote on it in 2009, but that plan was scrapped - and the idea of expansion put on hold for five years - by the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition formed after the 2010 election. But the idea of expansion was resurrected and has been subsequently backed by the Conservatives. Ministers approved a draft national airports policy statement in October but Parliament has yet to give its approval for detailed planning to begin. Opponents have threatened a legal challenge while Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, who is MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip in west London, has vowed to ""lie down in front of bulldozers"" to prevent it.The BBC's assistant political editor Norman Smith said ministers whose constituencies would be directly affected might be given a ""get out of a jail card"" - by being allowed to miss the vote or even vote against. No 10 said Mrs May has written to ministers to say those with long-standing objections to a third runway will be permitted to restate their views at a local level, but not to campaign actively against the decision. 'So expensive': Why are critics opposed?Campaigners argue that a new runway will breach the UK's legal limits on air pollution and increase noise pollution with an extra 700 planes a day. It will result in huge disruption to residents of nearby villages, such as Longford, Harmondsworth and Sipson, with hundreds of homes likely to be knocked down. Robert Barnstone, from the No 3rd Runway Coalition, told the BBC it was a ""disappointing"" day and the government was ""failing people and failing the environment as well"". Former Transport Secretary Justine Greening, who backs expanding Gatwick instead, suggested the idea of Heathrow as a national hub airport was outdated and the focus should be on improving regional capacity.""We are now moving to point-to-point travel,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today. ""Why should people who are living in Newcastle spend hours travelling down to London, then fly out somewhere else?""There is nothing national about this national policy statement. It is just a runway in Heathrow.""And Tory MP Zac Goldsmith, who resigned his Richmond Park seat in 2016 over the issue and subsequently lost a by-election, said for many people ""this doesn't just look like a blank cheque being given by this government to a foreign-owned multinational, it looks like a whole book of cheques signed by our constituents"".'Right for UK PLC'Heathrow's owners, which include Spanish infrastructure firm Ferrovial, say the airport is virtually full and a new runway would increase its capacity from 85.5 million to 130 million passengers. The expansion is estimated to create about 60,000 new jobs and generate about £70bn in total economic benefits by the 2050s. Mr Grayling said it would provide a ""vital legacy"" for the British economy and said he had accepted 24 out of the 25 recommendations made by the Transport Select Committee to improve the plans.Residents whose houses are knocked down will get compensation worth 125% of their value - as well as legal fees and stamp duty costs paid for - while £700m would be available to fund noise insulation measures for those who decide to stay.He said a ban on night flights was an ""absolute requirement"" and non-negotiable while he said landing charges paid by airlines must stay at current levels.""This runway cannot be built if it does not meet air quality rules,"" he added.Sir Howard Davies, whose 2015 review recommended a new runway as long as environmental and community impacts were addressed, said ""significant"" concessions had been made on reducing early morning flights and minimising the impact on residents on the proposed flight path.The political battle - by Laura Kuenssberg, BBC political editorYes, the decades-long debate about airports in Britain is returning (it's never gone for long) just at a time when the government is embroiled in rows it will struggle to win. As one cabinet minister joked, ""it's the gift that keeps on giving"".However, with only Boris Johnson having big doubts around the cabinet table, the real rumpus will be in the Parliamentary Tory Party.Plenty of Tory MPs have long held objections to Heathrow and they will be made loudly on the backbenches in the weeks to come. The government doesn't have a majority and remember, it wants to get this plan through the Commons by the end of the month.If they can, it will be a demonstration of ""look, we are getting on with things, it's not just Brexit!""There will be howls, and the process even after this likely vote is a very long one. But the government can expect to get the vote through. Even if Labour opposes it, which it may well do on environmental grounds, the party is also split on the merits of the project so might not all vote together.Read the rest of the blogLabour and the SNP save the day?Labour has said expanded capacity is vital to the UK economy but its support is conditional on tests being met on capacity, climate change, noise and air quality, as well as the wider economic benefits.But there is also a split in opinion when it comes to individual MPs, with shadow chancellor John McDonnell - whose Hayes and Harlington constituency could see homes demolished - says he is ""implacably opposed"". Shadow Transport Secretary Andy McDonald said his party would ""follow the evidence"" and not simply rely on assurances from Mr Grayling: ""If the correct balance is not found then the courts will rightly intervene,"" he said.Leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""Yes, there is a demand for increased airport capacity across the south east, two of the south east airports are working somewhat under capacity, Stansted and Luton. Gatwick and Heathrow are working at pretty well max capacity, let's look at it in that context."" The SNP's Alan Brown said the new runway had the support of the Scottish government, most Scottish airports and Scottish firms who recognised the ""business benefits"". But Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable said the plans were an ""expensive folly"" and his party's 12 MPs would work with others to ""put an end to this project once and for all"". And The Green Party's MP Caroline Lucas said it was a ""disastrous decision"" which ""flew in the face of common sense and climate science"". The carbon questionAs one would expect, there have been contrasting reactions from business and environmental groups.The Institute of Directors said the end of arguments over Heathrow's future was within ""touching distance"".""While the new runway is being built, we also need to make better use of capacity at existing airports in the South East, and indeed the rest of the country,"" said its director general Stephen Martin. But Friends of The Earth said a new runway was not compatible with building a low-carbon economy.""Heathrow expansion would be bad news for our climate and will bring more noise, air pollution and misery to local residents,"" said the organisation's Jenny Bates.

2018-06-06,Brexit: Key dates,https://web.archive.org//web/20180607005414/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44374613,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe countdown to Britain's planned departure from the EU is under way - here are the key dates and parliamentary battles on the road to Brexit.Ratification of the withdrawal agreement by the UK Parliament and the European Parliament. One of the key Brexit laws will return to the House of Commons this week. MPs will have to decide whether to accept or reject changes made to the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill by the House of Lords. Peers inflicted an unprecedented 15 defeats on the government in April and May on issues ranging from a customs union to environmental protection.There has been a lot of debate over whether Theresa May has enough Conservative colleagues onside to avoid damaging defeats on the Withdrawal Bill. But this is just one of the parliamentary hoops the government has to jump through before Brexit day. What is it?A law that will repeal the European Communities Act which brought the UK into the EU in 1972, and copy EU laws and regulations that are currently in force into UK law.It will also give ministers powers to make small changes to laws and regulations without having to bring a whole new bill to Parliament. This is one of the powers that opponents have feared could be open to abuse. When?The bill entered Parliament in July 2017 and has slowly made its way through both the House of Commons and Lords. After the government lost 15 votes on changes to the proposed bill in the Lords, MPs will now debate and vote on the changes. The bill will go back and forth between the two houses until there are no more changes being made, in a process known as ""ping-pong"".Potential flashpointsIf Mrs May's government fails to win enough votes in the Commons, the bill could be passed with some significant conditions attached. One of the most high-profile changes would require the government to report to Parliament on its effort to negotiate a customs union - something that has been ruled out by the PM.Please upgrade your browserWhat are they?In last year's Queen's Speech, the government announced eight Brexit laws that will be needed to prepare the country before it leaves the EU. Some of these have begun their journey through Parliament, but many of them are not even published yet, including a Fisheries Bill, Migration Bill and Agriculture Bill - all areas that will need significant new legislation once we are no longer under European jurisdiction. The two most high-profile are the Trade Bill and the Taxation (Cross-Border Trade) Bill, also known as the Customs Bill. When? Good question. The government has been criticised for its slow progress on key legislation. The Customs and Trade Bills have both passed the first stages in the House of Commons but no date is set for their return, perhaps because the next stage will involve crunch votes on the customs union that Mrs May could lose.Potential flashpointsWhen the Trade Bill returns to the Commons, MPs will vote on an amendment tabled by Conservative MP Anna Soubry. If passed, the amendment would force the government to make it an ""objective"" to take ""all necessary steps"" to set up a customs union between the UK and EU. This is much stronger wording than the amendment to the Withdrawal Bill and defeat would be a significant blow to Mrs May's plans.What is it?MPs will have a vote on the final withdrawal agreement and the framework for the future partnership once they've been negotiated with the EU. This is the ""meaningful vote"" promised to MPs by the prime minister. Brexit Secretary David Davis has said the vote will be on a motion that can be amended and that the government will treat the result as binding.When?Soon after the withdrawal agreement has been finalised (expected by the end of October 2018). Mr Davis has said the vote will take place before the European Parliament votes on the agreement. Potential flashpointsThis is potentially the biggest threat to the government's plans. Ministers have presented the vote as a decision between approving their withdrawal agreement and ""no deal"". If MPs can amend the motion, they could put conditions on the withdrawal agreement. The Lords added an amendment which would potentially give MPs even more power. Under that proposal they could direct the government on how it should act if the withdrawal agreement is rejected.What is it?Another bill that needs to be passed before the UK leaves the EU. It will enshrine the withdrawal agreement in law and give legal effect to whatever transition period is agreed. The difference between this and the motion in Parliament is that the motion is there to approve the withdrawal agreement while the bill is there to implement it. When?The bill cannot be written until there is a withdrawal agreement and it must be passed before Brexit day (29 March 2019). MPs complicated the process in December when they passed an amendment to the Withdrawal Bill - proposed by Conservative MP Dominic Grieve - that would require this bill to be passed before the government can use secondary legislation to implement Brexit. This means the vote on this bill will act as another ""meaningful vote"".Potential flashpointsIt is unclear what would happen if Parliament rejects the Withdrawal and Implementation Bill.What is it?Under the Withdrawal Bill, the government has the power to make changes to laws that need to happen before Brexit day. This is called secondary legislation and is often used to make small technical changes to laws. But opposition politicians have warned that excessive use of these powers could be undemocratic. When?The powers are contained in the Withdrawal Bill. But after MPs voted for Mr Grieve's amendment, ministers will not be allowed to use the powers until the Withdrawal and Implementation Bill has been passed.What is it?The final withdrawal agreement will have to be ratified as an international treaty. The government has to present international treaties to both houses of Parliament. If neither house raises objections, the treaty is passed and does not necessarily have to be debated or voted on. If there is an objection, ministers have 21 days to explain the merits of the treaty, before presenting it to Parliament again. This could technically be repeated multiple times.When?Mr Davis has said the treaty will have to be ratified before the withdrawal agreement can ""enter into force"".Potential flashpointsIt is unlikely that there would be a vote - or even a debate - on the treaty, seeing as the issues will have already been debated and voted on in the meaningful vote. Theoretically, Parliament could vote against the treaty, but it will not be able to amend it.The UK and EU have to agree on the terms of the UK's departure - as well as what sort of trading relationship they will have after Brexit. The UK is hoping an agreement can be reached on both of these elements at the EU summit in October.The government has promised a white paper setting out in detail what it wants from Brexit - but its publication has been delayed while wrangling goes on behind the scenes about what to put in it.There is expected to be a ""political declaration"" on the framework for future UK-EU relations after the October summit. MPs will then be given a vote on the withdrawal agreement before it goes to the European Parliament for ratification.But a number of sticking points remain - and all have to be resolved before the withdrawal agreement can be signed off and put to a vote. Here are the main issues that need to be sorted out (there are a lot of smaller ones too - you can read more about those here).This is the biggest sticking point.Both sides have committed to avoiding the return of a hard border, including physical infrastructure or related checks and controls, between Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.They want to achieve this by agreeing a comprehensive free trade deal with the continuation of open borders.But that could be difficult if the UK government sticks to its policy of leaving the EU single market and customs union.The UK government is working on two possible solutions - a ""customs partnership"", which would see the UK collecting tariffs on behalf of the EU, and ""maximum facilitation"", which would use new technology to track goods passing across the border.The EU has previously rejected both ideas.If all else fails, Brussels has proposed a ""backstop"" solution - which would see Northern Ireland stick to those rules of the customs union and single market that are required for cross-border co-operation to continue.But the UK government is against this idea, saying it would effectively separate Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK and create a border in the Irish Sea.Mrs May also wants an insurance policy to maintain an invisible border if trade talks break down. She is expected to set out details of her ""backstop"" proposal in due course, having seen her previous suggestion rejected by Brussels.The UK has set a lot of store by establishing a high level of co-operation on security issues, like counter-terrorism and the fight against organised crime, with the EU after Brexit. But there are significant disagreements about how this will work - and the EU's decision to exclude the UK from the Galileo satellite system on security grounds has poisoned the atmosphere, with the UK claiming it shows a lack of trust.The UK thinks that co-operation on extradition, the British relationship with the EU crime-fighting agency Europol and the sharing of criminal records should be the subject of a separate security treaty which the two sides should begin negotiating straight away.This is another issue that could bring the whole deal down, according to Michel Barnier.The UK is committed to pulling out of the European Court of Justice, the mechanism used to settle disputes between member states by interpreting and enforcing single market rules.The EU has proposed a joint committee made up of representatives appointed by London and Brussels. If they can't solve a problem, it would be referred to the European Court of Justice.The UK government likes the idea of a joint committee but not of the European Court of Justice having the final say.British companies hold all sorts of personal data belonging to EU citizens, and the European Commission thinks that European data protection laws should continue to apply to it after Brexit.The UK would like a comprehensive deal on data-sharing with the EU as part of the discussions about the future relationship, and is wary of agreeing divorce-related measures that could tie its hands.The EU wants the UK to share customs data for three years and information about certain taxes for five years after the end of the transition period.This is how the Brexit process is meant to go - but the UK or the EU could pull the plug on talks at any time. And, in theory, the UK and the other 27 EU members could agree to change the timetable or even halt the process Brexit altogether.As the European Commission likes to say, ""nothing is agreed until everything is agreed""."
2018-06-06,Paul Dacre steps down,https://web.archive.org//web/20180607005414/https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-44392661,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowSub-editors at the Mail might take against the cliché, but Paul Dacre was the last of his kind.When he entered the profession in the early 1970s, British newspapers had a degree of influence that they do not have now.To a greater extent than has generally been recognised, his experience of Washington and America in the 1970s was formative.David English decided early on that Dacre would be his successor at the Mail, and had the charm to tempt him. Rupert Murdoch wanted him to be editor of The Times, but Dacre declined.At the Mail, he both channelled and shaped the conservatism of middle class Britain beyond London.He felt that these people, whose quiet patriotism and suburban affections he shared, were neglected by the ""liberal metropolitan elite"" - a phrase he did much to popularise, along with ""cultural Marxism"".There remain big questions about his departure: from why now, to what his new role will actually be, and who his successor is. Answers to these may not become clear for some days. At 70, and having been an editor for 26 years, sheer longevity must account for something, and the logic of what probably ought to happen at the Mail - editorial savings, synergies with Mail Online, and so on - have caused stress for all newspaper chiefs.Dacre is hated by many of his fellow countrymen, though social media may amplify negative feelings, and the verdict of millions of readers who considered his paper value for money for decades should not be forgotten.Print journalism is a trade rather than a profession - and within it, Dacre was the master craftsman. He had an obsessive eye for detail, and often said he thought he was a better re-write man than reporter. Colleagues, including those with very different politics, respected his intuitive understanding of his audience. It is reasonable to claim that Brexit was in part his doing, because it followed years of campaigning against the EU, and warnings - sometimes lurid - about immigration.Few people now remember that both the Standard and the Mail were pro-EU before he took their helms.Other Dacre-led campaigns garnered support from across the political spectrum.The pursuit of justice for Stephen Lawrence was the best-known; but the campaigns for relatives of victims of the Omagh bombing, for Gary McKinnon, and more recently against plastic bags have had a huge impact.Dacre also led objections to the system of regulation of the press recommended by Lord Leveson, and desired by many victims of press abuse.Though he oversaw the launch of both Metro and Mail Online, his involvement in both is complex.On Metro, he ensured that it didn't have the editorial power to compromise the Mail's circulation.On Mail Online, he cannot have helped but notice that many of the editorial values of the Mail were absent. Prime ministers and politicians fawned before him, but he often regarded them as irritants.David Cameron never impressed him. Ken Clarke, who the Mail backed to be Tory leader, came to embody a Europhilia Dacre disdained.And while he loathed much of Blairism, including its figurehead, he found in Gordon Brown - who he once described as ""touched by the mantle of greatness"" - a genuine friend. Dacre's editorship of the Mail was testimony to the power of newspapers within a culture. As they - and he - retreat from centre stage, it's not yet clear what will replace them.If you're interested in issues such as these, please follow me on Twitter or Facebook; and also please subscribe to The Media Show podcast from Radio 4. I'm grateful for all constructive feedback. Thanks."
2018-06-06,Stop Brexit campaign,https://web.archive.org//web/20180607005414/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44331013,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowBest for Britain is this week launching a national campaign to stop Brexit. Who is behind it?Best for Britain aims to persuade MPs to back a referendum on the final Brexit deal secured by Theresa May when they vote on it in the autumn, with staying in the EU an option on the ballot paper.It would aim to persuade enough Leave voters to change their mind to vote to keep Britain in the EU - but the first stage of its campaign aims to generate pressure for another referendum.Its campaign slogan - already displayed on billboards in London, Birmingham, Manchester and Liverpool and in newspaper ads - is ""We all deserve a final say on the Brexit deal.""According to the Observer, Best for Britain will send a ""roadmap"" to MPs and peers, setting out how they could stop Brexit, when it launches its campaign on Friday. The group believes a referendum could be held in December, or possibly as late as February or March - when the UK is set to officially quit the EU - if Brussels agrees to it.It is targeting much of its campaigning muscle at the Labour Party's front bench, which is against another referendum - but it also needs at least 10 Conservative ""rebels"" on board in order to win a vote in Parliament on an amendment calling for a referendum.The campaign is also attempting to shore up support among Labour backbenchers sceptical about Brexit and is reportedly targeting 50 Leave-supporting Labour constituencies with billboard ads close to MPs' offices. The campaign will also lobby the big trade unions in an effort to exert pressure on the Labour leadership and is running a social-media campaign and a ""Labour Against Brexit"" speaking tour by leading Labour Remainers. It is also funding a grassroots campaign and has handed cash to local volunteers to ""help stop Brexit in your area"". Best for Britain was set up in April 2017, just before June's snap general election. Its initial aim was to encourage tactical voting to try to get more pro-Remain MPs into the House of Commons. The group said more than a million people had consulted its tactical voting website ahead of 8 June to find pro-Remain candidates.It reported spending £353,118 between June 2016 and June 2017, and made donations to pro-European candidates in marginal seats, including the Lib Dems' Tom Brake, Labour's Peter Kyle and Green MP Caroline Lucas. One of the group's founding members, Gina Miller, defeated the government over its power to trigger Article 50 without parliamentary consent, in the Supreme Court in January 2017. However, she stood down the day after the 2017 general election, saying the group had become too party political.Officially registered as UK-EU Open Policy Limited, Best for Britain is led by business and charity sector figures. This is in contrast to the MP-led People's Vote campaign - which is also pushing for a referendum on the final Brexit deal, although the two campaigns will join forces on 23 June to stage a march on Parliament.Best for Britain has £2.4m in its coffers and is asking donors for another £3.2m to realise its campaigning ambitions, according to its director of communications, Paul Butters, a former spokesman for Tim Farron, the ex-Liberal Democrat leader.The biggest individual donor is international financier George Soros, a Hungarian-born US citizen, who has given Best for Britain £800,000 in total so far, with £400,000 of that coming since the start of the year through his pro-European Open Society Foundation.Having made his billions in finance, including betting against sterling on Black Wednesday in 1992 - which gained him a reputation as the ""man who broke the Bank of England"" - Mr Soros, 87, donated more than £8bn to philanthropic causes between 1979 and 2011.UK electoral law bans foreign donations but only in the run-up to elections or referendums. Best for Britain says it has not taken money from overseas because the Soros donations came via his Open Society Foundations UK branch. The campaign is also keen to stress that it has also raised significant sums from more than 8,000 small donors.But the involvement of Mr Soros has generated a backlash in the Brexit-backing media, with the Daily Mail telling him on its front page: ""Butt out Mr Soros. You can keep your tainted money.""Mr Soros hit back at the Daily Mail's headline in an article for the Mail on Sunday, explaining why his love for Britain had led him to campaign against the ""tragic mistake"" of Brexit - and the campaign launched a Gofundme crowdfunding page entitled Help Best for Britain fight the Daily Mail, which has raised more than £64,000 in the past 12 days.Pro-Brexit campaign Leave Means Leave is, meanwhile, raising funds to combat Best for Britain, with its co-chairman John Longworth telling supporters in an email: ""We are determined to secure the swift, clean Brexit you all voted for.""Best for Britain is currently under investigation by the Electoral Commission, which oversees campaign spending, for submitting a return with invoices missing and for failing to return a donation of £25,000 from an impermissible donor within 30 days. It says it has complied with all relevant regulations.Lord Malloch-Brown, appointed 2 November 2017. A former foreign office minister, under Gordon Brown, who became a life peer in July 2007. Before that, he served as UN deputy secretary general, and from 1977 to 1979 he was a political correspondent at the pro-EU Economist, returning in 1983 for three years as founding editor of the Economist Development Report.The 64-year-old peer sparked controversy when he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme last month that Britain might as well stay in the EU, given the impossibility of divorcing itself from the Continent's problems. He said: ""Britain's history as an island nation adjacent to mainland Europe is when we try to, sort of, pull away from Europe's problems and close ourselves off to them, they have a horrible habit of infecting us anyway - appeasement in the 1930s, you name it. For centuries, Britain has ignored events on continental Europe at its peril.""Chief executive officer: Eloise Todd, 41. Until December 2016, Ms Todd worked in Brussels as global director of U2 singer Bono's anti-poverty charity, One. She had worked in the European Parliament for seven years after graduating from the College of Europe in Bruges.The Guardian has suggested that it was her personal connection to Best for Britain's biggest donor, George Soros, through the international development sector, that attracted him to the group, instead of better-known campaigns such as Open Britain, which is now part of the People's Vote group.Director: Sir Clive Cowdery, appointed 16 December 2016. The insurance businessman founded the Resolution Foundation think tank in 2005. He was chairman and chief executive of General Electric Insurance Holdings from 1998 to 2003.

2018-06-06,Voting marathon,https://web.archive.org//web/20180607005414/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44357101,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowEven at lunchtime today, a former minister stalking the green and gold corridors of this place, made a familiar moan, ""there's nothing happening in this place"".MPs complain often ""we have hardly anything to do"", so few new draft laws are actually being put forward, so little do they have to scrutinise and then vote on. Suggest that to the government and it would push back pretty strongly, even if some ministers might raise an eyebrow while doing so. But next Tuesday isn't going to be like that at all with a marathon session of Brexit business back in the Commons. The Lords beat the government fifteen times on its EU Withdrawal Bill, forcing changes to ministers' plans. The government will try to unpick those alterations. So while it's hard to know precisely how many votes there will be, there will be a lot, and it is certainly unusual to have them all in one day. The bill passed its first hurdle in the Commons a few months ago, but the House of Lords then made plenty of nips and tucks, or amendments, on how customs should work after Brexit, on the Irish border, on whether we should stay in a different free trade area, the EEA, and plenty of other issues besides.What the government wants is to undo the changes the Lords made to the bill.But it is far from clear that they can rely on the votes in the Commons to do so. For many weeks potential Tory rebels who want a closer relationship with the EU after Brexit, have been planning how they might vote - this could be the moment then they gang together to beat the government. They are confident that they could do so if they choose to, one of them said to me today, ""some of us just are starting to think we have to fill in the gaps"" trying to force the prime minister's hand to make up for what some see as the absence of leadership, saying No 10 has an ""untenable lack of strategy, and it's running out of road"".Whether in the end they have the guts to do so next Tuesday, there's already a row. After months of a relatively quiet Parliament, trying to ram 15 votes through on the bill in one day is not exactly giving MPs time and space for debate. Some around here are crying foul already. Surely the whips aren't trying to squeeze out dissent in the Remain camp?  Perish the thought. But it's worth noting on the Eurosceptic side there's satisfaction that the bill is at last returning to the Commons, and the votes all take place in one day - ""bish bash bosh"" - as one source described it.There's the possibility that the bill, with losses or victories for the government will speed straight back to the lords within days. Next week there certainly will not be the case that ""there's nothing happening"".PS: While Parliament is going to sound very divided in the next ten days, if you have been following the Customs debate in particular - which I know I have probably written about far too much - there is a sense, not of an answer, but of a developing compromise. Two Cabinet ministers have told me now that they expect the prime minister to end up in a position where she plumps for the revised 'max fac' proposal, but has to admit it won't be ready for years. One of them today suggested the most likely outcome would be to move to a new 'Customs Partnership' at the end of the Brexit Implementation Period, then to 'max fac' once the technology has been developed in years to come. What Brussels will make of it is a different question. And with the Brexit White Paper possibly delayed until after the June summit, it is possible that the government still doesn't come up with its solution on this until July. PPS: If that's one compromise, here's another potential one. Open Europe, the think tank that is officially neutral but that has close links to Eurosceptics has published a paper putting forward a possible compromise for the future economic relationship with the EU. In essence, the UK would stay closely tied to the EU in terms of goods, but go our own way on services. Nothing about this is easy, and again, Brussels has always pushed back at the idea of splitting up any sectors. But it has gathered quite a bit of attention and support around Westminster, and it's worth a read. Click here to read it.  "
2018-06-06,The great survivor,https://web.archive.org//web/20180607005414/https://www.bbc.com/news/health-40162245,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHe has overseen worsening waiting times for cancer care, hospital operations and emergency treatment. Hospitals have bust their budgets by record amounts. And there has been the first all-out strike by doctors. But despite all this, Jeremy Hunt has remained as health secretary in England.With five years and 274 days under his belt, he is the longest-serving custodian of the NHS, having surpassed Margaret Thatcher's Health Minister, Norman Fowler, and Aneurin Bevan, the man who set up the health service in the first place. How has he survived so long?To understand Mr Hunt's reign, you need to go back to the start. He was appointed, in September 2012, because he was seen as a skilled communicator who could help articulate a clear vision for the health service after the furore over the changes implemented by his predecessor, Andrew Lansley.Mr Hunt immediately took a different tack - and it is one that has come to shape his time as health secretary. One of his first moves as health secretary was to go on holiday with his family. It had already been booked, following the London Olympics and a tricky period as culture secretary during which he had become embroiled in row over his relationship with Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.While on holiday, he read the report into the Stafford Hospital scandal, which Sir Robert Francis had just finished. Those close to him said the findings had horrified him. It was not just the poor care and suffering that had happened, but that it had been allowed to go on so long without the alarm being raised.He came back convinced he needed to champion patient safety. In the following years, he went on to overhaul the inspection regime, introduce a new duty of candour on staff and fresh rules about whistle-blowers.Someone working with him at the time told me this was ""classic Jeremy"". They said: ""He likes to pick a central theme and focus on it relentlessly. It is how he believes you get things done in government.""In the speeches I've heard over the years, he runs through the stories of those who have suffered. People such as:It is powerful stuff. These are the very worst examples of NHS care. They should never have happened. And only his harshest critics would disagree with what he says about them. Mr Titcombe has said the health secretary's efforts should be applauded. He believes he has ""changed the game when it comes to patient safety"".""I watched my son die. And then I watched the NHS close ranks afterwards,"" Mr Titcombe said. ""[Mr Hunt] was [one of] the few people who listened. And he took action.""But what has annoyed many who work in the NHS is the way he has gone about tackling the problem. They feel he has blamed them and questioned their professionalism at a time when his government has overseen the toughest funding settlement the NHS has ever had.Nowhere is this clearer than in his handling of the junior-doctor contract row. Emboldened by the election victory in 2015, Mr Hunt returned to office determined to achieve the manifesto commitment of creating a seven-day NHS and - as a result, he argued - safer care for patients.He was markedly more aggressive than he had been in his first two and a half years in post. He criticised what he said was a ""Monday to Friday"" culture, prompting an outpouring of anger. On social media, medics started posing photographs of themselves at work using the hashtag #ImInWorkJeremy.The clash set the tone for a difficult few months for the health secretary. Contract negotiations with junior doctors had already started and stalled. And the stalemate soon worsened, with the British Medical Association balloting for industrial action. After months of wrangling, junior doctors took part in a series of walkouts, two of which involved all-out strikes where emergency care was not covered - the first time that had ever happened in the NHS.Mr Hunt acknowledges this was his most difficult time as health secretary. And while he remains unapologetic for taking on the BMA, which he says was spreading misinformation about the contract, he accepts he should have done more to tackle one major complaint of doctors - rota gaps.Since the dispute, he has announced increases in training places for both doctors and nurses. Following the strikes, Mr Hunt's approval rating actually dropped lower than predecessor Andrew Lansley's had at the height of his troubles.And by the time Theresa May became prime minister, in the summer of 2016, there was strong speculation that he was going to lose his job.In fact, on the morning of her first reshuffle, there were reports he had actually been sacked but then reinstated when it had become clear not all the people Ms May had earmarked for posts in her first cabinet had been willing to take up the offer.This has been denied by Mr Hunt and his team - and certainly the health secretary had the last laugh by tweeting on the day: ""Reports of my death have been greatly exaggerated."" The mere fact he has survived so long in one of the most demanding posts in government means speculation about his future is a given. Ahead of the last election, reports surfaced that Ben Gummer, who has served as a junior minister under Mr Hunt, had been earmarked as the next health secretary.But Mr Gummer lost his seat. And, with Theresa May left weakened following the election, there was limited change in the cabinet. Indeed, some began to see Mr Hunt's longevity as a benefit to the government during a period when NHS waiting times have worsened and attracted negative headlines.Norman Lamb, a former Liberal Democrat health spokesman and a minister in the coalition, once described him as the ""shock absorber"", able to take the flak for the government.But as he has gone on and with the NHS in its 70th year, there is a sense attitudes towards Mr Hunt have begun to change again.At the last reshuffle, in the winter, it is understood he was offered the job of business secretary but this time had the confidence to tell the prime minister he wanted to stay where he was.Even among his critics, this news was met with a grudging acceptance. There is, it seems, a growing feeling - even among those who have wished him out in the past - that it is better to have someone in post who understands the health service and has the power to argue for it at the cabinet table than a newcomer.Behind the scenes, Mr Hunt was championing the need for a long-term funding settlement in late 2017 - and the fact that the prime minister has now committed to that is in large part down to his influence.Discussions about how big a rise the NHS should receive continue. But by all accounts Mr Hunt is pushing back against the Treasury, which seems to want to offer only an extra 2% a year when economists are arguing it will need to be nearer 4% if the NHS is to remain in good health.How he fares in those discussions could well shape his legacy as health secretary.Read more from NickFollow Nick on Twitter"

People have a sense that no-one is talking about the people outside the capital. In the EU referendum, the Leave campaign's slogan 'take back control' cut through for that reason.""Nearly three quarters of over-65s  are proud to be English compared with fewer than half of those aged 18 to 24.Mr Denham said: ""Young people will tend to be less patriotic than older people wherever they are, whether that's England, Scotland or Wales.""They will have a more cosmopolitan view of the world. And in the younger generation there are more people from black and minority ethnic groups who are more likely to identify as British than as English.""It doesn't mean that Englishness and English pride is disappearing, but we are looking at a future where both Britishness and Englishness will mean a lot to a lot of people.""Being born in England makes someone English according to eight out of 10 people surveyed.Living in England for less than five years qualifies someone as English in the minds of just 14% of those who responded.For just over a third of people (38%) considering yourself English is enough and trumps even living in England for 10 or more years or even being able to speak English.A sense of humour, tradition, manners and fair play are characteristics most people surveyed associate with being English.Although more than half of respondents consider strongly that generosity and plain-speaking were part of the English identity, less than half think the English are a liberal, outward-looking people. And less than four in 10 consider Englishness to be defined by ""yob culture"". Only one in four consider the English to be a ""loud"" people.""So-called yob culture is not such a dominant image of Englishness as some people think,"" said Mr Denham.""If you see footage of English football fans smashing up a town square, you're going to think about yob culture at the time, but most people associate Englishness with much more positive values most of the time.

2018-06-06,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20180607005414/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks  have now moved on to future relations - after agreement was reached on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are just beginning. Both sides hope they can agree within six months on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all.  Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide, but first let's go back to the basics...It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro.Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.5%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand near a 40-year year low of 4.3%. Annual house price increases have fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 4.9% in the year to January 2018, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May is seeking to put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. If passed, it will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, is supposed to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said continued membership of the single market has to be an option in negotiations with Brussels.   Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The single market is a very different beast - it is not just about the trade in goods. It allows the free movement of people, money and services as if the EU was a single country.Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each playing roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border check for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanAn agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement.The full details are not yet known but UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72.We don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pounds buy fewer euros. A slump in the value of the dollar means the exchange rate with the pound is pretty close to where it was before the referendum.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.A method for calculating the bill has been agreed, but the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more.The question of how and when payments will be made still needs to resolved, but it will be a schedule lasting for many years to come, and it is highly unlikely that anyone will ever be able to give an exact figure for the size of the divorce bill.UK sources say it will be up to £40bn, but some EU sources expect it to be higher than that. No-one can say for sure, and both sides want to keep it that way.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 6.5% in 2016 to 2.7% in 2017, according to the Halifax. It said the slowdown was driven by a squeeze on real wage growth.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-06-06,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180607005414/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to £840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

As I write, Mrs May is holed up with her advisers inside Tory HQ. But a former minister Anna Soubry has called for her to ""consider her position"" - political code for calling for her to resign.

On the two previous occasions in 1970 and February 1974 the PM and the party lost office. While there is no other conceivable administration in the new parliament other than a Conservative-led one, it remains to be seen whether the PM will retain her position. However, so long as the Conservatives can reach an accommodation with the DUP they will have a working majority in the House of Commons.  BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed:When the general election exit poll was revealed at 10pm, the pound immediately dropped by 2% as investors took a position that a hung parliament was a possible outcome of the general election.Why would that cause the currency to decline? Because a hung parliament means that the government's direction of travel would be less certain.

of 2021 - was included in it.It followed crunch meetings between Prime Minister Theresa May and Brexit Secretary David Davis, who insisted a cut-off date be included.The proposal would see the UK match EU trade tariffs temporarily in order to avoid a hard Irish border post-Brexit.Brexiteers want to ensure the backstop could not continue indefinitely.Responding on Twitter, EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier set out the criteria on which he would judge the UK's proposal, including the need for a ""workable solution"" to avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland.The European Parliament's Brexit co-ordinator Guy Verhofstadt went further, saying it was ""difficult to see"" how this could be achieved.""A backstop that is temporary is not a backstop, unless the definitive arrangement is the same as the backstop,"" he added.The UK is due to leave the EU in March 2019, and the government is trying to make progress before a crucial meeting of EU leaders later this month.BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said Mr Davis had ""pushed back very hard"" against the proposals on Wednesday and had two meetings with the prime minister on Thursday before a deal was agreed.After the publication, Mr Davis's chief of staff said there had been a ""helpful dialogue"" and that the document had now been ""clarified and amended"".According to the document - which has yet to be agreed with the EU - the ""temporary customs arrangement"", if it is needed, would be ""time-limited"".A long-term ""future customs arrangement"" will be in place ""by the end of December 2021 at the latest"", it says.Another cabinet Brexiteer Liam Fox, who also met the prime minister on Thursday, told the BBC: ""As everybody knows from the referendum, opinions and feelings run high on this issue but we've shown we can reach an agreement civilly and collectively.""The Brexit secretary claimed a victory, but in Westminster what starts out as a ""win"" can, by morning, seem like a hollow victory, writes BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg.Senior figures in government are questioning whether David Davis really achieved very much.He may have saved face after making a huge fuss but look carefully at the concession he won, they say, and it doesn't really mean very much.A few words here, a loosening up of the planned language there, perhaps the victory really was Theresa May's?Read the rest of Laura's blogPlease upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK has said it will leave the EU's customs union, which allows trade within the EU without any tariffs or many border checks.The UK and the EU are yet to agree how trade in goods will operate after Brexit - but they have said that a ""backstop"" option is needed in case no deal is done, or the technology is not ready in time, to avoid the return of a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.The UK has said that the EU's initial ""backstop"" proposal - effectively keeping Northern Ireland in the customs union - would create what amounted to a border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK and was not acceptable.Instead, the UK is proposing a backup plan which would see the whole of the UK temporarily aligned with the EU's customs union after December 2020 - when the 21-month post-Brexit transition period ends.The plan, which Theresa May has said would only apply in a ""limited set of circumstances"", would see the UK match EU tariffs in order to avoid border checks.Please upgrade your browserWith the EU sceptical about the two options the UK has suggested to replace its membership of the customs union - and government ministers yet to agree which one to pursue - the backstop is ""rapidly becoming the only option on the table"", former Brexit minister David Jones told the BBC, ""so it must be got right"".He said not having a firm time limit would be ""damaging to the country"": ""It would tie us effectively into the the EU's customs arrangement for an indefinite period"".It would prevent the UK from having its own independent trade policy, he said - customs union members are not allowed to strike their own international trade deals.It would also mean the UK was still under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, which would be unacceptable to most Conservative MPs, he added.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler""Wow,"" gushed a European journalist to me the other day, ""normally we look to Italy for political drama and uncertainty but the UK is making a pretty good show of it.""So dizzying and confused is the news coming out of the UK about how the EU-UK relationship could and should work after Brexit, that EU negotiators say they are forced to stand on the sidelines while the British government talks and argues with itself.""It just can't work,"" an EU diplomat told me in exasperation this week. ""Theresa May has so many nooses dangling around her neck that one of those nooses is sure to hang her.""Read Katya's blogBBC Brussels reporter Adam Fleming says the EU will apply a series of tests to any proposal about customs from the UK, including how it would interact with the EU's own customs policy, whether it would require the EU to change its rules, and what would happen when new ones were introduced? The UK government said its latest proposals would deliver on a commitment, made in December, to avoid creating a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, which is an EU member.In response, Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said it was ""vital"" that a legally-binding backstop was found to prevent a hard border.""Clearly, a great deal of work remains to be done and this needs to be the highest priority for all sides in the weeks ahead.""Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, whose support Theresa May relies on for a Commons majority, welcomed the proposal, saying the EU's version of a backstop had been ""totally unacceptable"".""We must also remember that the backstop will only be used as a last resort,"" said the DUP's Nigel Dodds.""The focus must now be on getting a new trade deal.""Labour MP Hilary Benn, who chairs the Commons Brexit committee, said the government's plans would effectively keep the UK in a customs union with the EU beyond the end of 2020."

Air Chief Marshal Sir Stuart Peach said IS was a ""really wicked and evil enemy"" that used civilians as human shields. He said the RAF had carried out ""the most carefully planned air campaign in history"" and was ""meticulous"" in trying to avoid civilian casualties.Amnesty International has criticised the UK for its role in attacks on the Syrian city of Raqqa.It claimed that the US-led coalition had been responsible for killing hundreds of civilians in Raqqa alone and it called on the Ministry of Defence to ""come clean"" over Britain's role. But Air Chief Marshal Peach, who earlier in his career served as a navigator in a Tornado jet, does not accept the charge.He said any allegation of civilian harm, with evidence of time and place, was properly investigated.RAF strikes 'have killed more than 3,000 IS fighters'Army ads 'won't appeal to new soldiers'Islamic State: The full storyHe has overseen the battle against IS as chief of the defence staff for the past two years. Next week he moves to Brussels to take on a new job as chairman of Nato's Military Committee - providing advice to secretary general Jens Stoltenberg. In a valedictory interview with BBC News, Air Chief Marshal Peach highlighted some of the challenges he has faced as the most senior British military officer, including recruitment. The regular Army is more than 10,000 soldiers short of its target strength of 82,000 and he admitted he was ""worried"" about the numbers, saying they presented a ""challenge to do better"". He suggested that part of the problem was an ""unfortunate characterisation"" of how the armed forces were often portrayed. ""We're not all heroes and we're certainly not all victims"", he said, adding that the vast majority who served were ""enriched"" by their life in uniform. His own origins are humble - as the son of an Army sergeant major. Educated in a state grammar school, he was the first in his family to go to university and describes the RAF as a meritocracy with a long history of taking people from disadvantaged backgrounds.  But he acknowledged the military still had ""a problem"" with few women in senior posts. They now make up 10.4% of the regular armed forces - but just 3.4% of senior officers are women. Air Chief Marshal Peach said that was being addressed with all branches of the armed forces opened up to them, including infantry roles, as well as more flexible working patterns.He said he was ""very confident"" that in the next 10 to 20 years there would be a female chief of the defence staff. Another potential stumbling block to recruitment and retention has been the shadow of potential legal action against serving and former military personnel involved in past conflicts - from Northern Ireland to Iraq and Afghanistan.Air Chief Marshal Peach said he was ""very uncomfortable"" about these historic allegations. Some MPs have called for a statute of limitations to protect veterans who might be accused of past abuses but the defence staff chief said that was a ""political call, not a military one"". The next chief of the defence staff, General Sir Nicholas Carter, has been left with another big challenge and that is the funding of the armed forces. Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson is making the case for a rise in defence spending at a time of rising threats.Air Chief Marshal Peach points to the chemical attack in Salisbury as well as cyber attacks which he says are ""becoming more regular, almost routine"". He says ""Russia is a concern"" - that concern will occupy his mind as he moves on to his new job in Brussels. It's the Nato alliance, he says, that provides collective security for Britain. "
2018-06-07,Supreme Court rejects NI abortion law case,https://web.archive.org//web/20180608010853/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-44395150,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHuman rights campaigners have lost a Supreme Court appeal over the legality of Northern Ireland's abortion law.The court dismissed an appeal brought by the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission (NIHRC).But a majority of judges said the existing law was incompatible with human rights law in cases of fatal foetal abnormality and sexual crime.Unlike other parts of the UK, the 1967 Abortion Act does not extend to Northern Ireland.Currently, a termination is only permitted in Northern Ireland if a woman's life is at risk or if there is a risk of permanent and serious damage to her mental or physical health. The commission lost on the issue of whether they had the required standing to bring the case, and analysts suggest the defeat came because of a technical legal point.By Marie-Louise Connolly, BBC News NI health correspondentWhat a bizarre set of circumstances. On the one hand, the case was dismissed while, on the other, a majority of Supreme Court judges said that Northern Ireland's abortion law is not compatible with human rights. So where does that leave Northern Ireland? While the case's dismissal means the government is not obliged to change the law, the seven judges have given a strong nod that reform is needed. A very clear message from the Supreme Court to all politicians in Westminster and NI - action is now required over NI’s abortion law which court ruled is incompatible with human rights legislation. @BBCNewsNI pic.twitter.com/v7M2UyrRiSEnd of Twitter post  by @mlchealthIs this a victory for those who want change? They would argue so, because a majority of judges said the state of the law is ""deeply unsatisfactory"". Those are significant words. However, those who argue the law should stay the same will take comfort that the majority of judges agreed the NIHRC didn't have the right to bring the case. While a clear-cut decision would have been welcomed, that hasn't happened. For those at the heart of this - women and medics - the dilemma remains. The Supreme Court judges said it would have required the case to have been brought by a woman who was pregnant as a result of sexual crime or who was carrying a foetus with a fatal abnormality. A fatal foetal abnormality diagnosis means doctors believe an unborn child has a terminal condition and will die in the womb or shortly after birth, although anti-abortion campaigners have argued that terminally-ill babies ""can and do defy the odds"".As a result, the judges did not make a formal declaration of incompatibility, which would normally lead to a change in the law.The ruling comes just weeks after the Republic of Ireland voted decisively in a referendum to reform the country's strict abortion laws, which had effectively banned all terminations.The referendum reignited a debate about Northern Ireland's law, with some calling for reform while others - including the biggest party, the Democratic Unionist Party - remain opposed to changing the law. The NICHR had argued that the current law subjects women to ""inhuman and degrading"" treatment, causing ""physical and mental torture,"" in violation of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).Lord Kerr said that, by a majority of five to two: ""The court has expressed the clear view that the law of Northern Ireland on abortion is incompatible with article 8 of the Convention in relation to cases of fatal foetal abnormality and by a majority of four to three that it is also incompatible with that article in cases of rape and incest"".He added that while this was not a binding decision, ""it must nevertheless be worthy of close consideration by those"" who decide the law. Any change in the law will now be up to the politicians, either in Belfast or Westminster.Northern Ireland has been without an executive since January 2017, when the governing parties - the DUP and Sinn Féin - split in a bitter row over a flawed green energy scheme.Prime Minister Theresa May has previously said that a government in Northern Ireland should deal with the issue.Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley, responding to an urgent question in the House of Commons, said the government is ""carefully considering"" the judgement.""The analysis and comments from the court on the issue of incompatibility will be clearly heard by this house and politicians in Northern Ireland,"" she said. Les Allamby, from NIHRC, said it was ""disappointed"" at the ruling but that it fell to the UK government to change Northern Ireland's law ""without delay"". Grainne Taggart, from Amnesty International, said the ruling was a ""very important and long overdue vindication of women's rights in Northern Ireland"".""All eyes are now on Theresa May and her government. She cannot allow women in Northern Ireland to suffer on her watch,"" she added.Fellow campaigner Sarah Ewart said she was ""extremely relieved that the court recognised there has been a breach of human rights for women who go through a situation of a fatal foetal abnormality"".Ms Ewart has campaigned for a change to Northern Ireland's law in cases of fatal foetal abnormality after she travelled to England for an abortion in 2013 after being told her unborn child would not survive outside the womb.Peter Lynas, from anti-abortion group Both Lives Matter said he welcomed the ruling and the recognition in the judgement that there is no right to abortion based on serious foetal malformation. The case is the latest in a long line of legal challenges to Northern Ireland's abortion law. Figures released on Thursday morning show that 919 women travelled from Northern Ireland to England for an abortion last year, a rise from 724 in 2016."

However, that figure still falls below the UK university average of 25%.The most recent UK census showed 14% of the UK population identifies as black or minority ethnic.Data in the university's report showed that, of the students who achieved three 'A' grades or higher in their A-levels nationwide, 20% identified as black and minority ethnic."
2018-06-07,'More women needed' at select committees,https://web.archive.org//web/20180608010853/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44386805,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowMore women should give evidence to select committees to ensure diverse views are heard, a committee has said. Figures collected by the Liaison Committee show only 33% of witnesses over the past year have been women.Whilst the figure is up on the previous two years - 29% in 2016/17 and 28% in 2015/16 - the committee wants more progress to be made.A target of at least 40% female ""discretionary witnesses"" has been set by the end of this parliament. Discretionary witnesses are individuals invited to give evidence, rather than ""non-discretionary witnesses"" - people who hold a particular position, such as ministers or senior officials. MPs on the committee say the government needs to appoint more women to public office to address the continued gender imbalance among non-discretionary witnesses as well.In the past year, 37% of discretionary witnesses - up from 32% in 2016/17 - and 27% of non-discretionary witnesses - up from 24% in 2016-17 - were women.The liaison committee is made up of the chairs of 36 other parliamentary committees The chair of the liaison committee, Sarah Wollaston, said: ""Just as it is important to aim for a gender balanced parliament, so too that needs to be reflected in the diversity of the witnesses invited to give evidence at select committees. ""By focusing on this issue we hope that all committees will make further progress towards equal representation on both sides of select committee tables.""   A report from the committee recommends that panels with three or more witnesses should include at least one woman - unless there are ""compelling reasons"" for an all-male panel. It also pledged to continue monitoring gender balance, with the next set of figures due to be published in December. Liaison Committee member Maria Miller, said: ""Select committee inquiries rely on top quality evidence that brings together a range of views - that includes women's views. ""Important progress is being made but, whilst all male panels are almost a thing of the past, still only one in three witnesses giving oral evidence is female."" Ms Miller, who also chairs the Women and Equalities Committee, called on organisations to ""think more about the diversity of the witnesses they send to give evidence"". A number of committees have taken part in a voluntary pilot to monitor the diversity of their panels, asking witnesses for information on their gender identity, age, disability, ethnic background, religion and sexual orientation."

The Commons unanimously approved a motion demanding Mr Cummings agree to appear before the Digital, Culture Media and Sport Committee on or before 20 June, as part of its inquiry into ""fake news"". Mr Cummings has argued that there are ""legal issues"" about him answering questions, because of a separate inquiry by the Electoral Commission.But Mr Collins said there was ""a certain irony"" that someone who had run a successful campaign to restore powers to Parliament ""seems to hold that institution in such contempt"".He said there were ""important questions"" for Mr Cummings to answer about the EU referendum campaign and, in reference to Mr Cummings's complaints about other investigations by the Electoral Commission and Information Commissioner, said the matter was not ""sub judice"" and Mr Cummings was not before the courts.""His decision not to come, whatever he says, is one of his own making. It's a deliberate attempt to deny Parliament its right to question witnesses on matters of importance,"" Mr Collins said.He added it was ""the first time since 1920 that a motion of this kind has been put before this House"".Hilary Benn, who chairs another select committee said if potential witnesses began to think ""'I don't have to turn up,' then how can we continue to do our job .... in holding the powerful to account?"" and suggested legislation be drafted to deal with people who refused to attend.The motion was backed by Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom. And Conservative MP Dr Sarah Wollaston, who also chairs a select committee, called Mr Cummings's actions ""a disgrace"" and agreed with Mr Benn that it was time to consider introducing a penalty for witnesses refusing to appear. It had been reported that Mr Cummings had intended to come to the Commons while the issue was being debated, but he was not in the public gallery for the debate. So: it seems that Dominic Cummings has decided not to come to Parliament to watch MPs debate his decision not to come to Parliament.End of Twitter post  by @Susanh12He has accused the DCMS committee of ""grandstanding"" and wrote in response to a letter from Mr Collins: ""I'm calling your bluff. Your threats are as empty as those from [Prime Minister Theresa May, Chancellor Philip Hammond and Brexit Secretary David Davis] to the EU. Say what you like, I will not come to your committee regardless of how many letters you send or whether you send characters in fancy dress to hand me papers.""If another committee behaves reasonably and I can give evidence without compromising various legal actions, then I will consider it. Once these legal actions have finished, presumably this year, it will be easy to arrange if someone else wants to do it.""BBC parliamentary correspondent Mark D'Arcy says it could become an interesting test case for the Commons - about Parliament's ability to summon witnesses.The MPs are looking at how consulting company Cambridge Analytica harvested the data of millions of Facebook users worldwide. The London-based company - which announced it was closing in May - is accused of acquiring data from up to 87 million Facebook profiles for use in political campaigns. Cambridge Analytica has denied any wrongdoing.There have also been questions about links between Cambridge Analytica and the Vote Leave campaign. Vote Leave spent £2.7m on the services of Canadian digital agency AIQ in the run-up to the June 2016 EU referendum and AIQ has admitted it also conducted work for Cambridge Analytica's parent company, SCL.The leaders of the other main Leave campaign, Leave.EU, are due to give evidence to the committee on 12 June. Former Cambridge Analytica chief Alexander Nix appeared before it on Wednesday."

She was a very strong person,"" Dame Margaret Beckett told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.The former foreign secretary described how Lady Wilson had cared for Harold and helped to ""maintain his dignity"" during his long battle with Alzheimer's disease, which ended in his death in 1995.""She was a really, really lovely person and I am very sorry she is gone,"" added Dame Margaret.My love you have stumbled slowlyOn the quiet way to deathAnd you lie where the wind blows stronglyWith a salty spray on its breath.For this men of the island bore you Down paths where the branches meetAnd the only sounds were the crunching grindOf the gravel beneath their feet And the sighing slide of the ebbing tideOn the beach where the breakers meetThe daughter of a reverend, she was born Gladys Mary Baldwin in the Norfolk town of Diss in January 1916.She wrote poetry from the age of six and became a shorthand typist in Cheshire after leaving school, meeting her future husband at a tennis club in the area in 1934.The pair married on New Year's Day in 1940, when Harold was working as a senior civil servant at the Ministry of Fuel and Power.She was at his side during his rise to prominence in the Labour Party but tended to shun the limelight during their years in Downing Street.At her husband's farewell party in March 1976, cabinet minister Tony Benn told her she would now be able to have a quiet life. ""I have done my best,"" she replied, ""but I now just want to slip back into obscurity again.""The Wilsons had homes in London and the Isles of Scilly, where Mary continued to holiday into her late 90s.They had two sons, Robin and Giles, the former now an emeritus professor in mathematics at the Open University, which was founded under his father's government in the 1960s.Leading tributes to Lady Wilson, Jeremy Corbyn wrote on Twitter: ""Sad to hear of the death of Mary Wilson. A wonderful poet and a huge support in Harold's General Election victories. I send my condolences to her family and friends."""

The Virgin founder funds a team in Formula E, the motorsport which is pioneering new technologies for electric cars. He says the deadline should be brought forward to 2025, in line with some other European countries. Roads minister Jesse Norman says 2040 is a ""sensible compromise"".Newsbeat has spent the last seven months following Formula E, the competition where electric cars reach 140mph racing on streets around the world. We've followed DS Virgin Racing, the team owned by Sir Richard, who says that ""every month the technology is getting better and better"".""The teams want to be the best out there, so they're pushing for improvements in battery technology. ""That will mean that when more cars are driving on batteries, they'll be able to go hopefully a few hundred miles rather than maybe 150 or 200.""New petrol and diesel vehicles are due to be banned in the UK from 2040, the government announced in July 2017.It's hoped the move will reduce air pollution.Sir Richard believes 2025 should be the deadline, in line with countries including Norway and the Netherlands. ""I honestly think that we've got to bring everything forward because there are concerns that we could actually have sea levels rising by over 100ft if we lose a big chunk of the Antarctic.""Therefore we've got to move the process of moving to clean energy quicker than most governments around the world are doing.""Manufacturers are also under pressure, which is one of the reasons why the likes of Audi, Jaguar and Renault have signed up to Formula E. Mercedes-Benz and Porsche are set to join the Championship, which is one of a couple of big changes happening in the future. ""Next year we're going to double the amount of energy in our batteries - you're going to have twice the energy in the same box. That's a huge development,"" says Alejandro Agag, the Formula E CEO. Drivers currently use two cars for Formula E races because of battery limitations - but as of next season they're down to one. ""That's going to be a very visible demonstration of how fast this technology is moving forward,"" Alejandro says. But even though battery technology for electric cars is developing quickly, greater infrastructure is required if all new cars are to be electric in 22 years' time. There are 32 million cars on Britain's roads and huge investment will be needed for them all to be charged. AA president Edmund King says the length of time it takes to charge an electric car, compared to filling one up with petrol, is a real challenge.""There is absolutely no way that we could have the infrastructure for 32 million cars being charged at the same time - so we'll have to change the way we think about fuelling our cars.""He says the majority of people will have to charge at home or at work. ""There are grants available to get home charging points installed, but it will still be a challenge in city and town centres and I think there we have to think of things like supermarket car parks or office car parks that could be used for charging infrastructure, particularly at night.""Roads minister Jesse Norman says that there won't immediately be 32 million electric cars on the streets, with only new cars required to be made electric.But he says the government will be ""encouraging people to phase older vehicles out as quickly as possible"".""If you look at it overall we're about as far advanced as almost any government in the world, so I don't think there's anything problematic about where we are and I look forward to seeing more progress in the years to come,"" he said.There has so far been little detail about what the 2040 deadline means for drivers.

2018-06-07,Students want more hours for tuition fees,https://web.archive.org//web/20180608010853/https://www.bbc.com/news/education-44373231,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowStudents want more teaching hours at university - as an annual survey shows that fewer than two in five think they are getting value for money.The survey of 14,000 UK students found tuition fees, teaching quality and lack of contact hours were the biggest causes of dissatisfaction.Measures of well-being, such as anxiety among students, have also worsened.Yvonne Hawkins, of the Office for Students, said the survey was a ""clear signal there is more work to be done"".But Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute (Hepi) which produced the report, said the findings on value for money showed more positive views were emerging.There were 38% of students saying they had good or very good value for money from their course, up from 35% last year.When this was broken down into the devolved parts of the UK, it showed that 35% of students in England thought they were getting good value, compared with 60% in Scotland, where Scottish students do not pay fees.In Wales, 48% of students thought they were getting good value and 36% in Northern Ireland.The survey comes ahead of data being published by the Institute for Fiscal Studies which is expected to show which courses deliver the best financial returns.This is expected to show that courses such as medicine and economics are likely to have future earnings that are 20% above the graduate average, once other factors such as students' backgrounds are taken into account.But studying subjects like creative arts are more likely to deliver a 15% below-average financial return in future earnings.Going to a more selective Russell Group university also is likely to increase the financial return.The government has commissioned a review of post-18 education in England, which will examine whether tuition fees and university represent good value for students and the taxpayer.This annual Hepi report shows the factors that influence whether full-time undergraduate students feel they are getting a good return on their investment.The survey shows a strong link with the perceived quality of teaching and whether students felt they were getting enough hours with academic staff.Students with longer hours were much more likely to be satisfied - with those with fewer than nine hours a week of contact time likely to be the most unconvinced about getting value for money.The annual report showed that despite fees in England having increased sharply from £1,000 to £3,000 and then £9,000, university courses barely changed in terms of average contact time.Although many students thought fees were too high, there was also support for the principle of students making a financial contribution for their degree.The study also showed that almost two-thirds of students, if they had to make the choice again, would still continue with the same course and at the same institution.But Asian students were less likely to feel satisfied with their time at university, compared with white students.Alison Johns, chief executive of the higher education equality agency, Advance HE, which co-produced the report, said: ""It is worrying to see the disparity in the experience of different ethnic groups and I would support more work to get to the root causes of this.""How students reported their own sense of well-being continued to decline. Only 17% of students described themselves as being happy and 14% reported a positive sense of ""life satisfaction"".""Our survey exposes the areas where improvements are needed. But some of them, like improving students' mental well-being - can only be fixed through the concerted and collective effort that involves universities, government and others,"" said Mr Hillman.Ms Hawkins, director of teaching excellence and student experience for the higher education regulator, the Office for Students, said she noted that ""a slightly higher proportion of students feel they have received good value for money this year"".But she said ""significant numbers of students report not being satisfied with their higher education experience. Overall the results send a clear signal that there is more work to be done"".Emmanuelle Algret, 20, from Shropshire is currently completing a science foundation year at the University of Nottingham with a view to moving on to a pharmacy course. On value for money she says: ""There are a lot of courses that are value for money and have a lot of contact time such as medicine and pharmacy.""I have a friend who is doing a history degree and they only get 10 hours of contact time, which isn't great because we all pay the same money.""It's too easy to blame the universities though because the course we take is our choice.""The debates over the cost of university come as UK universities take four of the top 10 places in international rankings.This year's QS World University Rankings puts Oxford in fifth place, Cambridge in sixth, Imperial College London in eighth and University College London in 10th.Massachusetts Institute of Technology from the US is once again ranked in top place."

""Theresa May has so many nooses dangling around her neck that one of those nooses is sure to hang her."" He was talking about splits in the prime minister's cabinet, the need to keep Northern Ireland's unionist DUP on board, UK business demands, EU red lines and Brexit negotiating time running out.""It could be the UK unintentionally crashing out of the EU with no deal simply because time runs out."" Eurocrats also bemoan the fact that the UK government hasn't - in their opinion - been straight with voters, many of whom now have unrealistic expectations about the outcome of Brexit negotiations. Why isn't that true?Well, says the EU, the European Single Market was designed to create frictionless trade between its members and close associates, like Norway. To benefit, you have to be one of the gang and respect club rules and restrictions. Note: Once you are out of the club, a free trade agreement is far from frictionless and the EU is an unapologetically hard-nosed trade negotiator. Fondly referred to here as Brexit's square-peg, round-hole issueThe government has refused to accept a Northern Ireland-specific arrangement. Brussels says a UK-wide customs deal alone won't do it.   Read more here:In an effort to bring some clarity to the debate - and to dispel allegations made by some in the UK, including the government's own chief Brexit negotiator, that Brussels is being difficult in negotiations to punish Britain for leaving - EU figures have become very fond of going back to Brexit basics. The UK, they say, is free to choose the type of relationship it wants with the EU: staying in or leaving; remaining closely aligned or more at arm's length with the bloc after Brexit. As long, says Brussels, as the shape of that relationship complies with EU rules as well as UK wishes since it will be an agreement between the two parties. But, insists Brussels, where the UK has no choice if it wants an agreement with the EU, is when it comes to the Irish border. I welcome publication of #UK proposal on customs aspects of IE/NI backstop. We will examine it with 3 questions: is it a workable solution to avoid a hard border? Does it respect the integrity of the SM/CU? Is it an all-weather backstop?End of Twitter post  by @MichelBarnierBack in December, the UK and EU signed up to ensuring there would be no re-introduction of a hard border on the island of Ireland in order to safeguard the Good Friday accord. This is the reddest of red lines for the EU. All its normally fractious members are in agreement. And while the future relationship between the EU and UK remains foggy and undecided, Brussels is insisting on a time-unlimited, rock-solid backstop agreement to ensure that, as a last resort, and whatever else happens in Brexit talks, there will be no new hard border. And this is where there is further confusion at the moment - so hold on to your seat. The UK government is talking about a backstop agreement too, but it is referring to what customs arrangement could be put in place for the whole of the UK until a new post-Brexit customs deal is up and operational. This alone will not cut the mustard with the EU over Ireland. So - if and when the UK government finally reaches agreement on what it desires as the future EU-UK relationship - the warning from Brussels is this: pay attention to the Irish border; whatever else is agreed it could still bring the whole Brexit deal crashing down.

2018-06-07,Brexit: Key dates,https://web.archive.org//web/20180608010853/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44374613,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe countdown to Britain's planned departure from the EU is under way - here are the key dates and parliamentary battles on the road to Brexit.Ratification of the withdrawal agreement by the UK Parliament and the European Parliament. One of the key Brexit laws will return to the House of Commons this week. MPs will have to decide whether to accept or reject changes made to the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill by the House of Lords. Peers inflicted an unprecedented 15 defeats on the government in April and May on issues ranging from a customs union to environmental protection.There has been a lot of debate over whether Theresa May has enough Conservative colleagues onside to avoid damaging defeats on the Withdrawal Bill. But this is just one of the parliamentary hoops the government has to jump through before Brexit day. What is it?A law that will repeal the European Communities Act which brought the UK into the EU in 1972, and copy EU laws and regulations that are currently in force into UK law.It will also give ministers powers to make small changes to laws and regulations without having to bring a whole new bill to Parliament. This is one of the powers that opponents have feared could be open to abuse. When?The bill entered Parliament in July 2017 and has slowly made its way through both the House of Commons and Lords. After the government lost 15 votes on changes to the proposed bill in the Lords, MPs will now debate and vote on the changes. The bill will go back and forth between the two houses until there are no more changes being made, in a process known as ""ping-pong"".Potential flashpointsIf Mrs May's government fails to win enough votes in the Commons, the bill could be passed with some significant conditions attached. One of the most high-profile changes would require the government to report to Parliament on its effort to negotiate a customs union - something that has been ruled out by the PM.Please upgrade your browserWhat are they?In last year's Queen's Speech, the government announced eight Brexit laws that will be needed to prepare the country before it leaves the EU. Some of these have begun their journey through Parliament, but many of them are not even published yet, including a Fisheries Bill, Migration Bill and Agriculture Bill - all areas that will need significant new legislation once we are no longer under European jurisdiction. The two most high-profile are the Trade Bill and the Taxation (Cross-Border Trade) Bill, also known as the Customs Bill. When? Good question. The government has been criticised for its slow progress on key legislation. The Customs and Trade Bills have both passed the first stages in the House of Commons but no date is set for their return, perhaps because the next stage will involve crunch votes on the customs union that Mrs May could lose.Potential flashpointsWhen the Trade Bill returns to the Commons, MPs will vote on an amendment tabled by Conservative MP Anna Soubry. If passed, the amendment would force the government to make it an ""objective"" to take ""all necessary steps"" to set up a customs union between the UK and EU. This is much stronger wording than the amendment to the Withdrawal Bill and defeat would be a significant blow to Mrs May's plans.What is it?MPs will have a vote on the final withdrawal agreement and the framework for the future partnership once they've been negotiated with the EU. This is the ""meaningful vote"" promised to MPs by the prime minister. Brexit Secretary David Davis has said the vote will be on a motion that can be amended and that the government will treat the result as binding.When?Soon after the withdrawal agreement has been finalised (expected by the end of October 2018). Mr Davis has said the vote will take place before the European Parliament votes on the agreement. Potential flashpointsThis is potentially the biggest threat to the government's plans. Ministers have presented the vote as a decision between approving their withdrawal agreement and ""no deal"". If MPs can amend the motion, they could put conditions on the withdrawal agreement. The Lords added an amendment which would potentially give MPs even more power. Under that proposal they could direct the government on how it should act if the withdrawal agreement is rejected.What is it?Another bill that needs to be passed before the UK leaves the EU. It will enshrine the withdrawal agreement in law and give legal effect to whatever transition period is agreed. The difference between this and the motion in Parliament is that the motion is there to approve the withdrawal agreement while the bill is there to implement it. When?The bill cannot be written until there is a withdrawal agreement and it must be passed before Brexit day (29 March 2019). MPs complicated the process in December when they passed an amendment to the Withdrawal Bill - proposed by Conservative MP Dominic Grieve - that would require this bill to be passed before the government can use secondary legislation to implement Brexit. This means the vote on this bill will act as another ""meaningful vote"".Potential flashpointsIt is unclear what would happen if Parliament rejects the Withdrawal and Implementation Bill.What is it?Under the Withdrawal Bill, the government has the power to make changes to laws that need to happen before Brexit day. This is called secondary legislation and is often used to make small technical changes to laws. But opposition politicians have warned that excessive use of these powers could be undemocratic. When?The powers are contained in the Withdrawal Bill. But after MPs voted for Mr Grieve's amendment, ministers will not be allowed to use the powers until the Withdrawal and Implementation Bill has been passed.What is it?The final withdrawal agreement will have to be ratified as an international treaty. The government has to present international treaties to both houses of Parliament. If neither house raises objections, the treaty is passed and does not necessarily have to be debated or voted on. If there is an objection, ministers have 21 days to explain the merits of the treaty, before presenting it to Parliament again. This could technically be repeated multiple times.When?Mr Davis has said the treaty will have to be ratified before the withdrawal agreement can ""enter into force"".Potential flashpointsIt is unlikely that there would be a vote - or even a debate - on the treaty, seeing as the issues will have already been debated and voted on in the meaningful vote. Theoretically, Parliament could vote against the treaty, but it will not be able to amend it.The UK and EU have to agree on the terms of the UK's departure - as well as what sort of trading relationship they will have after Brexit. The UK is hoping an agreement can be reached on both of these elements at the EU summit in October.The government has promised a white paper setting out in detail what it wants from Brexit - but its publication has been delayed while wrangling goes on behind the scenes about what to put in it.There is expected to be a ""political declaration"" on the framework for future UK-EU relations after the October summit. MPs will then be given a vote on the withdrawal agreement before it goes to the European Parliament for ratification.But a number of sticking points remain - and all have to be resolved before the withdrawal agreement can be signed off and put to a vote. Here are the main issues that need to be sorted out (there are a lot of smaller ones too - you can read more about those here).This is the biggest sticking point.Both sides have committed to avoiding the return of a hard border, including physical infrastructure or related checks and controls, between Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.They want to achieve this by agreeing a comprehensive free trade deal with the continuation of open borders.But that could be difficult if the UK government sticks to its policy of leaving the EU single market and customs union.The UK government is working on two possible solutions - a ""customs partnership"", which would see the UK collecting tariffs on behalf of the EU, and ""maximum facilitation"", which would use new technology to track goods passing across the border.The EU has previously rejected both ideas.If all else fails, Brussels has proposed a ""backstop"" solution - which would see Northern Ireland stick to those rules of the customs union and single market that are required for cross-border co-operation to continue.But the UK government is against this idea, saying it would effectively separate Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK and create a border in the Irish Sea.Mrs May also wants an insurance policy to maintain an invisible border if trade talks break down. She is expected to set out details of her ""backstop"" proposal in due course, having seen her previous suggestion rejected by Brussels.The UK has set a lot of store by establishing a high level of co-operation on security issues, like counter-terrorism and the fight against organised crime, with the EU after Brexit. But there are significant disagreements about how this will work - and the EU's decision to exclude the UK from the Galileo satellite system on security grounds has poisoned the atmosphere, with the UK claiming it shows a lack of trust.The UK thinks that co-operation on extradition, the British relationship with the EU crime-fighting agency Europol and the sharing of criminal records should be the subject of a separate security treaty which the two sides should begin negotiating straight away.This is another issue that could bring the whole deal down, according to Michel Barnier.The UK is committed to pulling out of the European Court of Justice, the mechanism used to settle disputes between member states by interpreting and enforcing single market rules.The EU has proposed a joint committee made up of representatives appointed by London and Brussels. If they can't solve a problem, it would be referred to the European Court of Justice.The UK government likes the idea of a joint committee but not of the European Court of Justice having the final say.British companies hold all sorts of personal data belonging to EU citizens, and the European Commission thinks that European data protection laws should continue to apply to it after Brexit.The UK would like a comprehensive deal on data-sharing with the EU as part of the discussions about the future relationship, and is wary of agreeing divorce-related measures that could tie its hands.The EU wants the UK to share customs data for three years and information about certain taxes for five years after the end of the transition period.This is how the Brexit process is meant to go - but the UK or the EU could pull the plug on talks at any time. And, in theory, the UK and the other 27 EU members could agree to change the timetable or even halt the process Brexit altogether.As the European Commission likes to say, ""nothing is agreed until everything is agreed""."
2018-06-07,Paul Dacre steps down,https://web.archive.org//web/20180608010853/https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-44392661,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowSub-editors at the Mail might take against the cliché, but Paul Dacre was the last of his kind.When he entered the profession in the early 1970s, British newspapers had a degree of influence that they do not have now.To a greater extent than has generally been recognised, his experience of Washington and America in the 1970s was formative.David English decided early on that Dacre would be his successor at the Mail, and had the charm to tempt him. Rupert Murdoch wanted him to be editor of The Times, but Dacre declined.At the Mail, he both channelled and shaped the conservatism of middle class Britain beyond London.He felt that these people, whose quiet patriotism and suburban affections he shared, were neglected by the ""liberal metropolitan elite"" - a phrase he did much to popularise, along with ""cultural Marxism"".There remain big questions about his departure: from why now, to what his new role will actually be, and who his successor is. Answers to these may not become clear for some days. At 70, and having been an editor for 26 years, sheer longevity must account for something, and the logic of what probably ought to happen at the Mail - editorial savings, synergies with Mail Online, and so on - have caused stress for all newspaper chiefs.Dacre is hated by many of his fellow countrymen, though social media may amplify negative feelings, and the verdict of millions of readers who considered his paper value for money for decades should not be forgotten.Print journalism is a trade rather than a profession - and within it, Dacre was the master craftsman. He had an obsessive eye for detail, and often said he thought he was a better re-write man than reporter. Colleagues, including those with very different politics, respected his intuitive understanding of his audience. It is reasonable to claim that Brexit was in part his doing, because it followed years of campaigning against the EU, and warnings - sometimes lurid - about immigration.Few people now remember that both the Standard and the Mail were pro-EU before he took their helms.Other Dacre-led campaigns garnered support from across the political spectrum.The pursuit of justice for Stephen Lawrence was the best-known; but the campaigns for relatives of victims of the Omagh bombing, for Gary McKinnon, and more recently against plastic bags have had a huge impact.Dacre also led objections to the system of regulation of the press recommended by Lord Leveson, and desired by many victims of press abuse.Though he oversaw the launch of both Metro and Mail Online, his involvement in both is complex.On Metro, he ensured that it didn't have the editorial power to compromise the Mail's circulation.On Mail Online, he cannot have helped but notice that many of the editorial values of the Mail were absent. Prime ministers and politicians fawned before him, but he often regarded them as irritants.David Cameron never impressed him. Ken Clarke, who the Mail backed to be Tory leader, came to embody a Europhilia Dacre disdained.And while he loathed much of Blairism, including its figurehead, he found in Gordon Brown - who he once described as ""touched by the mantle of greatness"" - a genuine friend. Dacre's editorship of the Mail was testimony to the power of newspapers within a culture. As they - and he - retreat from centre stage, it's not yet clear what will replace them.If you're interested in issues such as these, please follow me on Twitter or Facebook; and also please subscribe to The Media Show podcast from Radio 4.

Has the moment for it passed?It's an idea that has been around for at least 100 years, although calls for the creation an English Parliament reached a crescendo in the immediate aftermath of the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, when more powers were promised for the Scottish Parliament.The clamour has died down for now, as the Westminster political class is consumed by Brexit - but the BBC's survey suggests the forces behind it have not.Mike Kenny, professor of public policy at Cambridge University, has argued that the Brexit vote was driven, in part, by a form of English nationalism among voters who felt marginalised and ignored by the political establishment - and yearned for something to identify with.The BBC survey suggests pride in being English is strongest in areas that voted strongly for Brexit, such as the East and North of England. These are also the areas that feel most disconnected from Westminster and where the support for an English Parliament is it its highest.Just over half of Leave voters - 52% - back an English Parliament compared with 34% of Remainers.Prof Kenny sees in the new BBC survey the emergence of two polarised ""forms of patriotism"" - a pride in being English, which is strongest among older voters in non-Metropolitan areas, and a pride in being British, which is strongest in London among younger people.The BBC survey puts overall support for an English Parliament at 41%. This is certainly a higher than in some previous surveys but as a March University College London report on options for an English Parliament pointed out, it has never been a particularly high priority for voters.Polls suggest voters have been more keen on ""barring non-English MPs from voting on English-only matters at Westminster - a change which was not delivered by the 2015 'English votes for English laws' (EVEL) procedures"", adds the UCL Constitution Unit's report.We will come to English Votes for English Laws later. But why was an English Parliament not set up when new Parliaments for Scotland and Wales were established by Tony Blair's Labour government in the late 1990s?Mr Blair's government thought the Scottish Parliament would kill Scottish nationalism stone dead, says Jack Sheldon, co-author of the Constitution Unit report.In fact, the opposite happened.At the same time, the idea of home rule for England, previously seen as an obsession of the far right and and obscure corners of academia, began to gain more widespread support - another development Labour failed to anticipate or, say critics, preferred not to think about.""I don't think Labour were particularly interested in the English question,"" says Jack Sheldon, who now works with Prof Kenny at Cambridge.Many in England look enviously at the authority devolved to the other UK nations, complaining that English local government has been emasculated, as central government has become more distant.  Only 13% of people think politicians in Westminster reflect their real concerns.   Prioritising England's affairs, even if that threatens the United Kingdom, is a policy supported by a quarter of English residents, according to our survey, a figure that appears to rise to a third in counties like Lincolnshire and towns like Rotherham and Wakefield.One proposal is that England should have its own Parliament, an idea included in the UKIP manifesto at the last election.  Roughly four people in 10 support the creation of such a body, rising to half the population in parts of Essex, for example.  But the survey suggests greater enthusiasm for a form of devolution that also enjoys broader political support (even if it draws blank looks from many), introducing combined authorities.Few dinner tables echo joyously to fevered debate about a new tier of public administration for England, so it is remarkable that, after a brief explanation of their function, our poll finds almost half the population (48%) support having a combined authority in their area.Read the rest of the blogTony Blair's first Lord Chancellor, Lord Irvine, was once quoted as saying the best thing to do about the West Lothian question was to ""stop asking it"".""National identities usually strengthen when people feel hard done by. Today's English identity reflects a growing sense that English people lack a real voice on the things that matter to them,"" wrote former Labour MP John Denham in a 2012 article for the IPPR think tank.Worse, he added, ""they feel they are losing out and being treated less fairly than others"". Tony Blair wanted to hand more power to Scotland and Wales but was firmly against the idea of a federal United Kingdom, along German lines, where central government passes broad ""framework"" legislation and regional government fills in the detail.So powers were handed wholesale to the Scottish and Welsh governments.Instead of an English Parliament, Mr Blair preferred to give the English regions a boost - and their own voice - through devolved assemblies.But despite an energetic campaign by his deputy, John Prescott, the idea was killed off in 2004 when the North-East of England - the area chosen as a test bed for the plan - overwhelmingly rejected it in a referendum.Looking back, says Prof Kenny, Labour's decision to base their proposed administrative units on EU regions - lashing together parts of the country like Tyneside and Teesside that had little in common culturally or, as the BBC survey suggests, were active rivals, - was probably a mistake.He is ""slightly surprised"" by the apparent popularity of the Conservative government's combined authorities, new bodies made up council leaders in nine regions in England, such as Greater Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield City region.These were were backed by 48% of respondents to the BBC poll (although 34% were ""don't knows"" and the survey suggests the newly elected metro mayors have some work to do make voters aware of their existence).The combined authorities at least have the virtue of not creating a new class of politician, argues Prof Kenny, just a single elected ""metro Mayor,"" such as Andy Burnham in Greater Manchester.(One cast iron rule of devolution appears to be that voters want more local control but not more politicians).Which brings us back to the English Parliament, which after a long and lonely campaign by the English Democrats party and latterly UKIP, briefly burst on to the Westminster scene after the Scottish referendum.Then Prime Minister David Cameron's solution to growing calls for an English Parliament - to balance the promise of more powers for the Scottish Parliament - was ""English Votes for English Laws"".Put as simply as possible, English Votes for English Laws allows MPs representing constituencies in England (and England and Wales) the opportunity to veto certain legislation that applies only in England (or England and Wales).Labour was firmly opposed to the idea, arguing it would create two classes of MPs and threaten the stability of the Union.Mr Cameron claimed it would address the feeling of ""resentment"" felt in some parts of the UK that ""undermines the bonds and the fellow-feeling that are the basis of the United Kingdom"".In fact, critics say, neither of these things has so far happened.""English Votes for English Laws is a much more modest set of changes than you might have been let to believe from the controversy that surrounded it."" says Daniel Gover, of Project EVEL, which monitors the new law. ""And I think that has been borne out by the way it has operated so far."" There have been 33 Commons votes under the EVEL procedures since they became law in October 2015, and ""not one of them has had the outcome changed as a result of EVEL"", he adds.""English Votes for English Laws is definitely not the equivalent of an English Parliament.""This was partly by design, says Mr Gover, but is also a reflection of the current make-up of the Commons, with one party, the Conservatives, having a comfortable majority in England.It might become a live issue if a future Labour government had rely on SNP votes to keep it in power, he suggests.And, as all the experts are keen to point out, there are other ways of giving England a voice that don't involve expensive new glass and steel parliament buildings - such as a ""grand committee"" at Westminster to decide on English-only laws.Perhaps, suggests Jack Sheldon, if Brexit fails to deliver on its promise of a better life and more control for the ""left behind"" they will start to look around for another issue to get behind.And an English Parliament might be it. But instead of rushing head long into it, with only a ""vague"" idea of what the finished product might look like - as he suggests happened with Brexit - he and and co-author Meg Russell have called for the establishment of a ""citizen's convention"" to take a serious look at the different options."
2018-06-07,Stop Brexit campaign,https://web.archive.org//web/20180608010853/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44331013,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowBest for Britain is this week launching a national campaign to stop Brexit. Who is behind it?Best for Britain aims to persuade MPs to back a referendum on the final Brexit deal secured by Theresa May when they vote on it in the autumn, with staying in the EU an option on the ballot paper.It would aim to persuade enough Leave voters to change their mind to vote to keep Britain in the EU - but the first stage of its campaign aims to generate pressure for another referendum.Its campaign slogan - already displayed on billboards in London, Birmingham, Manchester and Liverpool and in newspaper ads - is ""We all deserve a final say on the Brexit deal.""According to the Observer, Best for Britain will send a ""roadmap"" to MPs and peers, setting out how they could stop Brexit, when it launches its campaign on Friday. The group believes a referendum could be held in December, or possibly as late as February or March - when the UK is set to officially quit the EU - if Brussels agrees to it.It is targeting much of its campaigning muscle at the Labour Party's front bench, which is against another referendum - but it also needs at least 10 Conservative ""rebels"" on board in order to win a vote in Parliament on an amendment calling for a referendum.The campaign is also attempting to shore up support among Labour backbenchers sceptical about Brexit and is reportedly targeting 50 Leave-supporting Labour constituencies with billboard ads close to MPs' offices. The campaign will also lobby the big trade unions in an effort to exert pressure on the Labour leadership and is running a social-media campaign and a ""Labour Against Brexit"" speaking tour by leading Labour Remainers. It is also funding a grassroots campaign and has handed cash to local volunteers to ""help stop Brexit in your area"". Best for Britain was set up in April 2017, just before June's snap general election. Its initial aim was to encourage tactical voting to try to get more pro-Remain MPs into the House of Commons. The group said more than a million people had consulted its tactical voting website ahead of 8 June to find pro-Remain candidates.It reported spending £353,118 between June 2016 and June 2017, and made donations to pro-European candidates in marginal seats, including the Lib Dems' Tom Brake, Labour's Peter Kyle and Green MP Caroline Lucas. One of the group's founding members, Gina Miller, defeated the government over its power to trigger Article 50 without parliamentary consent, in the Supreme Court in January 2017. However, she stood down the day after the 2017 general election, saying the group had become too party political.Officially registered as UK-EU Open Policy Limited, Best for Britain is led by business and charity sector figures. This is in contrast to the MP-led People's Vote campaign - which is also pushing for a referendum on the final Brexit deal, although the two campaigns will join forces on 23 June to stage a march on Parliament.Best for Britain has £2.4m in its coffers and is asking donors for another £3.2m to realise its campaigning ambitions, according to its director of communications, Paul Butters, a former spokesman for Tim Farron, the ex-Liberal Democrat leader.The biggest individual donor is international financier George Soros, a Hungarian-born US citizen, who has given Best for Britain £800,000 in total so far, with £400,000 of that coming since the start of the year through his pro-European Open Society Foundation.Having made his billions in finance, including betting against sterling on Black Wednesday in 1992 - which gained him a reputation as the ""man who broke the Bank of England"" - Mr Soros, 87, donated more than £8bn to philanthropic causes between 1979 and 2011.UK electoral law bans foreign donations but only in the run-up to elections or referendums. Best for Britain says it has not taken money from overseas because the Soros donations came via his Open Society Foundations UK branch. The campaign is also keen to stress that it has also raised significant sums from more than 8,000 small donors.But the involvement of Mr Soros has generated a backlash in the Brexit-backing media, with the Daily Mail telling him on its front page: ""Butt out Mr Soros. You can keep your tainted money.""Mr Soros hit back at the Daily Mail's headline in an article for the Mail on Sunday, explaining why his love for Britain had led him to campaign against the ""tragic mistake"" of Brexit - and the campaign launched a Gofundme crowdfunding page entitled Help Best for Britain fight the Daily Mail, which has raised more than £64,000 in the past 12 days.Pro-Brexit campaign Leave Means Leave is, meanwhile, raising funds to combat Best for Britain, with its co-chairman John Longworth telling supporters in an email: ""We are determined to secure the swift, clean Brexit you all voted for.""Best for Britain is currently under investigation by the Electoral Commission, which oversees campaign spending, for submitting a return with invoices missing and for failing to return a donation of £25,000 from an impermissible donor within 30 days. It says it has complied with all relevant regulations.Lord Malloch-Brown, appointed 2 November 2017. A former foreign office minister, under Gordon Brown, who became a life peer in July 2007. Before that, he served as UN deputy secretary general, and from 1977 to 1979 he was a political correspondent at the pro-EU Economist, returning in 1983 for three years as founding editor of the Economist Development Report.The 64-year-old peer sparked controversy when he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme last month that Britain might as well stay in the EU, given the impossibility of divorcing itself from the Continent's problems. He said: ""Britain's history as an island nation adjacent to mainland Europe is when we try to, sort of, pull away from Europe's problems and close ourselves off to them, they have a horrible habit of infecting us anyway - appeasement in the 1930s, you name it. For centuries, Britain has ignored events on continental Europe at its peril.""Chief executive officer: Eloise Todd, 41. Until December 2016, Ms Todd worked in Brussels as global director of U2 singer Bono's anti-poverty charity, One. She had worked in the European Parliament for seven years after graduating from the College of Europe in Bruges.The Guardian has suggested that it was her personal connection to Best for Britain's biggest donor, George Soros, through the international development sector, that attracted him to the group, instead of better-known campaigns such as Open Britain, which is now part of the People's Vote group.Director: Sir Clive Cowdery, appointed 16 December 2016. The insurance businessman founded the Resolution Foundation think tank in 2005. He was chairman and chief executive of General Electric Insurance Holdings from 1998 to 2003. Knighted in the 2016 New Year Honours for services to children and social mobility, Sir Clive, 55, is worth an estimated £147m, according to the Sunday Times Rich List 2018, in which he ranked 804th in Britain. Director: Shakuntala Ghosh, appointed 3 March 2017. Chief executive of the charity Clore Social Leadership, which runs management training courses for charity workers, since April 2015, ""Shaks"" Ghosh, 61, led homelessness charity Crisis from 1997 to 2007. She has also held posts at the National Housing Federation and Centrepoint.Chief economist: Anatole Kaletsky, appointed 16 December 2016. Another former Economist journalist, Mr Kaletsky was appointed chairman of the Institute for New Economic Thinking in 2012, a foundation established after the 2008 financial crisis with $200m (£150m) of grants from, among others, George Soros. In 2010, he wrote Capitalism 4.0: The Birth of a New Economy in the Aftermath of Crisis.Director: Peter Norris, appointed 16 December 2016. Known as Sir Richard Branson's right-hand man, Mr Norris, 63, has been chairman of the Virgin Group since 2001. Sir Richard donated £25,000 and office space to the campaign in 2017 to help launch it. Before Virgin, Mr Norris was chief executive of Barings Bank when it collapsed in the Nick Leeson ""rogue trader"" scandal in 1995. He was temporarily banned from being a director by the Department of Trade and Industry in 1998.Director: Stephen Peel, appointed 19 October 2016. A former Goldman Sachs executive who represented Great Britain in rowing at the 1988 Seoul Olympics, Mr Peel, 52, has donated more than £75,000 to Best for Britain.Gina Miller: The businesswoman and philanthropist initially spearheaded Best for Britain, saying in her launch speech: ""Throughout the course of this general election campaign, we will be focusing on educating and empowering people to make a tactical vote and choosing MPs who will do the best for Britain. ""   But she stood down the day after the 2017 general election and has distanced herself from the group, saying it had become more focused on ""bringing down the Tories"" than Brexit.Alan Milburn: Chairman of the Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission from 2012 to 2017, the 60-year-old served in Tony Blair's government, as chief secretary to the Treasury from 1998 to 1999, then as secretary of state for health until 2003. He has been chancellor of Lancaster University since 2015. He resigned from Best of Britain on 3 March 2017.Sally Tallant: The director of the Liverpool Biennial festival of contemporary art, Sally Tallant, 50, resigned from the group in April 2017."
2018-06-07,Voting marathon,https://web.archive.org//web/20180608010853/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44357101,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowEven at lunchtime today, a former minister stalking the green and gold corridors of this place, made a familiar moan, ""there's nothing happening in this place"".MPs complain often ""we have hardly anything to do"", so few new draft laws are actually being put forward, so little do they have to scrutinise and then vote on. Suggest that to the government and it would push back pretty strongly, even if some ministers might raise an eyebrow while doing so. But next Tuesday isn't going to be like that at all with a marathon session of Brexit business back in the Commons. The Lords beat the government fifteen times on its EU Withdrawal Bill, forcing changes to ministers' plans. The government will try to unpick those alterations. So while it's hard to know precisely how many votes there will be, there will be a lot, and it is certainly unusual to have them all in one day. The bill passed its first hurdle in the Commons a few months ago, but the House of Lords then made plenty of nips and tucks, or amendments, on how customs should work after Brexit, on the Irish border, on whether we should stay in a different free trade area, the EEA, and plenty of other issues besides.What the government wants is to undo the changes the Lords made to the bill.But it is far from clear that they can rely on the votes in the Commons to do so. For many weeks potential Tory rebels who want a closer relationship with the EU after Brexit, have been planning how they might vote - this could be the moment then they gang together to beat the government. They are confident that they could do so if they choose to, one of them said to me today, ""some of us just are starting to think we have to fill in the gaps"" trying to force the prime minister's hand to make up for what some see as the absence of leadership, saying No 10 has an ""untenable lack of strategy, and it's running out of road"".Whether in the end they have the guts to do so next Tuesday, there's already a row. After months of a relatively quiet Parliament, trying to ram 15 votes through on the bill in one day is not exactly giving MPs time and space for debate. Some around here are crying foul already. Surely the whips aren't trying to squeeze out dissent in the Remain camp?  Perish the thought. But it's worth noting on the Eurosceptic side there's satisfaction that the bill is at last returning to the Commons, and the votes all take place in one day - ""bish bash bosh"" - as one source described it.There's the possibility that the bill, with losses or victories for the government will speed straight back to the lords within days. Next week there certainly will not be the case that ""there's nothing happening"".PS: While Parliament is going to sound very divided in the next ten days, if you have been following the Customs debate in particular - which I know I have probably written about far too much - there is a sense, not of an answer, but of a developing compromise. Two Cabinet ministers have told me now that they expect the prime minister to end up in a position where she plumps for the revised 'max fac' proposal, but has to admit it won't be ready for years. One of them today suggested the most likely outcome would be to move to a new 'Customs Partnership' at the end of the Brexit Implementation Period, then to 'max fac' once the technology has been developed in years to come. What Brussels will make of it is a different question. And with the Brexit White Paper possibly delayed until after the June summit, it is possible that the government still doesn't come up with its solution on this until July. PPS: If that's one compromise, here's another potential one. Open Europe, the think tank that is officially neutral but that has close links to Eurosceptics has published a paper putting forward a possible compromise for the future economic relationship with the EU. In essence, the UK would stay closely tied to the EU in terms of goods, but go our own way on services. Nothing about this is easy, and again, Brussels has always pushed back at the idea of splitting up any sectors. But it has gathered quite a bit of attention and support around Westminster, and it's worth a read. Click here to read it.  "
2018-06-07,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20180608010853/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks have now moved on to future relations - after agreement was reached on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree within six months on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide, but first let's go back to the basics...It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.1% in the first three months of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.4%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand near a 40-year year low of 4.2%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 4.2% in the year to March 2018, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May is seeking to put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. If passed, it will end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, is supposed to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each playing roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanAn agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement wopuld only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.The full details are not yet known but UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72.We don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pounds buy fewer euros. A slump in the value of the dollar means the exchange rate with the pound is pretty close to where it was before the referendum.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.The UK has proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.A method for calculating the bill has been agreed, but the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more.The question of how and when payments will be made still needs to resolved, but it will be a schedule lasting for many years to come, and it is highly unlikely that anyone will ever be able to give an exact figure for the size of the divorce bill.UK sources say it will be up to £40bn, but some EU sources expect it to be higher than that. No-one can say for sure, and both sides want to keep it that way.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 6.5% in 2016 to 2.7% in 2017, according to the Halifax. It said the slowdown was driven by a squeeze on real wage growth.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-06-07,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180608010853/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to £840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

On the two previous occasions in 1970 and February 1974 the PM and the party lost office. While there is no other conceivable administration in the new parliament other than a Conservative-led one, it remains to be seen whether the PM will retain her position. However, so long as the Conservatives can reach an accommodation with the DUP they will have a working majority in the House of Commons.  BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed:When the general election exit poll was revealed at 10pm, the pound immediately dropped by 2% as investors took a position that a hung parliament was a possible outcome of the general election.Why would that cause the currency to decline? Because a hung parliament means that the government's direction of travel would be less certain.

""After that, I'll be bringing my ministers together for an away day at Chequers to finalise the white paper we're going to be publishing.""And then before Parliament breaks for the summer, we'll be bringing the Trade and Customs Bill back to the House of Commons. ""Throughout all of that time, the negotiations will be continuing.""Please upgrade your browserThis week's events have once again highlighted the gulf of opinion in the cabinet over Brexit.On Thursday, Mrs May was forced to agree to an ""expected end date"" of December 2021 for any interim arrangements after Brexit Secretary David Davis threatened to resign over the wording of the UK's proposed temporary customs agreement - the so-called backstop.The proposal would see the UK match EU trade tariffs temporarily in order to avoid a hard Irish border post-Brexit.That row was followed by comments from the Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - recorded at a private dinner - where he warned of a Brexit meltdown, and said issues around the Irish border were mistakenly being allowed to dominate proceedings.Mr Johnson also branded the Treasury - and, by implication, Chancellor Philip Hammond, ""the heart of remain"".Responding to his comments, Mrs May said: ""The foreign secretary has strong views on Brexit, but so do I. That's why I'm getting on with delivering Brexit.""But on Friday EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier criticised Mrs May's proposals for a customs arrangement. He stressed that he was not rejecting the UK prime minister's ideas - but said any ""backstop"" to prevent a hard Irish border could not be time-limited.Mr Barnier said the UK paper ""raises more questions than it answers"" but would be examined ""objectively"".Mrs May told the BBC: ""This is a negotiation, Michel Barnier has said exactly that point.""We have put a proposal on the table, on this backstop relating to Northern Ireland, we will now sit down and negotiate it with the European Union."""

Mrs May's proposal would involve the whole of the UK, matching EU trade tariffs for a period instead.But Mr Barnier said: ""Let me be clear: our backstop cannot be extended to the whole UK. Why? Because it has been designed for the specific situation of Northern Ireland.""He added: ""Let's go back to pragmatism. Checks carried out on ferries are less disruptive than along a 500km-long land border. In addition, these checks can build on arrangements and facilities which already exist between the rest of the UK and Northern Ireland."""

2018-06-08,Arron Banks refuses to appear before MPs,https://web.archive.org//web/20180608232930/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44413394,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowLeave.EU founder Arron Banks has accused MPs of a ""witch hunt"" against pro-Brexit groups after pulling out of a scheduled Commons hearing next week.Mr Banks had been due to give evidence to the Commons culture committee's inquiry into fake news on Tuesday.But he suggested it was biased as it had no Leave-voting MPs and had not called Remain groups for questioning.It follows a row over Vote Leave director Dominic Cummings' refusal to appear before the same committee.The Commons voted on Thursday to censure Mr Cummings and to require him to appear before 20 June.In a letter to Damian Collins, the Tory MP who chairs the committee, Mr Banks accused the committee of working with the Electoral Commission and Information Commissioner to target Leave-supporting groups.He suggested the committee had ""colluded"" with activist group Fair Vote Project, which has brought a legal action in the US against two firms controlled by Mr Banks, claiming they had improperly transferred personal data as part of a tie-up with the University of Mississippi. The case stems from the furore over the alleged harvesting of personal Facebook data by Cambridge Analytica and whether it was used to influence the outcome of the US presidential election and Brexit referendum.Mr Banks, who denies the allegations, said claims made by former Cambridge Analytica (CA) director Brittany Kaiser to the committee had been cited in the US lawsuit.Ms Kaiser told MPs in April that data misuse was ""rife"" among the Mr Banks-controlled Eldon Insurance and Big Data Dolphins firms, that Mr Banks asked Cambridge Analytica for a joint strategy for Eldon Insurance, Leave.EU and UKIP and that Cambridge Analytica ""took receipt"" of UKIP's membership data as part of this.Leave.EU rejects Ms Kaiser's statements and CA, which is being investigated by the Information Commissioner, said it has never received data from any Banks company.Mr Banks said the cross-party committee had ""actively supported"" the Fair Vote Project through the ""early release"" of written evidence from Ms Kaiser before her appearance.Mr Banks said he would be complaining to the parliamentary authorities and he and fellow Leave.EU director Andy Wigmore would not appear before the committee until the matter had been settled.""It is perfectly clear that the committee, which comprises only of Remain supporting MPs, is conducting a co-ordinated 'witch hunt' of Leave groups, involving the Electoral Commission and the Information Commissioner,"" he said. ""You have called no witnesses from the Remain campaign or associated groups.""In response, Mr Collins said that it was not just the committee that had questions for Mr Banks and that it would continue to ""follow the evidence"".And the Fair Vote Project said its US court action related solely to securing key documents and should not prevent Mr Banks from appearing before MPs. ""The court in Mississippi, the committee, the ICO and the Electoral Commission are all seeking answers to legitimate questions,"" said its director Kyle Taylor. ""We believe Mr Banks and Mr Wigmore can provide them.""Mr Banks has also said Leave.EU would appeal against a £70,000 fine from the Electoral Commission for breaches of election law in the Brexit referendum. The Electoral Commission said the group - which was separate from the official pro-Brexit group Vote Leave - failed to report ""at least"" £77,380 it spent. "

The government has rejected nearly all of the 15 amendments made by the House of Lords.It has accepted one amendment - on allowing EU law to be replicated in the UK - and is looking favourably at another,  by Lord Dubs on lone child refugees, but with changed wording.Speaking on her way to the G7 summit in Canada, Prime Minister Theresa May told reporters: ""I hope what everybody will see when they come to vote next week is the importance of ensuring that we get the EU Withdrawal Bill onto the statute book because it's that EU Withdrawal Bill that ensures that we're able to have that smooth transition when we leave the European Union.""But Labour said it was ""vital"" that Parliament had a meaningful vote on the Brexit deal. Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer said it was ""crucial"" the Lords amendment remained:"
2018-06-08,Trump isolated as G7 summit begins,https://web.archive.org//web/20180608232930/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-44409775,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowDivisions between Donald Trump and the other leaders of the G7 nations have been laid bare at a summit in Canada.The US president said Russia should be readmitted to the group of major industrialised nations following its expulsion for annexing Crimea.But German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the EU members attending the summit all agreed that should not happen.Meanwhile, Canada has called Mr Trump's trade tariffs ""illegal"".Another of the attendees, European Council President Donald Tusk, warned that Mr Trump's stance on trade, climate change and Iran constituted a real danger.""What worries me most however is the fact that the rules-based international order is being challenged, quite surprisingly not by the usual suspects but by its main architect and guarantor: the US,"" he said. After rumours there would be no joint closing statement because of the divisions, President Trump told reporters he believed there would be one after all.The G7 summit, which groups Canada, the US, the UK, France, Italy, Japan and Germany, is being held in the town of La Malbaie in Quebec, Canada. The leaders of the nations, which represent more than 60% of global net worth, meet annually. Economics tops the agenda, although the meetings now always branch off to cover major global issues.Mr Trump said he regretted the meeting had shrunk in size.""You know, whether you like it or not - and it may not be politically correct - but we have a world to run and in the G7, which used to be the G8, they threw Russia out,"" he said. ""They should let Russia come back in.""He found support in the shape of the newly installed Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, who tweeted that it was ""in the interests of everyone"" for Russia to be readmitted. But later Germany's Angela Merkel said all the EU members there, including Mr Conte, had agreed that Russia could not be readmitted unless there was ""progress"" on Ukraine.  Canada too says it remains opposed.A Kremlin spokesperson meanwhile said they were interested in ""other formats"", apart from the G7.Russian President Vladimir Putin is currently in Beijing, where he was presented with a friendship medal by Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping.Fellow members of what was then the G8 suspended Russia after it took control of Crimea from Ukraine. Tensions remain, in part over the poisoning of a former Russian spy in the UK.By the BBC's diplomatic correspondent, James RobbinsRelations between Donald Trump and America's leading allies were already at a new low over trade tariffs before the president casually dropped his Russia hand-grenade. Most G7 leaders think the decision to expel Russia in 2014 was right then, and remains right today. Even Russia itself seems lukewarm about rejoining. In many ways, this seems to be a deliberate Donald Trump tactic, to distract attention from his war of words with the rest of the G7 over trade and protectionism. President Trump dislikes the whole idea of the G7: a club of nations which traditionally comes together around shared values rooted in a world order based on agreed rules. Last to arrive, he'll also be first to leave.Mr Trump's imposition of tariffs has sparked anger, with even US allies falling subject to them. The move has brought fears of a trade war.Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said ""Canada will not change its mind when it comes to the illegal and absolutely unjustified application of tariffs on steel and aluminium"".Mr Trump said on Friday that the US and Canada were working on cutting tariffs ""and making it all very fair for both countries"". ""We've made a lot progress today,"" he said, adding that the relationship between the two countries ""is probably better than ever"". Looking forward to straightening out unfair Trade Deals with the G-7 countries. If it doesn’t happen, we come out even better!End of Twitter post  by @realDonaldTrumpUK Prime Minister Theresa May has said she wants the EU to act with restraint and proportion in retaliating to the US tariffs.Unlike Mr Macron and Mr Trudeau, she will not be having a bilateral meeting with Mr Trump but insisted on Friday it was not a snub.Mr Trump is leaving early to head to Singapore for his landmark summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, meaning he will miss some of the topics advanced by Mr Trudeau.The five themes for this year's summit are: According to the leaders' programme, Mr Trump will be around for the economic and security issues being discussed on Friday but will miss climate change, the environment and probably gender equality on Saturday.Pursuing the conversation. Engaging, keeping the dialogue alive, now & ever. Sharing, reaching out, always, to promote the interests of the French people, and all those who believe in a world we can build together. With President Donald Trump, prior to the opening of G7 Summit. pic.twitter.com/SD5hzLBO0XEnd of Twitter post  by @EmmanuelMacronThe US president was very much the odd man out on climate change during the G7 in Italy last year, later announcing his intention to withdraw from the landmark Paris agreement.Iran is also a big sticking point. Mr Trump recently ditched the 2015 agreement with Tehran that aimed to curb its nuclear programme. This angered the other signatories who have since sought to shore it up.Previous G7 meetings have seen huge protests, and about 8,000 soldiers and police officers are expected to be on hand during the Quebec event."
2018-06-08,Brexit bill 'uncharted territory' warning,https://web.archive.org//web/20180608232930/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-44410939,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowNicola Sturgeon has warned the UK government that pushing through the Brexit bill without Holyrood's consent would put the UK into ""uncharted"" constitutional territory.MPs in the House of Commons are expected to hold a final vote on the EU Withdrawal Bill next week. But there is still no agreement between the Scottish and UK governments over the devolved elements of the bill. UK government sources told BBC Scotland they are likely to press on regardless. The Scottish Parliament voted against giving its formal consent to the bill last month, with Labour MSPs, Liberal Democrats and the Scottish Greens supporting the SNP's stance.Months of talks between the Westminster and Holyrood governments have failed to find a solution to the dispute, despite the Welsh government agreeing a deal that ended its opposition to the proposals. Ms Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, said ignoring the result of the Holyrood vote would ""rip up"" the convention that the UK Parliament will not legislate in devolved areas without the consent of the devolved parliament.There is no constitutional reason why the UK government cannot do so, but it would be politically difficult for the prime minister. Ms Sturgeon told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme that the move would be ""regrettable"" and would take the country into uncharted constitutional territory. And she predicted the implications of Westminster ""seeking to impose"" unpopular policies in devolved areas after Brexit would be ""hugely significant"".She added: ""I hope the Westminster government even at this late stage will respect the Scottish Parliament because I don't know where it takes us if they are prepared to rip up this convention. ""It takes us into uncharted territory and I think it will be a seriously retrograde step.""Decision time is looming for the Conservative government. They can respect the Scottish Parliament or they can do what a lot of people in Scotland have long suspected - prove that they can't be trusted with devolution.""Ms Sturgeon was speaking as delegates gathered in Aberdeen for the SNP's two-day spring conference, which she will being to a close with her speech on Saturday afternoon. The conference opened with the result of the party's deputy leadership contest being announced, with Economy Secretary Keith Brown winning the contest to succeed Angus Robertson in the role. The UK government has published proposals that would see the ""vast majority"" of the 158 areas where policy in devolved areas is currently decided in Brussels go directly to the Scottish and Welsh parliaments after Brexit.But it has also named 24 areas where it wants to retain power temporarily in the wake of Britain's exit from the EU, including in areas such as agriculture, fisheries, food labelling and public procurement.It says the ""temporary restriction"" on the devolved governments using some of the powers returning from the EU is needed ""to help ensure an orderly departure from EU law"" and allow the same rule and regulations to remain in place across the whole of the UK.But the Scottish government argues that it would leave Holyrood unable to pass laws in some devolved areas for up to seven years.It has produced its own alternative Brexit legislation, which was passed by MSPs in March but is currently subject to a legal challenge by the UK government.Read more here"
2018-06-08,Irish unity poll a 'bad idea' - Irish PM,https://web.archive.org//web/20180608232930/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-44406029,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAn Irish unity poll in Northern Ireland would be divisive and ""a bad idea"", Irish PM Leo Varadkar has said.On Thursday, former NI first minister Peter Robinson said any future border poll on Northern Ireland's future in the UK could not be conducted on the basis of a simple majority.He said the idea of a ""majority of one"" would lead to chaos.Mr Varadkar said ""a simple majority is enough"", but questioned whether that would be a ""good thing"". The taoiseach made his comment ahead of becoming the first Irish prime minister to visit the headquarters of the Orange Order in Belfast. ""I think a border poll would be defeated and very divisive,"" said Mr Varadkar.""We should be respecting the primacy of the Good Friday Agreement and, at the heart of the Good Friday Agreement, is power-sharing within Northern Ireland, ever-increasing cooperation within the north and south and peace in Britain and Ireland.""Mr Varadkar said that even though the Good Friday Agreement provides for a border poll to be carried by a majority of one, the time or the conditions were not right.""I think the focus should be on getting the institutions up and running again, rather than focusing on a border poll.""Efforts to restore power sharing in Northern Ireland have so far failed, after the Executive collapsed 17 months ago. Talks to get the Northern Ireland Assembly up and running failed in February with both Sinn Féin and the DUP blaming each other for an inability to strike a deal.It comes as a survey conducted for the BBC suggested that the prospect of Brexit may be having a significant impact on how some people in Northern Ireland regard their future.More than a quarter (28%) said the UK's decision to leave the EU has made them more likely to vote for a united Ireland.Speaking during a lecture at Queen's University in Belfast, Mr Robinson shared Mr Varadkar's views that the focus must be on restoring a power-sharing government in Northern Ireland.He  was appointed an honorary professor in peace studies in May. Mr Robinson served as the first minister of Northern Ireland from 2008 until he retired in January 2016.His inaugural lecture delivered on Thursday evening was entitled ""Negotiating the Way Forward: Restoring Government in Northern Ireland"".A number of academics have protested at his appointment to the non paid, part-time position, attached to the Senator George J Mitchell Institute for Global Peace, Security and Justice. Mr Robinson told the audience: ""The existing simplistic, majority-of-one, mechanism to deal with colossal constitutional change would be a recipe for chaos if ever it were to be activated.""It is better to deal with the process that would be involved, when there is no reason to anticipate an outcome that obliges change, rather than having to tackle the issue on the fly if it was ever to be triggered in the future.""In reference to the continuing deadlock preventing the return of a power-sharing executive in Northern Ireland he said the less well off are suffering the most:""A legion of decisions awaits Ministerial sign-off. These include matters vital to the public health, well being and prosperity.  ""Inescapably, it is the poor, the needy, the meek and humble who suffer most.""Talks aimed at restoring the Northern Ireland Executive collapsed in February with both Sinn Féin and the DUP blaming each other for failure to strike a deal.Mr Robinson said the next set of negotiations must feel like a ""settlement"" and not part of an ongoing process.He added it would not be possible for party leaders to bring all of their members with them on any potential agreement:""Let's be clear, not all of your colleagues, will want to make the necessary concessions.""That's where leadership comes in.""If you want support, you must not show any uncertainty. You must take ownership of the deal. Nobody can sell it better than you can,"" he added. He said that for a deal to be sold to the public, party leaders needed to become ""evangelists"" for it: ""Discipline is essential.  You and your team must be out there positively selling the benefits of the deal.  ""No matter how good the deal may be, it will not sell itself,"" he added.Among those listening to the speech was the current DUP leader Arlene Foster.She rejected a suggestion that the reference to leadership was criticism of her:""I think he was actually reflecting what happened in February because, of course, it was the very first time that there wasn't a soft landing.""In fact papers were released to the media, commentary was made on those papers and he is right about that.""It makes it a lot more difficult to put back together again and to build trust up again when something like that happens,"" she added."
2018-06-08,NHS staff vote for 6.5% pay deal,https://web.archive.org//web/20180608232930/https://www.bbc.com/news/health-44413436,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowMore than one million NHS workers in England will receive a three-year pay deal worth 6.5% after staff voted in favour of the offer.Hospital cleaners, nurses, security guards, physiotherapists, emergency call handlers, paramedics, midwives, radiographers and other NHS staff across England will receive the rise. They should now get the money in their July pay packets, backdated from April. Thirteen unions voted for the deal and one against.The only union to reject the deal was the GMB.The agreement covers all staff on the Agenda for Change contract - about 1.3m across the UK - which is the entire workforce with the exception of doctors, dentists and senior leaders.Sara Gorton, head of health at Unison, said the three-year pay deal must not be a ""one-off"".""Health workers will want to know that ministers are committed to decent wage rises across the NHS for the long term, and that this isn't just a quick fix.""Most importantly, the extra funding means the pay rise won't be at the expense of services or patient care,"" she said.It is expected that additional funding will now be made available for health budgets in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, allowing pay negotiations to take place for health workers there.GMB officials will meet next week to decide their next move after members rejected the deal by almost nine to one.Josie Irwin, of the Royal College of Nursing, said the deal would help to make the profession more attractive to future nurses.""We have taken a significant step on the journey towards fairer pay for NHS staff but there is much more to achieve, not least for the staff who deliver NHS services outside direct employment.""The government would be mistaken if it thought today's deal was the end, rather than the beginning, of that journey.""The Royal College of Midwives called it ""the best deal in the public sector"" because it is additionally funded and does not come out of existing NHS money.Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the pay rise was ""incredibly well-deserved for staff who have never worked harder"".Salaries will increase by between 6.5% and 29%, with some of the biggest increases for the lowest paid."
2018-06-08,Keith Brown elected SNP deputy leader,https://web.archive.org//web/20180608232930/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-44397652,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowKeith Brown has been elected as the SNP's new deputy leader as the party's conference opened in Aberdeen.Mr Brown, who is currently the Scottish government's economy secretary, succeeds former MP Angus Robertson in the role.He finished ahead of activist Julie Hepburn and Inverclyde councillor Chris McEleny in the contest.The winner was elected by party members after a series of hustings events were held across the country. Mr Brown won with 55% of the votes in the second round, with Ms Hepburn in second place. Mr McEleny was eliminated in the first round.After being announced as the new deputy leader, Mr Brown told the party's supporters to ""get ready"" for a second independence referendum.And he said the decision on when it might be held was in the ""safest of hands"" with Nicola Sturgeon - who has pledged to consider the timing this autumn, when more details about the UK's Brexit deal are known.He Brown also told the conference that he would chair the SNP's ""national assemblies"" on Scotland's future over the summer. The discussion groups were announced when the party unveiled its Grown Commission report on the potential economic options for an independent Scotland last month.Mr Brown, who was congratulated by Ms Sturgeon on the conference stage, also said he would engage with trade unions, business groups and civic Scotland about how to move beyond the ""damage and despair"" caused by Brexit. He told delegates: ""This is the party I joined more than three decades ago, the party I have campaigned for and the party I have been honoured to represent in local government, in Holyrood and as a cabinet secretary.""Today, as I take on this new responsibility, our party is in good heart - and the polls show us in a commanding position at both Holyrood and Westminster, 11 years into office.""While other parties bicker and fight, we work hard to represent the people of Scotland and win their support.""The two-day SNP conference is being held at the Aberdeen Exhibition and Conference Centre.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, the party's leader, will speak on Saturday afternoon. In her welcome notes in the conference guide, Ms Sturgeon says the event ""marks the start of a new chapter in Scotland's road to independence"". She also praises the party's long-awaited Growth Commission report, which was published a fortnight ago and examines the economic options for an independent Scotland.The 354-page report has received a mixed reception from independence supporters, with some expressing doubts about proposals to keep the pound and embark on a major deficit reduction programme in the first years after leaving the UK.Ms Sturgeon said the document was ""packed full of new ideas for Scotland's future"" and showed that ""with our opponents stuck quibbling grievances of the past, we've moved on to a debate about how we fulfil the potential of our country.""The Growth Commission report is not expected to be debated on the main conference floor - but will feature at a fringe event hosted by the Institute of Economic Affairs think-tank.Ms Sturgeon's speech is also not expected to reveal her thoughts on the timing of any new independence referendum.She has previously said she will do so in the autumn, once the implications of Brexit become clearer. Nicola Sturgeon may be happy to bide her time until the circumstances are more favourable toward a second independence vote. But many of her grassroots are getting restless. Huge rallies in recent weeks have attracted tens of thousands of enthusiastic supporters, many of whom march under the banner ""Independence Now"" and use the hashtag #readytogo. Ms Sturgeon galvanised them into action last year with her call for another referendum. And having marched them halfway up the hill, the SNP leader isn't sure how to get them down again.She would rather start a long and detailed conversation about the prospects and possibilities for an independent Scotland which is aimed at people who voted No in 2014. The Growth Commission plans have already prompted No voters to look at the arguments afresh, argues the first minister. Those same economic plans have also enraged many on the left of the Yes movement, who dismiss the emphasis on deficit reduction and tight public spending as ""austerity lite"".It may prove impossible to simultaneously reassure nervous No voters that independence is safe - while also exciting more idealistic Yes supporters about how radical it could be.Read more from SarahDelegates will debate issues including paternity leave, limiting executive pay, the situation in Gaza and women in the justice system.And there will be speeches from senior SNP figures including Deputy First Minister John Swinney, the party's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford. and Scotland's Brexit secretary, Michael Russell.Mr Blackford used his speech on Friday to argue that it would be a ""democratic outrage"" if the UK government forces through the EU Withdrawal Bill next week against the wishes of Holyrood.And he predicted the move would haunt the Tories for generations,MPs at the House of Commons will consider the key Brexit legislation next week.However the Scottish Parliament has already voted against giving its formal consent to the bill, with Labour MSPs, Liberal Democrats and the Scottish Greens supporting the SNP's stance.UK government sources have told BBC Scotland they are likely to push on with the devolution elements of the bill regardless.

""Theresa May has so many nooses dangling around her neck that one of those nooses is sure to hang her."" He was talking about splits in the prime minister's cabinet, the need to keep Northern Ireland's unionist DUP on board, UK business demands, EU red lines and Brexit negotiating time running out.""It could be the UK unintentionally crashing out of the EU with no deal simply because time runs out."" Eurocrats also bemoan the fact that the UK government hasn't - in their opinion - been straight with voters, many of whom now have unrealistic expectations about the outcome of Brexit negotiations. Why isn't that true?Well, says the EU, the European Single Market was designed to create frictionless trade between its members and close associates, like Norway. To benefit, you have to be one of the gang and respect club rules and restrictions. Note: Once you are out of the club, a free trade agreement is far from frictionless and the EU is an unapologetically hard-nosed trade negotiator. Fondly referred to here as Brexit's square-peg, round-hole issueThe government has refused to accept a Northern Ireland-specific arrangement. Brussels says a UK-wide customs deal alone won't do it.   Read more here:In an effort to bring some clarity to the debate - and to dispel allegations made by some in the UK, including the government's own chief Brexit negotiator, that Brussels is being difficult in negotiations to punish Britain for leaving - EU figures have become very fond of going back to Brexit basics. The UK, they say, is free to choose the type of relationship it wants with the EU: staying in or leaving; remaining closely aligned or more at arm's length with the bloc after Brexit. As long, says Brussels, as the shape of that relationship complies with EU rules as well as UK wishes since it will be an agreement between the two parties. But, insists Brussels, where the UK has no choice if it wants an agreement with the EU, is when it comes to the Irish border. I welcome publication of #UK proposal on customs aspects of IE/NI backstop. We will examine it with 3 questions: is it a workable solution to avoid a hard border? Does it respect the integrity of the SM/CU? Is it an all-weather backstop?End of Twitter post  by @MichelBarnierBack in December, the UK and EU signed up to ensuring there would be no re-introduction of a hard border on the island of Ireland in order to safeguard the Good Friday accord. This is the reddest of red lines for the EU. All its normally fractious members are in agreement. And while the future relationship between the EU and UK remains foggy and undecided, Brussels is insisting on a time-unlimited, rock-solid backstop agreement to ensure that, as a last resort, and whatever else happens in Brexit talks, there will be no new hard border. And this is where there is further confusion at the moment - so hold on to your seat. The UK government is talking about a backstop agreement too, but it is referring to what customs arrangement could be put in place for the whole of the UK until a new post-Brexit customs deal is up and operational. This alone will not cut the mustard with the EU over Ireland. So - if and when the UK government finally reaches agreement on what it desires as the future EU-UK relationship - the warning from Brussels is this: pay attention to the Irish border; whatever else is agreed it could still bring the whole Brexit deal crashing down.

Who is behind it?Best for Britain aims to persuade MPs to back a referendum on the final Brexit deal secured by Theresa May when they vote on it in the autumn, with staying in the EU an option on the ballot paper.It would aim to persuade enough Leave voters to change their mind to vote to keep Britain in the EU - but the first stage of its campaign aims to generate pressure for another referendum.Its campaign slogan - already displayed on billboards in London, Birmingham, Manchester and Liverpool and in newspaper ads - is ""We all deserve a final say on the Brexit deal.""According to the Observer, Best for Britain will send a ""roadmap"" to MPs and peers, setting out how they could stop Brexit, when it launches its campaign on Friday. The group believes a referendum could be held in December, or possibly as late as February or March - when the UK is set to officially quit the EU - if Brussels agrees to it.It is targeting much of its campaigning muscle at the Labour Party's front bench, which is against another referendum - but it also needs at least 10 Conservative ""rebels"" on board in order to win a vote in Parliament on an amendment calling for a referendum.The campaign is also attempting to shore up support among Labour backbenchers sceptical about Brexit and is reportedly targeting 50 Leave-supporting Labour constituencies with billboard ads close to MPs' offices. The campaign will also lobby the big trade unions in an effort to exert pressure on the Labour leadership and is running a social-media campaign and a ""Labour Against Brexit"" speaking tour by leading Labour Remainers. It is also funding a grassroots campaign and has handed cash to local volunteers to ""help stop Brexit in your area"". Best for Britain was set up in April 2017, just before June's snap general election. Its initial aim was to encourage tactical voting to try to get more pro-Remain MPs into the House of Commons. The group said more than a million people had consulted its tactical voting website ahead of 8 June to find pro-Remain candidates.It reported spending £353,118 between June 2016 and June 2017, and made donations to pro-European candidates in marginal seats, including the Lib Dems' Tom Brake, Labour's Peter Kyle and Green MP Caroline Lucas. One of the group's founding members, Gina Miller, defeated the government over its power to trigger Article 50 without parliamentary consent, in the Supreme Court in January 2017. However, she stood down the day after the 2017 general election, saying the group had become too party political.Officially registered as UK-EU Open Policy Limited, Best for Britain is led by business and charity sector figures. This is in contrast to the MP-led People's Vote campaign - which is also pushing for a referendum on the final Brexit deal, although the two campaigns will join forces on 23 June to stage a march on Parliament.Best for Britain has £2.4m in its coffers and is asking donors for another £3.2m to realise its campaigning ambitions, according to its director of communications, Paul Butters, a former spokesman for Tim Farron, the ex-Liberal Democrat leader.The biggest individual donor is international financier George Soros, a Hungarian-born US citizen, who has given Best for Britain £800,000 in total so far, with £400,000 of that coming since the start of the year through his pro-European Open Society Foundation.Having made his billions in finance, including betting against sterling on Black Wednesday in 1992 - which gained him a reputation as the ""man who broke the Bank of England"" - Mr Soros, 87, donated more than £8bn to philanthropic causes between 1979 and 2011.UK electoral law bans foreign donations but only in the run-up to elections or referendums. Best for Britain says it has not taken money from overseas because the Soros donations came via his Open Society Foundations UK branch. The campaign is also keen to stress that it has also raised significant sums from more than 8,000 small donors.But the involvement of Mr Soros has generated a backlash in the Brexit-backing media, with the Daily Mail telling him on its front page: ""Butt out Mr Soros. You can keep your tainted money.""Mr Soros hit back at the Daily Mail's headline in an article for the Mail on Sunday, explaining why his love for Britain had led him to campaign against the ""tragic mistake"" of Brexit - and the campaign launched a Gofundme crowdfunding page entitled Help Best for Britain fight the Daily Mail, which has raised more than £64,000 in the past 12 days.Pro-Brexit campaign Leave Means Leave is, meanwhile, raising funds to combat Best for Britain, with its co-chairman John Longworth telling supporters in an email: ""We are determined to secure the swift, clean Brexit you all voted for.""Best for Britain is currently under investigation by the Electoral Commission, which oversees campaign spending, for submitting a return with invoices missing and for failing to return a donation of £25,000 from an impermissible donor within 30 days. It says it has complied with all relevant regulations.Lord Malloch-Brown, appointed 2 November 2017. A former foreign office minister, under Gordon Brown, who became a life peer in July 2007. Before that, he served as UN deputy secretary general, and from 1977 to 1979 he was a political correspondent at the pro-EU Economist, returning in 1983 for three years as founding editor of the Economist Development Report.The 64-year-old peer sparked controversy when he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme last month that Britain might as well stay in the EU, given the impossibility of divorcing itself from the Continent's problems. He said: ""Britain's history as an island nation adjacent to mainland Europe is when we try to, sort of, pull away from Europe's problems and close ourselves off to them, they have a horrible habit of infecting us anyway - appeasement in the 1930s, you name it. For centuries, Britain has ignored events on continental Europe at its peril.""Chief executive officer: Eloise Todd, 41. Until December 2016, Ms Todd worked in Brussels as global director of U2 singer Bono's anti-poverty charity, One. She had worked in the European Parliament for seven years after graduating from the College of Europe in Bruges.The Guardian has suggested that it was her personal connection to Best for Britain's biggest donor, George Soros, through the international development sector, that attracted him to the group, instead of better-known campaigns such as Open Britain, which is now part of the People's Vote group.Director: Sir Clive Cowdery, appointed 16 December 2016. The insurance businessman founded the Resolution Foundation think tank in 2005. He was chairman and chief executive of General Electric Insurance Holdings from 1998 to 2003. Knighted in the 2016 New Year Honours for services to children and social mobility, Sir Clive, 55, is worth an estimated £147m, according to the Sunday Times Rich List 2018, in which he ranked 804th in Britain. Director: Shakuntala Ghosh, appointed 3 March 2017. Chief executive of the charity Clore Social Leadership, which runs management training courses for charity workers, since April 2015, ""Shaks"" Ghosh, 61, led homelessness charity Crisis from 1997 to 2007. She has also held posts at the National Housing Federation and Centrepoint.Chief economist: Anatole Kaletsky, appointed 16 December 2016. Another former Economist journalist, Mr Kaletsky was appointed chairman of the Institute for New Economic Thinking in 2012, a foundation established after the 2008 financial crisis with $200m (£150m) of grants from, among others, George Soros. In 2010, he wrote Capitalism 4.0: The Birth of a New Economy in the Aftermath of Crisis.Director: Peter Norris, appointed 16 December 2016. Known as Sir Richard Branson's right-hand man, Mr Norris, 63, has been chairman of the Virgin Group since 2001. Sir Richard donated £25,000 and office space to the campaign in 2017 to help launch it. Before Virgin, Mr Norris was chief executive of Barings Bank when it collapsed in the Nick Leeson ""rogue trader"" scandal in 1995. He was temporarily banned from being a director by the Department of Trade and Industry in 1998.Director: Stephen Peel, appointed 19 October 2016. A former Goldman Sachs executive who represented Great Britain in rowing at the 1988 Seoul Olympics, Mr Peel, 52, has donated more than £75,000 to Best for Britain.Gina Miller: The businesswoman and philanthropist initially spearheaded Best for Britain, saying in her launch speech: ""Throughout the course of this general election campaign, we will be focusing on educating and empowering people to make a tactical vote and choosing MPs who will do the best for Britain. ""   But she stood down the day after the 2017 general election and has distanced herself from the group, saying it had become more focused on ""bringing down the Tories"" than Brexit.Alan Milburn: Chairman of the Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission from 2012 to 2017, the 60-year-old served in Tony Blair's government, as chief secretary to the Treasury from 1998 to 1999, then as secretary of state for health until 2003. He has been chancellor of Lancaster University since 2015. He resigned from Best of Britain on 3 March 2017.Sally Tallant: The director of the Liverpool Biennial festival of contemporary art, Sally Tallant, 50, resigned from the group in April 2017."
2018-06-08,Brexit: Key dates,https://web.archive.org//web/20180608232930/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44374613,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe countdown to Britain's planned departure from the EU is under way - here are the key dates and parliamentary battles on the road to Brexit.Ratification of the withdrawal agreement by the UK Parliament and the European Parliament. One of the key Brexit laws will return to the House of Commons this week. MPs will have to decide whether to accept or reject changes made to the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill by the House of Lords. Peers inflicted an unprecedented 15 defeats on the government in April and May on issues ranging from a customs union to environmental protection.There has been a lot of debate over whether Theresa May has enough Conservative colleagues onside to avoid damaging defeats on the Withdrawal Bill. But this is just one of the parliamentary hoops the government has to jump through before Brexit day. What is it?A law that will repeal the European Communities Act which brought the UK into the EU in 1972, and copy EU laws and regulations that are currently in force into UK law.It will also give ministers powers to make small changes to laws and regulations without having to bring a whole new bill to Parliament. This is one of the powers that opponents have feared could be open to abuse. When?The bill entered Parliament in July 2017 and has slowly made its way through both the House of Commons and Lords. After the government lost 15 votes on changes to the proposed bill in the Lords, MPs will now debate and vote on the changes. The bill will go back and forth between the two houses until there are no more changes being made, in a process known as ""ping-pong"".Potential flashpointsIf Mrs May's government fails to win enough votes in the Commons, the bill could be passed with some significant conditions attached. One of the most high-profile changes would require the government to report to Parliament on its effort to negotiate a customs union - something that has been ruled out by the PM.Please upgrade your browserWhat are they?In last year's Queen's Speech, the government announced eight Brexit laws that will be needed to prepare the country before it leaves the EU. Some of these have begun their journey through Parliament, but many of them are not even published yet, including a Fisheries Bill, Migration Bill and Agriculture Bill - all areas that will need significant new legislation once we are no longer under European jurisdiction. The two most high-profile are the Trade Bill and the Taxation (Cross-Border Trade) Bill, also known as the Customs Bill. When? Good question. The government has been criticised for its slow progress on key legislation. The Customs and Trade Bills have both passed the first stages in the House of Commons but no date is set for their return, perhaps because the next stage will involve crunch votes on the customs union that Mrs May could lose.Potential flashpointsWhen the Trade Bill returns to the Commons, MPs will vote on an amendment tabled by Conservative MP Anna Soubry. If passed, the amendment would force the government to make it an ""objective"" to take ""all necessary steps"" to set up a customs union between the UK and EU. This is much stronger wording than the amendment to the Withdrawal Bill and defeat would be a significant blow to Mrs May's plans.What is it?MPs will have a vote on the final withdrawal agreement and the framework for the future partnership once they've been negotiated with the EU. This is the ""meaningful vote"" promised to MPs by the prime minister. Brexit Secretary David Davis has said the vote will be on a motion that can be amended and that the government will treat the result as binding.When?Soon after the withdrawal agreement has been finalised (expected by the end of October 2018). Mr Davis has said the vote will take place before the European Parliament votes on the agreement. Potential flashpointsThis is potentially the biggest threat to the government's plans. Ministers have presented the vote as a decision between approving their withdrawal agreement and ""no deal"". If MPs can amend the motion, they could put conditions on the withdrawal agreement. The Lords added an amendment which would potentially give MPs even more power. Under that proposal they could direct the government on how it should act if the withdrawal agreement is rejected.What is it?Another bill that needs to be passed before the UK leaves the EU. It will enshrine the withdrawal agreement in law and give legal effect to whatever transition period is agreed. The difference between this and the motion in Parliament is that the motion is there to approve the withdrawal agreement while the bill is there to implement it. When?The bill cannot be written until there is a withdrawal agreement and it must be passed before Brexit day (29 March 2019). MPs complicated the process in December when they passed an amendment to the Withdrawal Bill - proposed by Conservative MP Dominic Grieve - that would require this bill to be passed before the government can use secondary legislation to implement Brexit. This means the vote on this bill will act as another ""meaningful vote"".Potential flashpointsIt is unclear what would happen if Parliament rejects the Withdrawal and Implementation Bill.What is it?Under the Withdrawal Bill, the government has the power to make changes to laws that need to happen before Brexit day. This is called secondary legislation and is often used to make small technical changes to laws. But opposition politicians have warned that excessive use of these powers could be undemocratic. When?The powers are contained in the Withdrawal Bill. But after MPs voted for Mr Grieve's amendment, ministers will not be allowed to use the powers until the Withdrawal and Implementation Bill has been passed.What is it?The final withdrawal agreement will have to be ratified as an international treaty. The government has to present international treaties to both houses of Parliament. If neither house raises objections, the treaty is passed and does not necessarily have to be debated or voted on. If there is an objection, ministers have 21 days to explain the merits of the treaty, before presenting it to Parliament again. This could technically be repeated multiple times.When?Mr Davis has said the treaty will have to be ratified before the withdrawal agreement can ""enter into force"".Potential flashpointsIt is unlikely that there would be a vote - or even a debate - on the treaty, seeing as the issues will have already been debated and voted on in the meaningful vote. Theoretically, Parliament could vote against the treaty, but it will not be able to amend it.The UK and EU have to agree on the terms of the UK's departure - as well as what sort of trading relationship they will have after Brexit. The UK is hoping an agreement can be reached on both of these elements at the EU summit in October.The government has promised a white paper setting out in detail what it wants from Brexit - but its publication has been delayed while wrangling goes on behind the scenes about what to put in it.There is expected to be a ""political declaration"" on the framework for future UK-EU relations after the October summit. MPs will then be given a vote on the withdrawal agreement before it goes to the European Parliament for ratification.But a number of sticking points remain - and all have to be resolved before the withdrawal agreement can be signed off and put to a vote. Here are the main issues that need to be sorted out (there are a lot of smaller ones too - you can read more about those here).This is the biggest sticking point.Both sides have committed to avoiding the return of a hard border, including physical infrastructure or related checks and controls, between Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.They want to achieve this by agreeing a comprehensive free trade deal with the continuation of open borders.But that could be difficult if the UK government sticks to its policy of leaving the EU single market and customs union.The UK government is working on two possible solutions - a ""customs partnership"", which would see the UK collecting tariffs on behalf of the EU, and ""maximum facilitation"", which would use new technology to track goods passing across the border.The EU has previously rejected both ideas.If all else fails, Brussels has proposed a ""backstop"" solution - which would see Northern Ireland stick to those rules of the customs union and single market that are required for cross-border co-operation to continue.But the UK government is against this idea, saying it would effectively separate Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK and create a border in the Irish Sea.Mrs May also wants an insurance policy to maintain an invisible border if trade talks break down. She is expected to set out details of her ""backstop"" proposal in due course, having seen her previous suggestion rejected by Brussels.The UK has set a lot of store by establishing a high level of co-operation on security issues, like counter-terrorism and the fight against organised crime, with the EU after Brexit. But there are significant disagreements about how this will work - and the EU's decision to exclude the UK from the Galileo satellite system on security grounds has poisoned the atmosphere, with the UK claiming it shows a lack of trust.The UK thinks that co-operation on extradition, the British relationship with the EU crime-fighting agency Europol and the sharing of criminal records should be the subject of a separate security treaty which the two sides should begin negotiating straight away.This is another issue that could bring the whole deal down, according to Michel Barnier.The UK is committed to pulling out of the European Court of Justice, the mechanism used to settle disputes between member states by interpreting and enforcing single market rules.The EU has proposed a joint committee made up of representatives appointed by London and Brussels. If they can't solve a problem, it would be referred to the European Court of Justice.The UK government likes the idea of a joint committee but not of the European Court of Justice having the final say.British companies hold all sorts of personal data belonging to EU citizens, and the European Commission thinks that European data protection laws should continue to apply to it after Brexit.The UK would like a comprehensive deal on data-sharing with the EU as part of the discussions about the future relationship, and is wary of agreeing divorce-related measures that could tie its hands.The EU wants the UK to share customs data for three years and information about certain taxes for five years after the end of the transition period.This is how the Brexit process is meant to go - but the UK or the EU could pull the plug on talks at any time. And, in theory, the UK and the other 27 EU members could agree to change the timetable or even halt the process Brexit altogether.As the European Commission likes to say, ""nothing is agreed until everything is agreed""."

She was a very strong person,"" Dame Margaret Beckett told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.The former foreign secretary described how Lady Wilson had cared for Harold and helped to ""maintain his dignity"" during his long battle with Alzheimer's disease, which ended in his death in 1995.""She was a really, really lovely person and I am very sorry she is gone,"" added Dame Margaret.My love you have stumbled slowlyOn the quiet way to deathAnd you lie where the wind blows stronglyWith a salty spray on its breath.For this men of the island bore you Down paths where the branches meetAnd the only sounds were the crunching grindOf the gravel beneath their feet And the sighing slide of the ebbing tideOn the beach where the breakers meetThe daughter of a reverend, she was born Gladys Mary Baldwin in the Norfolk town of Diss in January 1916.She wrote poetry from the age of six and became a shorthand typist in Cheshire after leaving school, meeting her future husband at a tennis club in the area in 1934.The pair married on New Year's Day in 1940, when Harold was working as a senior civil servant at the Ministry of Fuel and Power.She was at his side during his rise to prominence in the Labour Party but tended to shun the limelight during their years in Downing Street.At her husband's farewell party in March 1976, cabinet minister Tony Benn told her she would now be able to have a quiet life. ""I have done my best,"" she replied, ""but I now just want to slip back into obscurity again.""The Wilsons had homes in London and the Isles of Scilly, where Mary continued to holiday into her late 90s.They had two sons, Robin and Giles, the former now an emeritus professor in mathematics at the Open University, which was founded under his father's government in the 1960s.Leading tributes to Lady Wilson, Jeremy Corbyn wrote on Twitter: ""Sad to hear of the death of Mary Wilson. A wonderful poet and a huge support in Harold's General Election victories. I send my condolences to her family and friends."""
2018-06-08,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20180608232930/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks have now moved on to future relations - after agreement was reached on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree within six months on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide, but first let's go back to the basics...It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.1% in the first three months of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.4%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand near a 40-year year low of 4.2%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 4.2% in the year to March 2018, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May is seeking to put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. If passed, it will end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, is supposed to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each playing roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanAn agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement wopuld only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.The full details are not yet known but UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72.We don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pounds buy fewer euros. A slump in the value of the dollar means the exchange rate with the pound is pretty close to where it was before the referendum.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.The UK has proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.A method for calculating the bill has been agreed, but the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more.The question of how and when payments will be made still needs to resolved, but it will be a schedule lasting for many years to come, and it is highly unlikely that anyone will ever be able to give an exact figure for the size of the divorce bill.UK sources say it will be up to £40bn, but some EU sources expect it to be higher than that. No-one can say for sure, and both sides want to keep it that way.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 6.5% in 2016 to 2.7% in 2017, according to the Halifax. It said the slowdown was driven by a squeeze on real wage growth.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-06-08,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180608232930/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to £840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

As I write, Mrs May is holed up with her advisers inside Tory HQ. But a former minister Anna Soubry has called for her to ""consider her position"" - political code for calling for her to resign.

On the two previous occasions in 1970 and February 1974 the PM and the party lost office. While there is no other conceivable administration in the new parliament other than a Conservative-led one, it remains to be seen whether the PM will retain her position. However, so long as the Conservatives can reach an accommodation with the DUP they will have a working majority in the House of Commons.  BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed:When the general election exit poll was revealed at 10pm, the pound immediately dropped by 2% as investors took a position that a hung parliament was a possible outcome of the general election.Why would that cause the currency to decline? Because a hung parliament means that the government's direction of travel would be less certain.

2018-06-09,May says G7 will act over 'malign' Russia,https://web.archive.org//web/20180609235544/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-44427668,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe G7 will take further action against Russia if it continues to interfere in other countries' internal affairs, Prime Minister Theresa May has said.Leaders were sending ""a clear message that such malign activity will never be tolerated"" after the poisoning of the Russia ex-spy Sergei Skripal, she said.Mrs May also said the EU would impose countermeasures after the US imposed tariffs on imported metal products.But the prime minister warned against a ""tit-for-tat"" response.Ahead of the summit in Quebec, US President Donald Trump had called for the G7 to re-admit Russia. But Mrs May said Russia needed to ""change their ways"" before being invited back into the group.Russia was expelled in 2014 in response to its annexation of Crimea. ""If there are to be any conversations about Russia's future in relation to this particular group, they have to change their ways, they have to change the route that they are taking and the sort of activity they are involved in,"" Mrs May said.Relations between the UK and Russia have been under immense strain since the Salisbury nerve agent attack on Mr Skripal and his daughter Yulia in March.Mrs May has been attempting to build an alliance against Russia while at the G7. In her speech, she welcomed the joint communiqué by world leaders, which criticised Russia's attempts to ""undermine democratic systems"".The communiqué also endorsed the UK's assessment that Russia was responsible for the nerve agent attack.During the gathering, the US president repeated his call for Vladimir Putin to join the other leaders around the summit table.""I think it would be an asset to have Russia back in,"" Mr Trump said.""I think it would be good for the world, I think it would be good for Russia, I think it would be good for the United States, I think it would be good for all the countries of the current G7,"" he said.""Where we disagree with our allies on something it is right that we say so and air the issue openly and frankly,"" said Mrs May, speaking at the close of the summit. ""We have done just that at this summit, registering our deep disappointment at the unjustified decision by the US to apply tariffs to EU steel and aluminium imports.""Earlier this month, the US imposed a 25% tariff on steel and 10% on aluminium imports from the EU, Canada, and Mexico, with Mr Trump saying tariffs were needed to reverse America's trade deficit.Mrs May said the EU would impose countermeasures, something Mr Trump has warned against.The EU has already announced tariffs on US goods ranging from Harley-Davidson motorcycles to bourbon. But the prime minister warned that we ""need to avoid continued tit-for-tat escalation"" and maintain a constructive dialogue.""There have been some difficult conversations and strong debates but by working together we have agreed an outline to shape a better future,"" Mrs May said."
2018-06-09,Firms to be forced to justify pay gap,https://web.archive.org//web/20180609235544/https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44417629,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe country's biggest public businesses may soon have to publish the gap between the pay of their chief executive and an average worker.Business Secretary Greg Clark says directors of all companies with more than 250 employees will be required to disclose and explain this difference - known as the ""pay ratio"".Equal pay campaigners, business and investor groups welcomed the plan.But the TUC said it was ""a first step"" and even tougher rules were needed.In recent years shareholders have become increasingly vocal over executive pay levels, and have voted against what they see as excessive pay awards, most notably the high sums paid to former WPP boss, Sir Martin Sorrell. But top level remuneration, particularly chief executives, is often linked to the performance of the share price. The new rules, as well as introducing the publication of pay ratios, will also require listed companies to show what effect an increase in share prices will have on executive pay, in order to inform shareholders when voting on long-term incentive plans. The plans, which will be presented to Parliament on Monday, follow concerns that some chief executives have been receiving salaries that are out of step with company performance.Mr Clark said: ""Most of the UK's largest companies get their business practices right, but we understand the anger of workers and shareholders when bosses' pay is out of step with company performance.""The plans were welcomed by the Investment Association - that represents UK investment managers - as well as business lobby group the CBI and think tank the High Pay Centre. Chris Cummings, chief executive of the Investment Association, said investors wanted greater director accountability and more transparency over executive remuneration.""Investors will expect boards to articulate why the ratio is right for the company and how directors are fulfilling their duties,"" he said.The director of the High Pay Centre, Luke Hildyard, said pay ratios could prove useful to investors, workers and society more broadly.""We hope that [the move] will initiate a more informed debate about what represents fair, proportionate pay for workers at all levels,"" he said.The Confederation of British Industry's Matthew Fell said high pay was only ever justified by outstanding performance: ""This legislation can help to develop a better dialogue between boards and employees about the goals and aspirations of their business, and how pay is determined to achieve this shared vision.""TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady called for guaranteed places for worker representatives on boardroom pay committees, saying they would bring ""common sense and fairness to decision-making when boardroom pay packets are approved"".If approved, the regulations will come into effect from the start of next year, meaning companies will start reporting their pay ratios in 2020."
2018-06-09,Sturgeon announces 'immediate' NHS pay rise,https://web.archive.org//web/20180609235544/https://www.bbc.com/news/44417739,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe majority of NHS Scotland staff will receive a 3% pay rise this year, Nicola Sturgeon has announced.She told the SNP conference that staff currently earning up to £80,000 will receive at least a 3% increase.And she pledged that the ""immediate"" pay rise ""will be in their pay packets next month"".She said the move meant the vast majority of frontline NHS Scotland staff will be paid more than in NHS England.It was confirmed on Friday that more than a million NHS workers in England will receive a three-year pay deal worth 6.5% after staff voted in favour of the offer. They will also get the money in their July pay packets, backdated from April.Ms Sturgeon also used her speech to contrast the ""shambolic"" UK government with her party's achievements at Holyrood.She repeated her call for immigration policy to be devolved to the Scottish Parliament. And she announced 750 new or refurbished nurseries to help deliver an increase in free pre-school provision, and more funding for students who have been in care.But she gave no details of when a second Scottish independence referendum could be held.Ms Sturgeon was speaking as the two-day conference in Aberdeen drew to a close.Ms Sturgeon told delegates that the past few years of pay restraint had been ""tough"" on NHS staff and other public service workers.She added: ""We're currently in negotiations to agree a three year pay deal for NHS staff in which we aim to not just match but exceed the deal agreed in England. I hope these talks reach a positive conclusion soon.""But I don't want those working so hard in the NHS to have to wait for that agreement to get a pay rise this year. So I can announce today that we will make a payment on account as negotiations continue.""Staff currently earning up to £80,000 will receive at least a 3% uplift, and those earning £80,000 and over will receive a flat rate increase of £1,600. Staff not at the top of their pay bands will also receive any incremental progression they are due.The announcement will benefit 147,000 Agenda for Change staff, such as nurses, midwives, allied health professionals, therapists, paramedics, support staff and administrators. Ms Sturgeon said the move would mean auxiliary nurses in Scotland with a year's experience in Band 4 would be over £800 a year better off than those in England, and nurses with five years' experience in Band 5 £400 better off.In her speech the first minister urged supporters to focus not just on the ""when"" of a second independence referendum, but also to ""use our energy and passion to persuade those who still ask 'why?'"".Ms Sturgeon did not directly address the potential timing of any referendum, having previously pledged to do so in the autumn when the implications of Brexit become clearer.The SNP conference has been a slightly subdued affair this year, with a heavy focus on the technicalities of the party's internal constitution rather than rhetoric about the national one. But Nicola Sturgeon's keynote speech can always be relied upon to get the faithful on their feet.There was a hefty dollop of ""day job"" material, from nurseries and tuition fees to a big announcement on NHS pay.But the memorable moments in the speech were red meat for the masses of the SNP membership - attacks on the ""shambles"" of a Westminster government and assurances that independence is closer than ever.Is it? In terms of timetabling for a referendum, no. The telling moment was when Ms Sturgeon urged her troops not to focus just on the 'when' of independence, but to work on winning people over to the 'why' of it, ""as we wait for the fog of Brexit to clear"".In terms of winning the argument, then? SNP members are heading off to a series of ""national assemblies"" to discuss the growth commission report on the economy. But their votes are in the bag already. The greater question is what the rest of the country makes of it.Ms Sturgeon praised her party's recent Growth Commission report, which she said ""doesn't shy away from challenges"" or ""pretend there are always easy answers"".And she said the document ""lays strong foundations"" for independence and ""offers a brighter future than Brexit and Westminster austerity"".The report was met with a mixed response from independence supporters when it was published a fortnight ago.It examines the economic options for an independent Scotland, and proposes keeping the pound and embarking on a major deficit reduction programme in the first years after leaving the UK.The first minister claimed that the ""shambolic Westminster Tory government is holding Scotland back, while the Scottish government is moving Scotland forwards"".And she highlighted the ""disastrous"" impact she believes the UK government's ""hostile migration policy"" is having on Scotland's public services and economy.Ms Sturgeon added: ""Scotland is a welcoming country - our prosperity and our public services depend on it.""If Westminster cannot or will not act in our best interests, it is time that our own parliament was able to do so. It's time for powers over migration to come to Scotland.""Pro-independence Catalan politician Clara Ponsati, who is fighting a legal battle against being extradited from Scotland to Spain, spoke directly before Ms Sturgeon. Prof Ponsati thanked her Scottish supporters Scots for their ""overwhelming"" backing in her fight, and told the conference: ""I am really overwhelmed by the affection and the support I have received since I put my feet back in Scottish territory.""What you are doing is showing your belief in democracy and human rights. Catalans are deeply grateful to you for that.""Prof Ponsati has been accused by the Spanish authorities of rebellion - defined under Spanish law as being involved in a violent uprising - and misappropriation of public funds for her role in the Catalan referendum.The conference opened on Friday morning with Keith Brown being confirmed as the SNP's new deputy leader following a vote by party members. Mr Brown, who is also Scotland's economy secretary, succeeds former MP Angus Robertson in role after finishing ahead of activist Julie Hepburn and Inverclyde councillor Chris McEleny in the contest."

""After that, I'll be bringing my ministers together for an away day at Chequers to finalise the white paper we're going to be publishing.""And then before Parliament breaks for the summer, we'll be bringing the Trade and Customs Bill back to the House of Commons. ""Throughout all of that time, the negotiations will be continuing.""Please upgrade your browserIn response, Mr Corbyn said that Parliament should take control and set negotiating priorities because the ""divided and chaotic government"" had failed.""The government promised a 'detailed, ambitious and precise' Brexit White Paper this month setting out their negotiating priorities. Once again it's been postponed,"" he said,""The Tories are botching Brexit and risking jobs and our economy in the process.""This week's events have once again highlighted the gulf of opinion in the cabinet over Brexit.On Thursday, Mrs May was forced to agree to an ""expected end date"" of December 2021 for any interim arrangements after Brexit Secretary David Davis threatened to resign over the wording of the UK's proposed temporary customs agreement - the so-called backstop.The proposal would see the UK match EU trade tariffs temporarily in order to avoid a hard Irish border post-Brexit.That row was followed by comments from the Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - recorded at a private dinner - where he warned of a Brexit meltdown, and said issues around the Irish border were mistakenly being allowed to dominate proceedings.Mr Johnson also branded the Treasury - and, by implication, Chancellor Philip Hammond, ""the heart of remain"".Responding to his comments, Mrs May said: ""The foreign secretary has strong views on Brexit, but so do I. That's why I'm getting on with delivering Brexit.""But on Friday EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier criticised Mrs May's proposals for a customs arrangement. He stressed that he was not rejecting the UK prime minister's ideas - but said any ""backstop"" to prevent a hard Irish border could not be time-limited.Mr Barnier said the UK paper ""raises more questions than it answers"" but would be examined ""objectively"".Mrs May told the BBC: ""This is a negotiation, Michel Barnier has said exactly that point.""We have put a proposal on the table, on this backstop relating to Northern Ireland, we will now sit down and negotiate it with the European Union."""

The UK proposal was was drawn up after a row in cabinet in which Brexit Secretary David Davis reportedly threatened to resign.By BBC Political Correspondent Alex ForsythThis temporary ""backstop"" is meant to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland by kicking in if alternative customs arrangements can't be negotiated and implemented in time for the end of the transition period in December 2020. The EU's version would see Northern Ireland stay in the EU customs union, meaning a customs border in the Irish Sea. That is wholly unacceptable to Theresa May  - and the DUP who back her in parliament. So the prime minister proposed an alternative which would see the whole of the UK match EU tariffs. Today Mr Barnier suggested that would be problematic. And he raised concerns about the fact it would be time-limited; something key Brexiteers are demanding because they don't want the UK to stay closely tied to the EU indefinitely. So while the EU's chief negotiator didn't rule out the UK's proposal altogether, he certainly poured cold water on it. So far it seems agreement - even on the fallback option - is proving pretty tricky.He said the UK's proposals would be measured against three questions - whether it was a ""workable solution"" to avoiding a hard border, whether it respected the integrity of the single market and customs union and whether it was what he called an ""all weather backstop"".Please upgrade your browserThe EU's proposal, he told a press conference in Brussels, met these tests and that it was not necessarily ""feasible"" to extend the EU's offer of continued participation in key elements of the customs union in Northern Ireland to cover the whole of the UK.""Let me be clear: our backstop cannot be extended to the whole UK. Why? Because it has been designed for the specific situation of Northern Ireland.""He also stressed his preference for the EU's border in the Irish sea plan, saying: ""Checks carried out on ferries are less disruptive than along a 500km-long land border."" In addition, these checks can build on arrangements and facilities which already exist between the rest of the UK and Northern Ireland.""He said the ""time-limited"" nature of the UK proposal - with an ""expected"" end date of December 2021 - was also problematic.With a nod to Mrs May's famous ""Brexit means Brexit"" phrase, Mr Barnier said:  ""Backstop means backstop.""The temporary backstop is not in line with what we want or what Ireland and Northern Ireland want and need.""But later he tweeted that he was not rejecting the UK customs paper:To avoid any confusion between the EU backstop & the UK customs paper: I reiterate that our backstop cannot apply to whole UK. 4 freedoms are indivisible.  This is not a rejection of the UK customs paper on which discussions continue. #BrexitEnd of Twitter post  by @MichelBarnierIn a statement issued following Mr Barnier's press conference, Downing Street said: ""The prime minister has been clear that we will never accept a customs border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom. ""We are also committed to maintaining the integrity of our own internal market. That position will not change. The commission's proposals did not achieve this, which is why we have put forward our own backstop solutions for customs.""It added that all sides had agreed to ""protect the Belfast Agreement [Good Friday Agreement] in all its parts"".""Michel Barnier has confirmed today that discussions will now continue on our proposal.""Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, whose MPs back Mrs May's minority government, responded angrily to Mr Barnier's comments, which they said they showed the EU negotiator had ""no respect for the principle of consent or the constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom"". Deputy Leader Nigel Dodds said: ""This is nothing more than an outrageous attempt to revert to the annexation of Northern Ireland.  We will not accept such a proposal."" At the end of a turbulent week for Mrs May - in which she saw off the threat of a cabinet resignation over the UK's customs paper on Thursday - another cabinet Brexiteer, Boris Johnson, was recorded talking about Brexit in very candid terms at a private dinner.The foreign secretary said concerns about the Irish border had been overhyped and that Donald Trump might do a better job negotiating Brexit.In a recording obtained by Buzzfeed, he was said to have described the Irish border issue as ""pure millennium bug stuff"" and added: ""Imagine Trump doing Brexit.""He'd go in bloody hard... There'd be all sorts of breakdowns, all sorts of chaos. Everyone would think he'd gone mad. But actually you might get somewhere. It's a very, very good thought.""He also took a swipe at Chancellor Philip Hammond, calling the Treasury ""the heart of Remain"".Brexit-supporting Tory MPs applauded the foreign secretary but Mr Hammond said his ""advice to colleagues"" was to engage with the EU and to understand their concerns."

""We are also committed to maintaining the integrity of our own internal market. That position will not change. The commission's proposals did not achieve this, which is why we have put forward our own backstop solutions for customs.""It added that all sides had agreed to ""protect the Belfast Agreement [Good Friday Agreement] in all its parts"".""Michel Barnier has confirmed today that discussions will now continue on our proposal.""Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, whose MPs back Mrs May's minority government, responded angrily to Mr Barnier's comments, which they said they showed the EU negotiator had ""no respect for the principle of consent or the constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom"". Deputy Leader Nigel Dodds said: ""This is nothing more than an outrageous attempt to revert to the annexation of Northern Ireland.  We will not accept such a proposal."" At the end of a turbulent week for Mrs May - in which she saw off the threat of a cabinet resignation over the UK's customs paper on Thursday - another cabinet Brexiteer, Boris Johnson, was recorded talking about Brexit in very candid terms at a private dinner.The foreign secretary said concerns about the Irish border had been overhyped and that Donald Trump might do a better job negotiating Brexit.In a recording obtained by Buzzfeed, he was said to have described the Irish border issue as ""pure millennium bug stuff"" and added: ""Imagine Trump doing Brexit.""He'd go in bloody hard... There'd be all sorts of breakdowns, all sorts of chaos. Everyone would think he'd gone mad. But actually you might get somewhere. It's a very, very good thought.""He also took a swipe at Chancellor Philip Hammond, calling the Treasury ""the heart of Remain"".Brexit-supporting Tory MPs applauded the foreign secretary but Mr Hammond said his ""advice to colleagues"" was to engage with the EU and to understand their concerns."
2018-06-09,Welsh Labour's Corbyn-style leader vote review,https://web.archive.org//web/20180609235544/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-44414448,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowPlans for a special Welsh Labour conference to rule on how its next leader will be elected have been agreed by the party's ruling body.First Minister Carwyn Jones is stepping down in December.Under the current system his successor could win without a majority of votes from party members. But campaigners want all votes counted equally.The decision to hold the conference to discuss whether to make changes was made at a meeting on Saturday.It is expected to be held in September.Under the existing electoral college system the electorate is split into three sections - MPs and AMs, members, unions and affiliated groups - worth one-third of the vote each.Carolyn Harris' success in the Welsh Labour deputy leadership election, which came despite the MP losing a vote of the membership, renewed calls for change.The result galvanised supporters of one-member-one-vote (OMOV), who demanded the rules be overhauled before the leadership contest triggered by Mr Jones' planned departure.Advocates of OMOV say the system is more democratic, but those who support the electoral college argue it reflects the links the party has with trade unions.Carwyn Jones had backed a decision by the party to keep the existing electoral college system after a consultation last year.But, in a paper being considered by the Welsh Executive Committee when it meets on Saturday, the first minister proposes a ""democracy review"" of the party's structures to be split into two sections, with the first focusing purely on leadership election voting.He proposes this is completed before the leadership election, and calls for a special conference for 15 September to consider any rule changes required.The first minister said former Torfaen MP, Lord Murphy, should lead the review.Among the senior Welsh Government figures who support OMOV is Finance Secretary Mark Drakeford, the only AM interested in the leadership so far who has enough nominations to run.Debbie Wilcox, Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA) leader, said she changed her mind on the matter following the deputy leadership election.""I saw during the process, how difficult it is now to explain to residents, to people in the streets, how someone got so many more votes, and actually wasn't the person successful,"" she said.Health Secretary Vaughan Gething, who has announced his intention to stand but does not currently have enough nominations, said he did not want to see the future system ""diminish the voice of the trade union movement, the co-op party and our other affiliates"".However, advocates of OMOV say the system does not break the link with trade unions, saying under the system used in UK Labour every member who pays the political levy can vote on the same basis as a party member.Unison and GMB called for the say AMs and MPs have in the electoral college to be taken out or reduced.OMOV was used in the two elections which brought Jeremy Corbyn to the helm of the UK party.My understanding is that Carwyn Jones had initially hoped the review looking into whether the party should change its system of electing leaders wouldn't report back until after his successor was in place.In that regard he has clearly changed his mind, perhaps mindful of how the next leader could suffer in the face of opposition to how he or she got the top job.There seems to be widespread support that AMs and MPs should lose their special status and be counted as ordinary party members when it comes to voting for the leader.AMs, of course, decide who gets to stand in the first place.But breaking the connection with the unions, and their share of the electoral college vote, will not be so easy."
2018-06-09,UK lacks 'guts' in Brexit talks - Johnson,https://web.archive.org//web/20180609235544/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44407771,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowBoris Johnson has criticised the UK government's Brexit talks strategy, saying it lacks ""guts"" and suggested Donald Trump could do a better job.The foreign secretary also took a swipe at Chancellor Philip Hammond, calling the Treasury ""the heart of Remain"", in comments to a private dinner.He said the Brexit talks were heading for ""meltdown"" and Leave supporters may not get the deal they expected.Theresa May said Mr Johnson ""had strong views on Brexit but so do I"".Speaking in Canada, where she is attending the G7 summit, the prime minister refused to be drawn on whether the foreign secretary was undermining her, a day after a row with her Brexit Secretary David Davis. She said the process of leaving the EU was ""complex"" but her focus was on getting the right deal for Britain and people should judge her on her record in the negotiations so far. In a recording, obtained by Buzzfeed, Mr Johnson warns the UK could remain ""locked in orbit around the EU"" and claimed the Irish border issue - one of the main sticking points in talks with Brussels - had been allowed to dictate ""the whole of our agenda"".""It's so small and there are so few firms that actually use that border regularly, it's just beyond belief that we're allowing the tail to wag the dog in this way,"" he said.The foreign secretary was apparently speaking to around 20 people in a private room after an Institute of Directors reception on Wednesday night. It follows a day of wrangling over the government's ""backstop"" plan in the event of no customs deal being agreed before Brexit. Theresa May was forced to agree to a cut-off date of December 2021 for any interim arrangements after Brexit Secretary David Davis threatened to resign.But speaking to reporters on route to the G7 summit in Canada, she twice refused to give a ""cast-iron guarantee"" that the end date would not slip beyond that. And speaking in Brussels, the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier said the proposal could only apply to Northern Ireland, not the UK as a whole, and questioned whether temporary arrangements were acceptable, telling journalists ""backstop means backstop"".In the leaked comments, Mr Johnson said the prime minister was ""going to go into a phase where we are much more combative with Brussels"".He added: ""You've got to face the fact there may now be a meltdown. OK? I don't want anybody to panic during the meltdown. No panic. Pro bono publico, no bloody panic. It's going to be all right in the end.""Brexit will be ""irreversible"" and will happen, Mr Johnson said, but the ""risk is that it will not be the one we want"".He added: ""Unless you make the change, unless you have the guts to go for the independent policy, you're never going to get the economic benefits of Brexit. You'll never get the political benefits of Brexit.""He was said to have described concerns over the border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic as ""pure millennium bug stuff"" and suggested Chancellor Philip Hammond's department was ""basically the heart of Remain"".Speaking about the Treasury, he added: ""They don't want any disruption of the economy. So they're sacrificing all the medium and long-term gains out of fear of short-term disruption.""In response, Mr Hammond said his ""advice to colleagues"" was to engage with the EU as his experience was ""a collaborative approach is generally more productive than a confrontational approach"". But Brexit-supporting MPs backed Mr Johnson, Peter Bone saying Mrs May ""probably agrees with him as well"". The talks, he said, were ""being held back by Remain officials who are driving this thing"" - suggesting they should all be removed and Brexit Secretary David Davis given a ""free hand"". No 10 said there was ""rigorous debate"" about Brexit but its focus was on delivering the deal the public wanted. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said Mr Johnson was ""simply not fit for the high office he holds"" while Irish leader Leo Varadkar said ""when I want to know what the view of the British government is, I listen to the prime minister"". Labour MP Rupa Huq, who campaigns against a ""hard"" Brexit, said Mr Johnson had been ""very dismissive"" of the risks to Northern Ireland, treating it - in her words - as a ""small country that nobody bothers about"". Mr Johnson was the keynote speaker at Conservative Way Forward's summer reception and took questions for more than an hour, according to Buzzfeed.Asked about Donald Trump, he reportedly said he was ""increasingly admiring"" of the US President and was ""more and more convinced that there is method in his madness"". ""Imagine Trump doing Brexit,"" he added.""He'd go in bloody hard... There'd be all sorts of breakdowns, all sorts of chaos. Everyone would think he'd gone mad. But actually you might get somewhere. It's a very, very good thought."""

2018-06-09,Arron Banks refuses to appear before MPs,https://web.archive.org//web/20180609235544/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44413394,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowLeave.EU founder Arron Banks has accused MPs of a ""witch hunt"" against pro-Brexit groups after pulling out of a scheduled Commons hearing next week.Mr Banks had been due to give evidence to the Commons culture committee's inquiry into fake news on Tuesday.But he suggested it was biased as it had no Leave-voting MPs and had not called Remain groups for questioning.It follows a row over Vote Leave director Dominic Cummings' refusal to appear before the same committee.The Commons voted on Thursday to censure Mr Cummings and to require him to appear before 20 June.In a letter to Damian Collins, the Tory MP who chairs the committee, Mr Banks accused the committee of working with the Electoral Commission and Information Commissioner to target Leave-supporting groups.He suggested the committee had ""colluded"" with activist group Fair Vote Project, which has brought a legal action in the US against two firms controlled by Mr Banks, claiming they had improperly transferred personal data as part of a tie-up with the University of Mississippi. The case stems from the furore over the alleged harvesting of personal Facebook data by Cambridge Analytica and whether it was used to influence the outcome of the US presidential election and Brexit referendum.Mr Banks, who denies the allegations, said claims made by former Cambridge Analytica (CA) director Brittany Kaiser to the committee had been cited in the US lawsuit.Ms Kaiser told MPs in April that data misuse was ""rife"" among the Mr Banks-controlled Eldon Insurance and Big Data Dolphins firms, that Mr Banks asked Cambridge Analytica for a joint strategy for Eldon Insurance, Leave.EU and UKIP and that Cambridge Analytica ""took receipt"" of UKIP's membership data as part of this.Leave.EU rejects Ms Kaiser's statements and CA, which is being investigated by the Information Commissioner, said it has never received data from any Banks company.Mr Banks said the cross-party committee had ""actively supported"" the Fair Vote Project through the ""early release"" of written evidence from Ms Kaiser before her appearance.Mr Banks said he would be complaining to the parliamentary authorities and he and fellow Leave.EU director Andy Wigmore would not appear before the committee until the matter had been settled.""It is perfectly clear that the committee, which comprises only of Remain supporting MPs, is conducting a co-ordinated 'witch hunt' of Leave groups, involving the Electoral Commission and the Information Commissioner,"" he said. ""You have called no witnesses from the Remain campaign or associated groups.""In response, Mr Collins said that it was not just the committee that had questions for Mr Banks and that it would continue to ""follow the evidence"".And the Fair Vote Project said its US court action related solely to securing key documents and should not prevent Mr Banks from appearing before MPs. ""The court in Mississippi, the committee, the ICO and the Electoral Commission are all seeking answers to legitimate questions,"" said its director Kyle Taylor. ""We believe Mr Banks and Mr Wigmore can provide them.""Mr Banks has also said Leave.EU would appeal against a £70,000 fine from the Electoral Commission for breaches of election law in the Brexit referendum. The Electoral Commission said the group - which was separate from the official pro-Brexit group Vote Leave - failed to report ""at least"" £77,380 it spent. "

The government has rejected nearly all of the 15 amendments made by the House of Lords.It has accepted one amendment - on allowing EU law to be replicated in the UK - and is looking favourably at another,  by Lord Dubs on lone child refugees, but with changed wording.Speaking on her way to the G7 summit in Canada, Prime Minister Theresa May told reporters: ""I hope what everybody will see when they come to vote next week is the importance of ensuring that we get the EU Withdrawal Bill onto the statute book because it's that EU Withdrawal Bill that ensures that we're able to have that smooth transition when we leave the European Union.""But Labour said it was ""vital"" that Parliament had a meaningful vote on the Brexit deal. Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer said it was ""crucial"" the Lords amendment remained:"
2018-06-09,Trump isolated on first day of G7 summit,https://web.archive.org//web/20180609235544/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-44409775,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowDivisions between Donald Trump and other leaders of G7 nations were laid bare on the first day of their summit.The US leader made a surprise call for Russia to be readmitted to the group of top industrialised nations after its expulsion for annexing Crimea.But German Chancellor Angela Merkel said EU members attending the summit in Canada were all against the idea.Frictions over trade tariffs recently imposed by the Trump administration continued during Friday's session.After meeting French President Emmanuel Macron, Mr Trump said they had a little test once in a while when it came to trade but, he added, they were working it out.For his part, Mr Macron said he believed all sides were willing to find an agreement. Reuters news agency cited a French presidential aide as saying the US had agreed to start a trade dialogue with the EU at a technical level in the next two weeks.By the BBC's diplomatic correspondent, James RobbinsThis summit started very badly - and it could end without the usual communiqué agreed by all.Divisions between Mr Trump and the other six leaders go way beyond trade - they include climate change, relations with Iran and the Israel-Palestinian conflict.Mrs Merkel is one of those arguing it might be better to set out those differences clearly rather than give a false impression of unity. It's more honest, she said, than pretending everything's OK.Others still believe some sort of consensus can be found, and Mr Trump says he's hopeful of progress.But there's no doubt about Mr Trump's isolation. He dislikes negotiating with groups, and he will leave well before the end of this G7 summit: next stop Singapore, to face North Korea's Kim Jong-un, and seek the sort of one-to-one deal he much prefers.Mr Trump is leaving the two-day summit early to head to Singapore for his landmark summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.Canada had called Mr Trump's trade tariffs ""illegal"" while European Council President Donald Tusk warned that Mr Trump's stance on trade, climate change and Iran constituted a real danger.""What worries me most however is the fact that the rules-based international order is being challenged, quite surprisingly not by the usual suspects but by its main architect and guarantor: the US,"" he said.It is an annual summit bringing together Canada, the US, the UK, France, Italy, Japan and Germany, which represent more than 60% of global net worth between them.Economics tops the agenda, although the meetings now always branch off to cover major global issues.This time they are meeting in the town of La Malbaie in Quebec. Mr Trump said: ""You know, whether you like it or not - and it may not be politically correct - but we have a world to run and in the G7, which used to be the G8, they threw Russia out. They should let Russia come back in.""Initially, he found support in the shape of the newly installed Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, who tweeted that it was ""in the interests of everyone"" for Russia to be readmitted. The traditional ""family photo"" at #G72018 - but perhaps one that could do with a little family therapy. pic.twitter.com/fz9tcF7YgyEnd of Twitter post  by @stuartdhughesBut later Germany's Angela Merkel said all the EU members there, including Mr Conte, had agreed that Russia could not be readmitted unless there was ""progress"" on Ukraine. Canada too says it remains opposed.A Kremlin spokesperson meanwhile said they were interested in ""other formats"", apart from the G7.Russian President Vladimir Putin is currently in Beijing, where he was presented with a friendship medal by Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping.Fellow members of what was then the G8 suspended Russia after it took control of Crimea from Ukraine. Tensions remain, in part over the poisoning of a former Russian spy in the UK.Mr Trump's imposition of tariffs on steel and aluminium imports has sparked anger, with even US allies falling subject to them. The move has brought fears of a trade war.Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland called the tariffs ""illegal and absolutely unjustified"".Mr Trump said on Friday that the US and Canada were working on cutting tariffs ""and making it all very fair for both countries"". ""We've made a lot progress today,"" he said, adding that the relationship between the two countries ""is probably better than ever"". Looking forward to straightening out unfair Trade Deals with the G-7 countries. If it doesn’t happen, we come out even better!End of Twitter post  by @realDonaldTrumpUK Prime Minister Theresa May has said she wants the EU to act with restraint and proportion in retaliating to the US tariffs.The five themes for this year's summit are: According to the leaders' programme, Mr Trump will miss the talks on climate change, the environment and probably gender equality on Saturday.Pursuing the conversation. Engaging, keeping the dialogue alive, now & ever. Sharing, reaching out, always, to promote the interests of the French people, and all those who believe in a world we can build together. With President Donald Trump, prior to the opening of G7 Summit. pic.twitter.com/SD5hzLBO0XEnd of Twitter post  by @EmmanuelMacronThe US president was very much the odd man out on climate change during the G7 in Italy last year, later announcing his intention to withdraw from the landmark Paris agreement.Iran is also a big sticking point. Mr Trump recently ditched the 2015 agreement with Tehran that aimed to curb its nuclear programme. This angered the other signatories who have since sought to shore it up.Previous G7 meetings have seen huge protests, and about 8,000 soldiers and police officers are expected to be on hand during the Quebec event."

""Theresa May has so many nooses dangling around her neck that one of those nooses is sure to hang her."" He was talking about splits in the prime minister's cabinet, the need to keep Northern Ireland's unionist DUP on board, UK business demands, EU red lines and Brexit negotiating time running out.""It could be the UK unintentionally crashing out of the EU with no deal simply because time runs out."" Eurocrats also bemoan the fact that the UK government hasn't - in their opinion - been straight with voters, many of whom now have unrealistic expectations about the outcome of Brexit negotiations. Why isn't that true?Well, says the EU, the European Single Market was designed to create frictionless trade between its members and close associates, like Norway. To benefit, you have to be one of the gang and respect club rules and restrictions. Note: Once you are out of the club, a free trade agreement is far from frictionless and the EU is an unapologetically hard-nosed trade negotiator. Fondly referred to here as Brexit's square-peg, round-hole issueThe government has refused to accept a Northern Ireland-specific arrangement. Brussels says a UK-wide customs deal alone won't do it.   Read more here:In an effort to bring some clarity to the debate - and to dispel allegations made by some in the UK, including the government's own chief Brexit negotiator, that Brussels is being difficult in negotiations to punish Britain for leaving - EU figures have become very fond of going back to Brexit basics. The UK, they say, is free to choose the type of relationship it wants with the EU: staying in or leaving; remaining closely aligned or more at arm's length with the bloc after Brexit. As long, says Brussels, as the shape of that relationship complies with EU rules as well as UK wishes since it will be an agreement between the two parties. But, insists Brussels, where the UK has no choice if it wants an agreement with the EU, is when it comes to the Irish border. I welcome publication of #UK proposal on customs aspects of IE/NI backstop. We will examine it with 3 questions: is it a workable solution to avoid a hard border? Does it respect the integrity of the SM/CU? Is it an all-weather backstop?End of Twitter post  by @MichelBarnierBack in December, the UK and EU signed up to ensuring there would be no re-introduction of a hard border on the island of Ireland in order to safeguard the Good Friday accord. This is the reddest of red lines for the EU. All its normally fractious members are in agreement. And while the future relationship between the EU and UK remains foggy and undecided, Brussels is insisting on a time-unlimited, rock-solid backstop agreement to ensure that, as a last resort, and whatever else happens in Brexit talks, there will be no new hard border. And this is where there is further confusion at the moment - so hold on to your seat. The UK government is talking about a backstop agreement too, but it is referring to what customs arrangement could be put in place for the whole of the UK until a new post-Brexit customs deal is up and operational. This alone will not cut the mustard with the EU over Ireland. So - if and when the UK government finally reaches agreement on what it desires as the future EU-UK relationship - the warning from Brussels is this: pay attention to the Irish border; whatever else is agreed it could still bring the whole Brexit deal crashing down.

Who is behind it?Best for Britain aims to persuade MPs to back a referendum on the final Brexit deal secured by Theresa May when they vote on it in the autumn, with staying in the EU an option on the ballot paper.It would aim to persuade enough Leave voters to change their mind to vote to keep Britain in the EU - but the first stage of its campaign aims to generate pressure for another referendum.Its campaign slogan - already displayed on billboards in London, Birmingham, Manchester and Liverpool and in newspaper ads - is ""We all deserve a final say on the Brexit deal.""According to the Observer, Best for Britain will send a ""roadmap"" to MPs and peers, setting out how they could stop Brexit, when it launches its campaign on Friday. The group believes a referendum could be held in December, or possibly as late as February or March - when the UK is set to officially quit the EU - if Brussels agrees to it.It is targeting much of its campaigning muscle at the Labour Party's front bench, which is against another referendum - but it also needs at least 10 Conservative ""rebels"" on board in order to win a vote in Parliament on an amendment calling for a referendum.The campaign is also attempting to shore up support among Labour backbenchers sceptical about Brexit and is reportedly targeting 50 Leave-supporting Labour constituencies with billboard ads close to MPs' offices. The campaign will also lobby the big trade unions in an effort to exert pressure on the Labour leadership and is running a social-media campaign and a ""Labour Against Brexit"" speaking tour by leading Labour Remainers. It is also funding a grassroots campaign and has handed cash to local volunteers to ""help stop Brexit in your area"". Best for Britain was set up in April 2017, just before June's snap general election. Its initial aim was to encourage tactical voting to try to get more pro-Remain MPs into the House of Commons. The group said more than a million people had consulted its tactical voting website ahead of 8 June to find pro-Remain candidates.It reported spending £353,118 between June 2016 and June 2017, and made donations to pro-European candidates in marginal seats, including the Lib Dems' Tom Brake, Labour's Peter Kyle and Green MP Caroline Lucas. One of the group's founding members, Gina Miller, defeated the government over its power to trigger Article 50 without parliamentary consent, in the Supreme Court in January 2017. However, she stood down the day after the 2017 general election, saying the group had become too party political.Officially registered as UK-EU Open Policy Limited, Best for Britain is led by business and charity sector figures. This is in contrast to the MP-led People's Vote campaign - which is also pushing for a referendum on the final Brexit deal, although the two campaigns will join forces on 23 June to stage a march on Parliament.Best for Britain has £2.4m in its coffers and is asking donors for another £3.2m to realise its campaigning ambitions, according to its director of communications, Paul Butters, a former spokesman for Tim Farron, the ex-Liberal Democrat leader.The biggest individual donor is international financier George Soros, a Hungarian-born US citizen, who has given Best for Britain £800,000 in total so far, with £400,000 of that coming since the start of the year through his pro-European Open Society Foundation.Having made his billions in finance, including betting against sterling on Black Wednesday in 1992 - which gained him a reputation as the ""man who broke the Bank of England"" - Mr Soros, 87, donated more than £8bn to philanthropic causes between 1979 and 2011.UK electoral law bans foreign donations but only in the run-up to elections or referendums. Best for Britain says it has not taken money from overseas because the Soros donations came via his Open Society Foundations UK branch. The campaign is also keen to stress that it has also raised significant sums from more than 8,000 small donors.But the involvement of Mr Soros has generated a backlash in the Brexit-backing media, with the Daily Mail telling him on its front page: ""Butt out Mr Soros. You can keep your tainted money.""Mr Soros hit back at the Daily Mail's headline in an article for the Mail on Sunday, explaining why his love for Britain had led him to campaign against the ""tragic mistake"" of Brexit - and the campaign launched a Gofundme crowdfunding page entitled Help Best for Britain fight the Daily Mail, which has raised more than £64,000 in the past 12 days.Pro-Brexit campaign Leave Means Leave is, meanwhile, raising funds to combat Best for Britain, with its co-chairman John Longworth telling supporters in an email: ""We are determined to secure the swift, clean Brexit you all voted for.""Best for Britain is currently under investigation by the Electoral Commission, which oversees campaign spending, for submitting a return with invoices missing and for failing to return a donation of £25,000 from an impermissible donor within 30 days. It says it has complied with all relevant regulations.Lord Malloch-Brown, appointed 2 November 2017. A former foreign office minister, under Gordon Brown, who became a life peer in July 2007. Before that, he served as UN deputy secretary general, and from 1977 to 1979 he was a political correspondent at the pro-EU Economist, returning in 1983 for three years as founding editor of the Economist Development Report.The 64-year-old peer sparked controversy when he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme last month that Britain might as well stay in the EU, given the impossibility of divorcing itself from the Continent's problems. He said: ""Britain's history as an island nation adjacent to mainland Europe is when we try to, sort of, pull away from Europe's problems and close ourselves off to them, they have a horrible habit of infecting us anyway - appeasement in the 1930s, you name it. For centuries, Britain has ignored events on continental Europe at its peril.""Chief executive officer: Eloise Todd, 41. Until December 2016, Ms Todd worked in Brussels as global director of U2 singer Bono's anti-poverty charity, One. She had worked in the European Parliament for seven years after graduating from the College of Europe in Bruges.The Guardian has suggested that it was her personal connection to Best for Britain's biggest donor, George Soros, through the international development sector, that attracted him to the group, instead of better-known campaigns such as Open Britain, which is now part of the People's Vote group.Director: Sir Clive Cowdery, appointed 16 December 2016. The insurance businessman founded the Resolution Foundation think tank in 2005. He was chairman and chief executive of General Electric Insurance Holdings from 1998 to 2003. Knighted in the 2016 New Year Honours for services to children and social mobility, Sir Clive, 55, is worth an estimated £147m, according to the Sunday Times Rich List 2018, in which he ranked 804th in Britain. Director: Shakuntala Ghosh, appointed 3 March 2017. Chief executive of the charity Clore Social Leadership, which runs management training courses for charity workers, since April 2015, ""Shaks"" Ghosh, 61, led homelessness charity Crisis from 1997 to 2007. She has also held posts at the National Housing Federation and Centrepoint.Chief economist: Anatole Kaletsky, appointed 16 December 2016. Another former Economist journalist, Mr Kaletsky was appointed chairman of the Institute for New Economic Thinking in 2012, a foundation established after the 2008 financial crisis with $200m (£150m) of grants from, among others, George Soros. In 2010, he wrote Capitalism 4.0: The Birth of a New Economy in the Aftermath of Crisis.Director: Peter Norris, appointed 16 December 2016. Known as Sir Richard Branson's right-hand man, Mr Norris, 63, has been chairman of the Virgin Group since 2001. Sir Richard donated £25,000 and office space to the campaign in 2017 to help launch it. Before Virgin, Mr Norris was chief executive of Barings Bank when it collapsed in the Nick Leeson ""rogue trader"" scandal in 1995. He was temporarily banned from being a director by the Department of Trade and Industry in 1998.Director: Stephen Peel, appointed 19 October 2016. A former Goldman Sachs executive who represented Great Britain in rowing at the 1988 Seoul Olympics, Mr Peel, 52, has donated more than £75,000 to Best for Britain.Gina Miller: The businesswoman and philanthropist initially spearheaded Best for Britain, saying in her launch speech: ""Throughout the course of this general election campaign, we will be focusing on educating and empowering people to make a tactical vote and choosing MPs who will do the best for Britain. ""   But she stood down the day after the 2017 general election and has distanced herself from the group, saying it had become more focused on ""bringing down the Tories"" than Brexit.Alan Milburn: Chairman of the Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission from 2012 to 2017, the 60-year-old served in Tony Blair's government, as chief secretary to the Treasury from 1998 to 1999, then as secretary of state for health until 2003. He has been chancellor of Lancaster University since 2015. He resigned from Best of Britain on 3 March 2017.Sally Tallant: The director of the Liverpool Biennial festival of contemporary art, Sally Tallant, 50, resigned from the group in April 2017."
2018-06-09,Brexit: Key dates,https://web.archive.org//web/20180609235544/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44374613,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe countdown to Britain's planned departure from the EU is under way - here are the key dates and parliamentary battles on the road to Brexit.Ratification of the withdrawal agreement by the UK Parliament and the European Parliament. One of the key Brexit laws will return to the House of Commons this week. MPs will have to decide whether to accept or reject changes made to the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill by the House of Lords. Peers inflicted an unprecedented 15 defeats on the government in April and May on issues ranging from a customs union to environmental protection.There has been a lot of debate over whether Theresa May has enough Conservative colleagues onside to avoid damaging defeats on the Withdrawal Bill. But this is just one of the parliamentary hoops the government has to jump through before Brexit day. What is it?A law that will repeal the European Communities Act which brought the UK into the EU in 1972, and copy EU laws and regulations that are currently in force into UK law.It will also give ministers powers to make small changes to laws and regulations without having to bring a whole new bill to Parliament. This is one of the powers that opponents have feared could be open to abuse. When?The bill entered Parliament in July 2017 and has slowly made its way through both the House of Commons and Lords. After the government lost 15 votes on changes to the proposed bill in the Lords, MPs will now debate and vote on the changes. The bill will go back and forth between the two houses until there are no more changes being made, in a process known as ""ping-pong"".Potential flashpointsIf Mrs May's government fails to win enough votes in the Commons, the bill could be passed with some significant conditions attached. One of the most high-profile changes would require the government to report to Parliament on its effort to negotiate a customs union - something that has been ruled out by the PM.Please upgrade your browserWhat are they?In last year's Queen's Speech, the government announced eight Brexit laws that will be needed to prepare the country before it leaves the EU. Some of these have begun their journey through Parliament, but many of them are not even published yet, including a Fisheries Bill, Migration Bill and Agriculture Bill - all areas that will need significant new legislation once we are no longer under European jurisdiction. The two most high-profile are the Trade Bill and the Taxation (Cross-Border Trade) Bill, also known as the Customs Bill. When? Good question. The government has been criticised for its slow progress on key legislation. The Customs and Trade Bills have both passed the first stages in the House of Commons but no date is set for their return, perhaps because the next stage will involve crunch votes on the customs union that Mrs May could lose.Potential flashpointsWhen the Trade Bill returns to the Commons, MPs will vote on an amendment tabled by Conservative MP Anna Soubry. If passed, the amendment would force the government to make it an ""objective"" to take ""all necessary steps"" to set up a customs union between the UK and EU. This is much stronger wording than the amendment to the Withdrawal Bill and defeat would be a significant blow to Mrs May's plans.What is it?MPs will have a vote on the final withdrawal agreement and the framework for the future partnership once they've been negotiated with the EU. This is the ""meaningful vote"" promised to MPs by the prime minister. Brexit Secretary David Davis has said the vote will be on a motion that can be amended and that the government will treat the result as binding.When?Soon after the withdrawal agreement has been finalised (expected by the end of October 2018). Mr Davis has said the vote will take place before the European Parliament votes on the agreement. Potential flashpointsThis is potentially the biggest threat to the government's plans. Ministers have presented the vote as a decision between approving their withdrawal agreement and ""no deal"". If MPs can amend the motion, they could put conditions on the withdrawal agreement. The Lords added an amendment which would potentially give MPs even more power. Under that proposal they could direct the government on how it should act if the withdrawal agreement is rejected.What is it?Another bill that needs to be passed before the UK leaves the EU. It will enshrine the withdrawal agreement in law and give legal effect to whatever transition period is agreed. The difference between this and the motion in Parliament is that the motion is there to approve the withdrawal agreement while the bill is there to implement it. When?The bill cannot be written until there is a withdrawal agreement and it must be passed before Brexit day (29 March 2019). MPs complicated the process in December when they passed an amendment to the Withdrawal Bill - proposed by Conservative MP Dominic Grieve - that would require this bill to be passed before the government can use secondary legislation to implement Brexit. This means the vote on this bill will act as another ""meaningful vote"".Potential flashpointsIt is unclear what would happen if Parliament rejects the Withdrawal and Implementation Bill.What is it?Under the Withdrawal Bill, the government has the power to make changes to laws that need to happen before Brexit day. This is called secondary legislation and is often used to make small technical changes to laws. But opposition politicians have warned that excessive use of these powers could be undemocratic. When?The powers are contained in the Withdrawal Bill. But after MPs voted for Mr Grieve's amendment, ministers will not be allowed to use the powers until the Withdrawal and Implementation Bill has been passed.What is it?The final withdrawal agreement will have to be ratified as an international treaty. The government has to present international treaties to both houses of Parliament. If neither house raises objections, the treaty is passed and does not necessarily have to be debated or voted on. If there is an objection, ministers have 21 days to explain the merits of the treaty, before presenting it to Parliament again. This could technically be repeated multiple times.When?Mr Davis has said the treaty will have to be ratified before the withdrawal agreement can ""enter into force"".Potential flashpointsIt is unlikely that there would be a vote - or even a debate - on the treaty, seeing as the issues will have already been debated and voted on in the meaningful vote. Theoretically, Parliament could vote against the treaty, but it will not be able to amend it.The UK and EU have to agree on the terms of the UK's departure - as well as what sort of trading relationship they will have after Brexit. The UK is hoping an agreement can be reached on both of these elements at the EU summit in October.The government has promised a white paper setting out in detail what it wants from Brexit - but its publication has been delayed while wrangling goes on behind the scenes about what to put in it.There is expected to be a ""political declaration"" on the framework for future UK-EU relations after the October summit. MPs will then be given a vote on the withdrawal agreement before it goes to the European Parliament for ratification.But a number of sticking points remain - and all have to be resolved before the withdrawal agreement can be signed off and put to a vote. Here are the main issues that need to be sorted out (there are a lot of smaller ones too - you can read more about those here).This is the biggest sticking point.Both sides have committed to avoiding the return of a hard border, including physical infrastructure or related checks and controls, between Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.They want to achieve this by agreeing a comprehensive free trade deal with the continuation of open borders.But that could be difficult if the UK government sticks to its policy of leaving the EU single market and customs union.The UK government is working on two possible solutions - a ""customs partnership"", which would see the UK collecting tariffs on behalf of the EU, and ""maximum facilitation"", which would use new technology to track goods passing across the border.The EU has previously rejected both ideas.If all else fails, Brussels has proposed a ""backstop"" solution - which would see Northern Ireland stick to those rules of the customs union and single market that are required for cross-border co-operation to continue.But the UK government is against this idea, saying it would effectively separate Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK and create a border in the Irish Sea.Mrs May also wants an insurance policy to maintain an invisible border if trade talks break down. She is expected to set out details of her ""backstop"" proposal in due course, having seen her previous suggestion rejected by Brussels.The UK has set a lot of store by establishing a high level of co-operation on security issues, like counter-terrorism and the fight against organised crime, with the EU after Brexit. But there are significant disagreements about how this will work - and the EU's decision to exclude the UK from the Galileo satellite system on security grounds has poisoned the atmosphere, with the UK claiming it shows a lack of trust.The UK thinks that co-operation on extradition, the British relationship with the EU crime-fighting agency Europol and the sharing of criminal records should be the subject of a separate security treaty which the two sides should begin negotiating straight away.This is another issue that could bring the whole deal down, according to Michel Barnier.The UK is committed to pulling out of the European Court of Justice, the mechanism used to settle disputes between member states by interpreting and enforcing single market rules.The EU has proposed a joint committee made up of representatives appointed by London and Brussels. If they can't solve a problem, it would be referred to the European Court of Justice.The UK government likes the idea of a joint committee but not of the European Court of Justice having the final say.British companies hold all sorts of personal data belonging to EU citizens, and the European Commission thinks that European data protection laws should continue to apply to it after Brexit.The UK would like a comprehensive deal on data-sharing with the EU as part of the discussions about the future relationship, and is wary of agreeing divorce-related measures that could tie its hands.The EU wants the UK to share customs data for three years and information about certain taxes for five years after the end of the transition period.This is how the Brexit process is meant to go - but the UK or the EU could pull the plug on talks at any time. And, in theory, the UK and the other 27 EU members could agree to change the timetable or even halt the process Brexit altogether.As the European Commission likes to say, ""nothing is agreed until everything is agreed""."
2018-06-09,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20180609235544/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks have now moved on to future relations - after agreement was reached on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree within six months on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide, but first let's go back to the basics...It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.1% in the first three months of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.4%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand near a 40-year year low of 4.2%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 4.2% in the year to March 2018, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May is seeking to put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. If passed, it will end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, is supposed to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each playing roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanAn agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement wopuld only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.The full details are not yet known but UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72.We don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pounds buy fewer euros. A slump in the value of the dollar means the exchange rate with the pound is pretty close to where it was before the referendum.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.The UK has proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.A method for calculating the bill has been agreed, but the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more.The question of how and when payments will be made still needs to resolved, but it will be a schedule lasting for many years to come, and it is highly unlikely that anyone will ever be able to give an exact figure for the size of the divorce bill.UK sources say it will be up to £40bn, but some EU sources expect it to be higher than that. No-one can say for sure, and both sides want to keep it that way.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 6.5% in 2016 to 2.7% in 2017, according to the Halifax. It said the slowdown was driven by a squeeze on real wage growth.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-06-09,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180609235544/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to £840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"".

As I write, Mrs May is holed up with her advisers inside Tory HQ. But a former minister Anna Soubry has called for her to ""consider her position"" - political code for calling for her to resign. Read more from LauraJohn Curtice, Professor of Politics at the University of StrathclydeThis is the third post-war snap election called unexpectedly before a party's term of office had come to an end.  On the two previous occasions in 1970 and February 1974 the PM and the party lost office. While there is no other conceivable administration in the new parliament other than a Conservative-led one, it remains to be seen whether the PM will retain her position. However, so long as the Conservatives can reach an accommodation with the DUP they will have a working majority in the House of Commons.  BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed:When the general election exit poll was revealed at 10pm, the pound immediately dropped by 2% as investors took a position that a hung parliament was a possible outcome of the general election.Why would that cause the currency to decline? Because a hung parliament means that the government's direction of travel would be less certain.

In the joint article, the pair say the withdrawal bill is ""not about competing visions of the future but about ensuring legal certainty at our point of departure"".They called on colleagues ""to demonstrate discipline and unity of purpose"".""We cannot allow ourselves to become divided and risk losing the precious chance to go on implementing policies that transform lives.""If enough Tory MPs decide to vote with Labour and other opposition parties, the government could be defeated on several key votes.More than a dozen rebels could vote in favour of amendments intended to keep the UK in a customs union with the EU. Remaining in such an arrangement after Brexit is now Labour's position, so any Tory rebellion could spell defeat for the government.In the Telegraph piece, Ms Rudd and Mr Duncan Smith said Labour would be quick to exploit any government setback.""Jeremy Corbyn will do everything he can to stop us,"" they warned.""That includes cynically trying to frustrate the Brexit process for his own political ends.""Conversely, the government may be boosted by support from a handful of pro-Brexit Labour MPs.Please upgrade your browserWhile ministers are confident of winning most of the votes, the other amendment raising concern is the one which defines Parliament's role at the end of the Brexit negotiations.Appealing to those in the Tory Remain camp, the government says MPs will have plenty of opportunities in coming months to consider and vote on all aspects of Brexit, including any final deal that Mrs May negotiates. But Sunday's Telegraph article stresses: ""The disagreements in the party do not extend to whether we should leave, only how we do it"".Their comments echoed Mrs May herself, who, speaking at the G7 summit, accused lords of going ""far beyond"" their role with their amendments to the withdrawal bill.""Let's remember what the withdrawal bill is for: it's about delivering a statute book that is ready for Brexit day.""""This government is delivering on the decision made by the country in the referendum to leave the EU and we will not accept anything that prevents us from taking back control of our money, laws and borders."""

In his book, The Bad Boys of Brexit, Mr Banks had previously admitted to only one.The millionaire Brexit backer told the paper: ""I had two boozy lunches with the Russian ambassador and another cup of tea with him. Bite me. ""It's a convenient political witch-hunt, both over Brexit and Trump.""Mr Collins, chairman of the Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee, told BBC Sunday Politics it was ""big news"" and ""very relevant"".Mr Banks has agreed to appear before the committee.Mr Collins said there were ""important questions"", adding: ""We want to understand more to what extent Mr Banks profited from his relationship with the Russian embassy.The MP said: ""Did he make money out of it? Did he use that money to fund campaigns? ""If he didn't then that's fine but given the prominent role he played we've got the right to ask these questions.""The Sunday Times said Mr Banks and Leave.EU director of communications Andy Wigmore had also had lunch with the Russian ambassador in November 2016 - just three days after they and the former UKIP leader Nigel Farage had met Donald Trump in New York following his election victory.Mr Banks and Mr Wigmore also discussed potential business opportunities in Russia, emails reportedly show, including a proposal involving six gold mines.The scale of the pair's links to Russia is revealed in a series of 40,000 emails obtained by the former Sunday Times journalist Isabel Oakeshott, who ghost-wrote Mr Banks' Bad Boys of Brexit book.Ms Oakeshott passed them to the paper after her email accounts were ""hacked"". She suggested Mr Banks and Mr Wigmore were ""shamelessly used by the Russians"", but added nothing she had found ""invalidates the judgement of the 17.4m people"" who voted for Brexit. ""Had voters known about the links between Banks and Russia, I am certain they would still have made the same decision,"" Ms Oakeshott said.Mr Banks, who previously pulled out of a Commons inquiry into ""fake news"", said he would now be giving evidence, as planned, on Tuesday. ""We didn't profit from any business deals because I never pursued anything,"" he said.Meanwhile, Mr Wigmore denied handing over any Brexit-related information. ""We never offered any information to... any Russian any details of our campaign,"" he told the Sunday Times.In a tweet, Mr Wigmore went on to suggest the emails had been illegally obtained.When asked about the claims during a press conference at the G7 summit in Quebec, Prime Minister Theresa May said: ""I am sure that if there are any allegations that need investigation the proper authorities will do that.""The Russian embassy has said it has not intervened in UK domestic politics."

Processions began at 14:00 BST.By BBC correspondent Chi Chi IzunduThey are all here paying homage to the women of suffrage, but many of the thousands taking part want to make their voices heard now. ""Equal seats, equal voices"" was being chanted by one group of women demanding a 50/50 representation in parliament. Another group called out for equal rights for women in prisons. Women had travelled from as far as New Zealand to take part in the march, remembering how 100 years ago, their ancestors had travelled half-way across the world just to support the British fight for the right to vote. Men joined in too, reminding us that some did play a supportive role in the fight. Fathers accompanied their daughters, brothers walked alongside mums and sisters. And women from ethnic minorities wanted to highlight the plight that some had gone through supporting women 100 years ago.Girls as young as 12 marched alongside their mothers and grandmothers calling for equal pay and representation in all jobs and as a mark of respect for those who, 100 years ago, walked along parts of this very same route in the fight for women's voices to be heard.Tens of thousands of women were expected to join the processions, with women gathering from all over the world, and the events were broadcast on BBC One.Joanne Johnson said she was attending the march to ""honour the women that fought for our right to vote"".However she also said the fight for equality was still going on. ""The suffragettes started this but we still don't get equal pay, even in 2018,"" she added.Her daughter Rosie said she was there to ""say thank you to the suffragettes for what they did for us"".Let's all show up tomorrow in #Edinburgh #Belfast #Cardiff & #London for #PROCESSIONS2018, to honour all the amazing women who fought so hard for equal voting rights.

2018-06-10,May says G7 will act over 'malign' Russia,https://web.archive.org//web/20180611021757/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-44427668,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe G7 will take further action against Russia if it continues to interfere in other countries' internal affairs, Prime Minister Theresa May has said.Leaders were sending ""a clear message that such malign activity will never be tolerated"" after the poisoning of the Russia ex-spy Sergei Skripal, she said.Mrs May also said the EU would impose countermeasures after the US imposed tariffs on imported metal products.But the prime minister warned against a ""tit-for-tat"" response.Ahead of the summit in Quebec, US President Donald Trump had called for the G7 to re-admit Russia. But Mrs May said Russia needed to ""change their ways"" before being invited back into the group.Russia was expelled in 2014 in response to its annexation of Crimea. ""If there are to be any conversations about Russia's future in relation to this particular group, they have to change their ways, they have to change the route that they are taking and the sort of activity they are involved in,"" Mrs May said.Relations between the UK and Russia have been under immense strain since the Salisbury nerve agent attack on Mr Skripal and his daughter Yulia in March.Mrs May has been attempting to build an alliance against Russia while at the G7. In her speech, she welcomed the joint communiqué by world leaders, which criticised Russia's attempts to ""undermine democratic systems"".The communiqué also endorsed the UK's assessment that Russia was responsible for the nerve agent attack.During the gathering, the US president repeated his call for Vladimir Putin to join the other leaders around the summit table.""I think it would be an asset to have Russia back in,"" Mr Trump said.""I think it would be good for the world, I think it would be good for Russia, I think it would be good for the United States, I think it would be good for all the countries of the current G7,"" he said.""Where we disagree with our allies on something it is right that we say so and air the issue openly and frankly,"" said Mrs May, speaking at the close of the summit. ""We have done just that at this summit, registering our deep disappointment at the unjustified decision by the US to apply tariffs to EU steel and aluminium imports.""Earlier this month, the US imposed a 25% tariff on steel and 10% on aluminium imports from the EU, Canada, and Mexico, with Mr Trump saying tariffs were needed to reverse America's trade deficit.Mrs May said the EU would impose countermeasures, something Mr Trump has warned against.The EU has already announced tariffs on US goods ranging from Harley-Davidson motorcycles to bourbon. But the prime minister warned that we ""need to avoid continued tit-for-tat escalation"" and maintain a constructive dialogue.""There have been some difficult conversations and strong debates but by working together we have agreed an outline to shape a better future,"" Mrs May said."
2018-06-10,Firms to be forced to justify pay gap,https://web.archive.org//web/20180611021757/https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44417629,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe country's biggest public businesses may soon have to publish the gap between the pay of their chief executive and an average worker.Business Secretary Greg Clark says directors of all companies with more than 250 employees will be required to disclose and explain this difference - known as the ""pay ratio"".Equal pay campaigners, business and investor groups welcomed the plan.But the TUC said it was ""a first step"" and even tougher rules were needed.In recent years shareholders have become increasingly vocal over executive pay levels, and have voted against what they see as excessive pay awards, most notably the high sums paid to former WPP boss, Sir Martin Sorrell. But top level remuneration, particularly chief executives, is often linked to the performance of the share price. The new rules, as well as introducing the publication of pay ratios, will also require listed companies to show what effect an increase in share prices will have on executive pay, in order to inform shareholders when voting on long-term incentive plans. The plans, which will be presented to Parliament on Monday, follow concerns that some chief executives have been receiving salaries that are out of step with company performance.Mr Clark said: ""Most of the UK's largest companies get their business practices right, but we understand the anger of workers and shareholders when bosses' pay is out of step with company performance.""The plans were welcomed by the Investment Association - that represents UK investment managers - as well as business lobby group the CBI and think tank the High Pay Centre. Chris Cummings, chief executive of the Investment Association, said investors wanted greater director accountability and more transparency over executive remuneration.""Investors will expect boards to articulate why the ratio is right for the company and how directors are fulfilling their duties,"" he said.The director of the High Pay Centre, Luke Hildyard, said pay ratios could prove useful to investors, workers and society more broadly.""We hope that [the move] will initiate a more informed debate about what represents fair, proportionate pay for workers at all levels,"" he said.The Confederation of British Industry's Matthew Fell said high pay was only ever justified by outstanding performance: ""This legislation can help to develop a better dialogue between boards and employees about the goals and aspirations of their business, and how pay is determined to achieve this shared vision.""TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady called for guaranteed places for worker representatives on boardroom pay committees, saying they would bring ""common sense and fairness to decision-making when boardroom pay packets are approved"".If approved, the regulations will come into effect from the start of next year, meaning companies will start reporting their pay ratios in 2020."
2018-06-10,"Help space sector, Welsh ministers told",https://web.archive.org//web/20180611021757/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-44412845,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe Welsh Government ""just hasn't done anything"" in Wales' space sector, according to a UK space expert.Dr Bleddyn Bowen, from the University of Leicester, called space a serious sector ""we ignore at our peril"". He wants Welsh ministers to set up grants to stimulate research for innovation in the Welsh space sector.The Welsh Government said it was involved in academic centres of excellence supporting the development of businesses within the sector.Space technology can be used in space for exploration missions and on earth for unmanned aerospace and satellite technology for telecommunications, weather and environmental analysis. It is an area of policy reserved to Westminster but the Welsh Government can support Wales' space academia and industry, working with the UK Space Agency, which also coordinates British activity through the European Space Agency.According to 2014-15 UK Space Agency figures, space manufacturing in Wales generated £31m and employed nearly 200 people.It said there were 35 organisations in academia, industry and government involved in space-related activity.They include Aberystwyth University involvement in developing the Mars rover vehicle and the Beagle 2 mission, and Cardiff University work on a new European mission to study new planets.Llanbedr Airfield in Gwynedd - already used to test Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) - is one of four sites being considered for the UK's first commercial space port.But Dr Bowen, formerly of Aberystwyth University, told the Sunday Politics Wales programme the Welsh Government ""just hasn't done anything"" in the space sector.He said: ""Perhaps ... it's a capacity [issue], it hasn't got the resources to be interested, or perhaps the space sector is still relatively small in Wales, that nobody's thought about doing anything or nobody's actually made the case before to the Welsh Government, outside of industry as well.""And the fact that a lot of the activities happen on the UK and European level as well has sort of diminished anyone thinking that Welsh Government can or should do anything about it."" He wants Welsh ministers to use grants and loans to encourage innovation in the Welsh space industry and promote academic departments to develop commercial applications.""This is a high technology, knowledge economy-based solution for a lot of problems we have here on earth, that we can make money out of as well…something real, tangible, useful and functional that we can't do without in our modern economy. It's a serious sector of industry that we ignore at our peril,"" he said. A Wales Space Strategy was launched in 2015, written by the Welsh Government with the trade association Aerospace Wales Forum.The forum's chief executive John Whalley said progress had been slow but it had raised Wales' profile in the sector, with more investors lined up and announcements to come.He said: ""We are very much concentrating on the test and evaluation side in Wales because we have some wonderful facilities like the airfield at Llanbedr, the test range at Pendine, and Radnor Range right in the middle of Wales.""But there's also the whole down-stream side of space, which is the exploitation of data from space for things like satellite navigation, for broadcasting, for earth observation. ""We already have a number of players in Wales. I would expect to see the number blossom considerably."" Denying the inactivity charge, Welsh Economy Secretary Ken Skates said there were ""centres of excellence in Wales within our institutions, higher education institutions, and in further education, that support the development the companies and businesses within the space sector"".""And also the tech sector is crucially important to the activities involving space exploration, launching of satellites and so forth,"" he said.Some of the ""best companies in the world"" were in Wales, supported by the Welsh Government, and we should ""build on those areas of strength and make sure that we capitalise on UK Industrial Strategy's challenge funds as well"" Mr Skates said, confirming the Wales Space Strategy was being refreshed.""We reckon there are going to be huge opportunities working with the UK Space Agency, with Welsh institutions in education to make sure that we capitalise on what we've got within the space sector and within the tech industry sector at the moment so that we can leap to the forefront of space technological development,"" he said."
2018-06-10,Sturgeon pledges 'immediate' NHS pay rise,https://web.archive.org//web/20180611021757/https://www.bbc.com/news/44417739,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe majority of NHS Scotland staff will receive a 3% pay rise this year, Nicola Sturgeon has announced.She told the SNP conference that staff currently earning up to £80,000 will receive at least a 3% increase.And she pledged that the ""immediate"" pay rise ""will be in their pay packets next month"".She said the move meant the vast majority of frontline NHS Scotland staff will be paid more than in NHS England.It was confirmed on Friday that more than a million NHS workers in England will receive a three-year pay deal worth 6.5% after staff voted in favour of the offer. They will also get the money in their July pay packets, backdated from April.Ms Sturgeon also used her speech to contrast the ""shambolic"" UK government with her party's achievements at Holyrood.She repeated her call for immigration policy to be devolved to the Scottish Parliament. And she announced 750 new or refurbished nurseries to help deliver an increase in free pre-school provision, and more funding for students who have been in care.But she gave no details of when a second Scottish independence referendum could be held.Ms Sturgeon was speaking as the two-day conference in Aberdeen drew to a close.Ms Sturgeon told delegates that the past few years of pay restraint had been ""tough"" on NHS staff and other public service workers.She added: ""We're currently in negotiations to agree a three year pay deal for NHS staff in which we aim to not just match but exceed the deal agreed in England. I hope these talks reach a positive conclusion soon.""But I don't want those working so hard in the NHS to have to wait for that agreement to get a pay rise this year. So I can announce today that we will make a payment on account as negotiations continue.""Staff currently earning up to £80,000 will receive at least a 3% uplift, and those earning £80,000 and over will receive a flat rate increase of £1,600. Staff not at the top of their pay bands will also receive any incremental progression they are due.The announcement will benefit 147,000 Agenda for Change staff, such as nurses, midwives, allied health professionals, therapists, paramedics, support staff and administrators. Ms Sturgeon said the move would mean auxiliary nurses in Scotland with a year's experience in Band 4 would be over £800 a year better off than those in England, and nurses with five years' experience in Band 5 £400 better off.In her speech the first minister urged supporters to focus not just on the ""when"" of a second independence referendum, but also to ""use our energy and passion to persuade those who still ask 'why?'"".Ms Sturgeon did not directly address the potential timing of any referendum, having previously pledged to do so in the autumn when the implications of Brexit become clearer.The SNP conference has been a slightly subdued affair this year, with a heavy focus on the technicalities of the party's internal constitution rather than rhetoric about the national one. But Nicola Sturgeon's keynote speech can always be relied upon to get the faithful on their feet.There was a hefty dollop of ""day job"" material, from nurseries and tuition fees to a big announcement on NHS pay.But the memorable moments in the speech were red meat for the masses of the SNP membership - attacks on the ""shambles"" of a Westminster government and assurances that independence is closer than ever.Is it? In terms of timetabling for a referendum, no. The telling moment was when Ms Sturgeon urged her troops not to focus just on the 'when' of independence, but to work on winning people over to the 'why' of it, ""as we wait for the fog of Brexit to clear"".In terms of winning the argument, then? SNP members are heading off to a series of ""national assemblies"" to discuss the growth commission report on the economy. But their votes are in the bag already. The greater question is what the rest of the country makes of it.Ms Sturgeon praised her party's recent Growth Commission report, which she said ""doesn't shy away from challenges"" or ""pretend there are always easy answers"".And she said the document ""lays strong foundations"" for independence and ""offers a brighter future than Brexit and Westminster austerity"".The report was met with a mixed response from independence supporters when it was published a fortnight ago.It examines the economic options for an independent Scotland, and proposes keeping the pound and embarking on a major deficit reduction programme in the first years after leaving the UK.The first minister claimed that the ""shambolic Westminster Tory government is holding Scotland back, while the Scottish government is moving Scotland forwards"".And she highlighted the ""disastrous"" impact she believes the UK government's ""hostile migration policy"" is having on Scotland's public services and economy.Ms Sturgeon added: ""Scotland is a welcoming country - our prosperity and our public services depend on it.""If Westminster cannot or will not act in our best interests, it is time that our own parliament was able to do so. It's time for powers over migration to come to Scotland.""Pro-independence Catalan politician Clara Ponsati, who is fighting a legal battle against being extradited from Scotland to Spain, spoke directly before Ms Sturgeon. Prof Ponsati thanked her Scottish supporters Scots for their ""overwhelming"" backing in her fight, and told the conference: ""I am really overwhelmed by the affection and the support I have received since I put my feet back in Scottish territory.""What you are doing is showing your belief in democracy and human rights.

2018-06-10,UK to publish Brexit plans after EU summit,https://web.archive.org//web/20180611021757/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-44420045,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowDetailed plans on the UK's post-Brexit future will not be published until after this month's EU summit.Theresa May will summon senior ministers to an away day at Chequers in July to settle details of the white paper and find a common way forward.With ministers aiming to complete the negotiations by October, many expected the plans to be released earlier.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn accused the Tories of ""botching Brexit and risking jobs"".The announcement comes after Boris Johnson said the UK's Brexit strategy lacks ""guts"".The white paper has been called the government's ""most significant publication on the EU since the referendum"".Speaking at the G7 summit in Canada, the prime minister said: ""There's going to be a lot of activity in the negotiations over the coming weeks.One only has to look back at the turbulent week just passed to see the challenge Theresa May will face in uniting her bickering Cabinet at her away day.It took several meetings with the Brexit Secretary David Davies on Wednesday to quell suggestions he'd resign in frustration with the current status of proposals.Then a recording of the Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson emerged, undermining both the Prime Minister with claims the Brexit talks weren't going well, and also the pro-EU Chancellor Philip Hammond with a claim his Treasury Department was ""the heart of remain.""The latter was more than just a limp lettuce leaf based gag (hearts of Romaine/heart of remain - ouch!) - it underlined the serious divisions now being so publicly displayed between senior ministers that would normally be hidden behind the closed doors of the cabinet.Theresa May might hope taking them all away for a lock-in at Chequers will finally unite all factions behind a set of White Paper proposals - but this week suggests it won't be easy.""I'll be going to the June European Council where we'll be talking about finalising the withdrawal agreement, but also pressing on the future relationship. ""After that, I'll be bringing my ministers together for an away day at Chequers to finalise the white paper we're going to be publishing.""And then before Parliament breaks for the summer, we'll be bringing the Trade and Customs Bill back to the House of Commons. ""Throughout all of that time, the negotiations will be continuing.""Please upgrade your browserIn response, Mr Corbyn said that Parliament should take control and set negotiating priorities because the ""divided and chaotic government"" had failed.""The government promised a 'detailed, ambitious and precise' Brexit White Paper this month setting out their negotiating priorities. Once again it's been postponed,"" he said,""The Tories are botching Brexit and risking jobs and our economy in the process.""This week's events have once again highlighted the gulf of opinion in the cabinet over Brexit.On Thursday, Mrs May was forced to agree to an ""expected end date"" of December 2021 for any interim arrangements after Brexit Secretary David Davis threatened to resign over the wording of the UK's proposed temporary customs agreement - the so-called backstop.The proposal would see the UK match EU trade tariffs temporarily in order to avoid a hard Irish border post-Brexit.That row was followed by comments from the Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - recorded at a private dinner - where he warned of a Brexit meltdown, and said issues around the Irish border were mistakenly being allowed to dominate proceedings.Mr Johnson also branded the Treasury - and, by implication, Chancellor Philip Hammond, ""the heart of remain"".Responding to his comments, Mrs May said: ""The foreign secretary has strong views on Brexit, but so do I. That's why I'm getting on with delivering Brexit.""But on Friday EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier criticised Mrs May's proposals for a customs arrangement. He stressed that he was not rejecting the UK prime minister's ideas - but said any ""backstop"" to prevent a hard Irish border could not be time-limited.Mr Barnier said the UK paper ""raises more questions than it answers"" but would be examined ""objectively"".Mrs May told the BBC: ""This is a negotiation, Michel Barnier has said exactly that point.""We have put a proposal on the table, on this backstop relating to Northern Ireland, we will now sit down and negotiate it with the European Union."""

2018-06-10,Welsh Labour's Corbyn-style vote review,https://web.archive.org//web/20180611021757/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-44414448,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowWhether the next Welsh Labour leader is elected under the same system as Jeremy Corbyn is set to be decided at a special party conference.First Minister Carwyn Jones is set to step down in December after almost a decade at the helm of Welsh politics.But under the current electoral college system, his successor may win without a majority of votes from party members.Campaigners say bringing in the one-member-one-vote system - used to elect Mr Corbyn twice - would be fairer.Party bosses met on Saturday and decided to ask the former cabinet minister Lord Murphy to lead a review into the current voting system used in Wales.A special party conference will be held in September where a decision on whether to change the system is expected to be made. Mr Jones, who announced he would resign in a shock move in April, said there had to be a discussion about the voting system before the contest for who would replace him takes place.He said: ""It's a matter now for the party and its membership to decide how we move forward.""So far, Finance Secretary Mark Drakeford and Health Secretary Vaughan Gething have announced their intention to stand in the race to become the next first minister - but at the moment, only Prof Drakeford has enough nominations from AMs to run.Labour's UK leader election system was changed to one member one vote (OMOV), where all votes count equally, in 2015.But in Wales the leader is elected under the electoral college system, where the electorate is split into three sections - MPs and AMs, members, unions and affiliated groups - each delivering a third of the vote each.The campaign for the system to be changed intensified after Carolyn Harris MP won Welsh Labour's deputy leadership election, even though more members voted for her rival, Julie Morgan AM. Advocates of OMOV say the system is more democratic, but those who support the electoral college argue it reflects the links the party has with trade unions.Carwyn Jones had backed a decision by the party to keep the existing electoral college system after a consultation last year.But, in a paper considered by the Welsh Executive Committee when it met on Saturday, the first minister had proposed a ""democracy review"" of the party's structures.It will be split into two sections, with the first focusing purely on leadership election voting.Prof Drakeford is one of the numerous senior Welsh Government figures who support OMOV, but his rival Mr Gething has said he does not want to see the future system ""diminish the voice of the trade union movement, the Co-op Party and our other affiliates"".Debbie Wilcox, Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA) leader,  said she changed her mind on the matter following the deputy leadership election.""I saw during the process, how difficult it is now to explain to residents, to people in the streets, how someone got so many more votes, and actually, the person wasn't successful,"" she said.Unison and GMB called for AMs and MPs role in the electoral college to be reduced - or scrapped altogether.My understanding is that Carwyn Jones had initially hoped the review looking into whether the party should change its system of electing leaders wouldn't report back until after his successor was in place.In that regard he has clearly changed his mind, perhaps mindful of how the next leader could suffer in the face of opposition to how he or she got the top job.There seems to be widespread support that AMs and MPs should lose their special status and be counted as ordinary party members when it comes to voting for the leader.AMs, of course, decide who gets to stand in the first place.But breaking the connection with the unions, and their share of the electoral college vote, will not be so easy."

She said the process of leaving the EU was ""complex"" but her focus was on getting the right deal for Britain and people should judge her on her record in the negotiations so far. In a recording, obtained by Buzzfeed, Mr Johnson warns the UK could remain ""locked in orbit around the EU"" and claimed the Irish border issue - one of the main sticking points in talks with Brussels - had been allowed to dictate ""the whole of our agenda"".""It's so small and there are so few firms that actually use that border regularly, it's just beyond belief that we're allowing the tail to wag the dog in this way,"" he said.The foreign secretary was apparently speaking to around 20 people in a private room after an Institute of Directors reception on Wednesday night. It follows a day of wrangling over the government's ""backstop"" plan in the event of no customs deal being agreed before Brexit. Theresa May was forced to agree to a cut-off date of December 2021 for any interim arrangements after Brexit Secretary David Davis threatened to resign.But speaking to reporters on route to the G7 summit in Canada, she twice refused to give a ""cast-iron guarantee"" that the end date would not slip beyond that. And speaking in Brussels, the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier said the proposal could only apply to Northern Ireland, not the UK as a whole, and questioned whether temporary arrangements were acceptable, telling journalists ""backstop means backstop"".In the leaked comments, Mr Johnson said the prime minister was ""going to go into a phase where we are much more combative with Brussels"".He added: ""You've got to face the fact there may now be a meltdown. OK? I don't want anybody to panic during the meltdown. No panic. Pro bono publico, no bloody panic. It's going to be all right in the end.""Brexit will be ""irreversible"" and will happen, Mr Johnson said, but the ""risk is that it will not be the one we want"".He added: ""Unless you make the change, unless you have the guts to go for the independent policy, you're never going to get the economic benefits of Brexit. You'll never get the political benefits of Brexit.""He was said to have described concerns over the border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic as ""pure millennium bug stuff"" and suggested Chancellor Philip Hammond's department was ""basically the heart of Remain"".Speaking about the Treasury, he added: ""They don't want any disruption of the economy. So they're sacrificing all the medium and long-term gains out of fear of short-term disruption.""In response, Mr Hammond said his ""advice to colleagues"" was to engage with the EU as his experience was ""a collaborative approach is generally more productive than a confrontational approach"". But Brexit-supporting MPs backed Mr Johnson, Peter Bone saying Mrs May ""probably agrees with him as well"". The talks, he said, were ""being held back by Remain officials who are driving this thing"" - suggesting they should all be removed and Brexit Secretary David Davis given a ""free hand"". No 10 said there was ""rigorous debate"" about Brexit but its focus was on delivering the deal the public wanted. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said Mr Johnson was ""simply not fit for the high office he holds"" while Irish leader Leo Varadkar said ""when I want to know what the view of the British government is, I listen to the prime minister"". Labour MP Rupa Huq, who campaigns against a ""hard"" Brexit, said Mr Johnson had been ""very dismissive"" of the risks to Northern Ireland, treating it - in her words - as a ""small country that nobody bothers about"". Mr Johnson was the keynote speaker at Conservative Way Forward's summer reception and took questions for more than an hour, according to Buzzfeed.Asked about Donald Trump, he reportedly said he was ""increasingly admiring"" of the US President and was ""more and more convinced that there is method in his madness"". ""Imagine Trump doing Brexit,"" he added.""He'd go in bloody hard... There'd be all sorts of breakdowns, all sorts of chaos. Everyone would think he'd gone mad. But actually you might get somewhere. It's a very, very good thought."""

""Theresa May has so many nooses dangling around her neck that one of those nooses is sure to hang her."" He was talking about splits in the prime minister's cabinet, the need to keep Northern Ireland's unionist DUP on board, UK business demands, EU red lines and Brexit negotiating time running out.""It could be the UK unintentionally crashing out of the EU with no deal simply because time runs out."" Eurocrats also bemoan the fact that the UK government hasn't - in their opinion - been straight with voters, many of whom now have unrealistic expectations about the outcome of Brexit negotiations. Why isn't that true?Well, says the EU, the European Single Market was designed to create frictionless trade between its members and close associates, like Norway. To benefit, you have to be one of the gang and respect club rules and restrictions. Note: Once you are out of the club, a free trade agreement is far from frictionless and the EU is an unapologetically hard-nosed trade negotiator. Fondly referred to here as Brexit's square-peg, round-hole issueThe government has refused to accept a Northern Ireland-specific arrangement. Brussels says a UK-wide customs deal alone won't do it.   Read more here:In an effort to bring some clarity to the debate - and to dispel allegations made by some in the UK, including the government's own chief Brexit negotiator, that Brussels is being difficult in negotiations to punish Britain for leaving - EU figures have become very fond of going back to Brexit basics. The UK, they say, is free to choose the type of relationship it wants with the EU: staying in or leaving; remaining closely aligned or more at arm's length with the bloc after Brexit. As long, says Brussels, as the shape of that relationship complies with EU rules as well as UK wishes since it will be an agreement between the two parties. But, insists Brussels, where the UK has no choice if it wants an agreement with the EU, is when it comes to the Irish border. I welcome publication of #UK proposal on customs aspects of IE/NI backstop. We will examine it with 3 questions: is it a workable solution to avoid a hard border? Does it respect the integrity of the SM/CU? Is it an all-weather backstop?End of Twitter post  by @MichelBarnierBack in December, the UK and EU signed up to ensuring there would be no re-introduction of a hard border on the island of Ireland in order to safeguard the Good Friday accord. This is the reddest of red lines for the EU. All its normally fractious members are in agreement. And while the future relationship between the EU and UK remains foggy and undecided, Brussels is insisting on a time-unlimited, rock-solid backstop agreement to ensure that, as a last resort, and whatever else happens in Brexit talks, there will be no new hard border. And this is where there is further confusion at the moment - so hold on to your seat. The UK government is talking about a backstop agreement too, but it is referring to what customs arrangement could be put in place for the whole of the UK until a new post-Brexit customs deal is up and operational. This alone will not cut the mustard with the EU over Ireland. So - if and when the UK government finally reaches agreement on what it desires as the future EU-UK relationship - the warning from Brussels is this: pay attention to the Irish border; whatever else is agreed it could still bring the whole Brexit deal crashing down.

Who is behind it?Best for Britain aims to persuade MPs to back a referendum on the final Brexit deal secured by Theresa May when they vote on it in the autumn, with staying in the EU an option on the ballot paper.It would aim to persuade enough Leave voters to change their mind to vote to keep Britain in the EU - but the first stage of its campaign aims to generate pressure for another referendum.Its campaign slogan - already displayed on billboards in London, Birmingham, Manchester and Liverpool and in newspaper ads - is ""We all deserve a final say on the Brexit deal.""According to the Observer, Best for Britain will send a ""roadmap"" to MPs and peers, setting out how they could stop Brexit, when it launches its campaign on Friday. The group believes a referendum could be held in December, or possibly as late as February or March - when the UK is set to officially quit the EU - if Brussels agrees to it.It is targeting much of its campaigning muscle at the Labour Party's front bench, which is against another referendum - but it also needs at least 10 Conservative ""rebels"" on board in order to win a vote in Parliament on an amendment calling for a referendum.The campaign is also attempting to shore up support among Labour backbenchers sceptical about Brexit and is reportedly targeting 50 Leave-supporting Labour constituencies with billboard ads close to MPs' offices. The campaign will also lobby the big trade unions in an effort to exert pressure on the Labour leadership and is running a social-media campaign and a ""Labour Against Brexit"" speaking tour by leading Labour Remainers. It is also funding a grassroots campaign and has handed cash to local volunteers to ""help stop Brexit in your area"". Best for Britain was set up in April 2017, just before June's snap general election. Its initial aim was to encourage tactical voting to try to get more pro-Remain MPs into the House of Commons. The group said more than a million people had consulted its tactical voting website ahead of 8 June to find pro-Remain candidates.It reported spending £353,118 between June 2016 and June 2017, and made donations to pro-European candidates in marginal seats, including the Lib Dems' Tom Brake, Labour's Peter Kyle and Green MP Caroline Lucas. One of the group's founding members, Gina Miller, defeated the government over its power to trigger Article 50 without parliamentary consent, in the Supreme Court in January 2017. However, she stood down the day after the 2017 general election, saying the group had become too party political.Officially registered as UK-EU Open Policy Limited, Best for Britain is led by business and charity sector figures. This is in contrast to the MP-led People's Vote campaign - which is also pushing for a referendum on the final Brexit deal, although the two campaigns will join forces on 23 June to stage a march on Parliament.Best for Britain has £2.4m in its coffers and is asking donors for another £3.2m to realise its campaigning ambitions, according to its director of communications, Paul Butters, a former spokesman for Tim Farron, the ex-Liberal Democrat leader.The biggest individual donor is international financier George Soros, a Hungarian-born US citizen, who has given Best for Britain £800,000 in total so far, with £400,000 of that coming since the start of the year through his pro-European Open Society Foundation.Having made his billions in finance, including betting against sterling on Black Wednesday in 1992 - which gained him a reputation as the ""man who broke the Bank of England"" - Mr Soros, 87, donated more than £8bn to philanthropic causes between 1979 and 2011.UK electoral law bans foreign donations but only in the run-up to elections or referendums. Best for Britain says it has not taken money from overseas because the Soros donations came via his Open Society Foundations UK branch. The campaign is also keen to stress that it has also raised significant sums from more than 8,000 small donors.But the involvement of Mr Soros has generated a backlash in the Brexit-backing media, with the Daily Mail telling him on its front page: ""Butt out Mr Soros. You can keep your tainted money.""Mr Soros hit back at the Daily Mail's headline in an article for the Mail on Sunday, explaining why his love for Britain had led him to campaign against the ""tragic mistake"" of Brexit - and the campaign launched a Gofundme crowdfunding page entitled Help Best for Britain fight the Daily Mail, which has raised more than £64,000 in the past 12 days.Pro-Brexit campaign Leave Means Leave is, meanwhile, raising funds to combat Best for Britain, with its co-chairman John Longworth telling supporters in an email: ""We are determined to secure the swift, clean Brexit you all voted for.""Best for Britain is currently under investigation by the Electoral Commission, which oversees campaign spending, for submitting a return with invoices missing and for failing to return a donation of £25,000 from an impermissible donor within 30 days. It says it has complied with all relevant regulations.Lord Malloch-Brown, appointed 2 November 2017. A former foreign office minister, under Gordon Brown, who became a life peer in July 2007. Before that, he served as UN deputy secretary general, and from 1977 to 1979 he was a political correspondent at the pro-EU Economist, returning in 1983 for three years as founding editor of the Economist Development Report.The 64-year-old peer sparked controversy when he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme last month that Britain might as well stay in the EU, given the impossibility of divorcing itself from the Continent's problems. He said: ""Britain's history as an island nation adjacent to mainland Europe is when we try to, sort of, pull away from Europe's problems and close ourselves off to them, they have a horrible habit of infecting us anyway - appeasement in the 1930s, you name it. For centuries, Britain has ignored events on continental Europe at its peril.""Chief executive officer: Eloise Todd, 41. Until December 2016, Ms Todd worked in Brussels as global director of U2 singer Bono's anti-poverty charity, One. She had worked in the European Parliament for seven years after graduating from the College of Europe in Bruges.The Guardian has suggested that it was her personal connection to Best for Britain's biggest donor, George Soros, through the international development sector, that attracted him to the group, instead of better-known campaigns such as Open Britain, which is now part of the People's Vote group.Director: Sir Clive Cowdery, appointed 16 December 2016. The insurance businessman founded the Resolution Foundation think tank in 2005. He was chairman and chief executive of General Electric Insurance Holdings from 1998 to 2003. Knighted in the 2016 New Year Honours for services to children and social mobility, Sir Clive, 55, is worth an estimated £147m, according to the Sunday Times Rich List 2018, in which he ranked 804th in Britain. Director: Shakuntala Ghosh, appointed 3 March 2017. Chief executive of the charity Clore Social Leadership, which runs management training courses for charity workers, since April 2015, ""Shaks"" Ghosh, 61, led homelessness charity Crisis from 1997 to 2007. She has also held posts at the National Housing Federation and Centrepoint.Chief economist: Anatole Kaletsky, appointed 16 December 2016. Another former Economist journalist, Mr Kaletsky was appointed chairman of the Institute for New Economic Thinking in 2012, a foundation established after the 2008 financial crisis with $200m (£150m) of grants from, among others, George Soros. In 2010, he wrote Capitalism 4.0: The Birth of a New Economy in the Aftermath of Crisis.Director: Peter Norris, appointed 16 December 2016. Known as Sir Richard Branson's right-hand man, Mr Norris, 63, has been chairman of the Virgin Group since 2001. Sir Richard donated £25,000 and office space to the campaign in 2017 to help launch it. Before Virgin, Mr Norris was chief executive of Barings Bank when it collapsed in the Nick Leeson ""rogue trader"" scandal in 1995. He was temporarily banned from being a director by the Department of Trade and Industry in 1998.Director: Stephen Peel, appointed 19 October 2016. A former Goldman Sachs executive who represented Great Britain in rowing at the 1988 Seoul Olympics, Mr Peel, 52, has donated more than £75,000 to Best for Britain.Gina Miller: The businesswoman and philanthropist initially spearheaded Best for Britain, saying in her launch speech: ""Throughout the course of this general election campaign, we will be focusing on educating and empowering people to make a tactical vote and choosing MPs who will do the best for Britain. ""   But she stood down the day after the 2017 general election and has distanced herself from the group, saying it had become more focused on ""bringing down the Tories"" than Brexit.Alan Milburn: Chairman of the Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission from 2012 to 2017, the 60-year-old served in Tony Blair's government, as chief secretary to the Treasury from 1998 to 1999, then as secretary of state for health until 2003. He has been chancellor of Lancaster University since 2015. He resigned from Best of Britain on 3 March 2017.Sally Tallant: The director of the Liverpool Biennial festival of contemporary art, Sally Tallant, 50, resigned from the group in April 2017."
2018-06-10,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20180611021757/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks have now moved on to future relations - after agreement was reached on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree within six months on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide, but first let's go back to the basics...It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.1% in the first three months of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.4%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand near a 40-year year low of 4.2%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 4.2% in the year to March 2018, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May is seeking to put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. If passed, it will end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, is supposed to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each playing roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanAn agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement wopuld only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.The full details are not yet known but UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72.We don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pounds buy fewer euros. A slump in the value of the dollar means the exchange rate with the pound is pretty close to where it was before the referendum.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.The UK has proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.A method for calculating the bill has been agreed, but the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more.The question of how and when payments will be made still needs to resolved, but it will be a schedule lasting for many years to come, and it is highly unlikely that anyone will ever be able to give an exact figure for the size of the divorce bill.UK sources say it will be up to £40bn, but some EU sources expect it to be higher than that. No-one can say for sure, and both sides want to keep it that way.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 6.5% in 2016 to 2.7% in 2017, according to the Halifax. It said the slowdown was driven by a squeeze on real wage growth.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-06-10,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180611021757/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to £840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

On the two previous occasions in 1970 and February 1974 the PM and the party lost office. While there is no other conceivable administration in the new parliament other than a Conservative-led one, it remains to be seen whether the PM will retain her position. However, so long as the Conservatives can reach an accommodation with the DUP they will have a working majority in the House of Commons.  BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed:When the general election exit poll was revealed at 10pm, the pound immediately dropped by 2% as investors took a position that a hung parliament was a possible outcome of the general election.Why would that cause the currency to decline?

believed to include offering a new Parliamentary motion if the Brexit deal is voted down by MPs and peers - may have avoided defeat on the key demand for a ""meaningful vote"".Earlier, starting the Commons debate, Mr Davis told MPs the bill's ""primary purpose"" was to ensure a ""functioning statute book"" on the day the UK leaves the EU, 29 March 2019.The most tightly-contested amendment is likely to be the call for Parliament to decide what happens next if MPs decide they do not like the UK-EU Brexit deal.Mr Davis said this would represent a ""profound constitutional shift"" and that the government, not Parliament, should be in charge of international negotiations.Tory MP Sir Edward Leigh agreed, saying the change would amount to a ""wrecking of the will of the people"", and Sir Bill Cash said it was ""just a cover for a reversal of the decision"" to leave the EU.But pro-EU Conservative veteran Ken Clarke criticised ""real zealots"" who were trying to ""stop this Parliament playing any part in the process"".The government's offer to make a statement if the Brexit deal was not approved by MPs would amount to saying ""Oh House of Commons, get lost"", he claimed.Another likely Tory rebel, Anna Soubry, criticised some of her Conservative colleagues, saying their ""life's ambition"" was to take the UK ""over the cliff to the hard Brexit"".Ms Soubry also raised threats made to MPs over the issue, saying one of her colleagues needed six armed protection officers when attending a public event.As the debate continued, the government tried to convince potential rebels to back down, with Solicitor General Robert Buckland offering to hold talks with one of them, former attorney general Dominic Grieve, on Wednesday.Phillip Lee has been a junior justice minister since July 2016, having first been elected as the Bracknell MP in 2010.Explaining the reasons for his resignation, he cited the government's opposition to the ""meaningful vote"" amendment, saying this position ""breaches fundamental principles of human rights and Parliamentary sovereignty"".He also raised concerns about the economic impact of leaving the EU, saying Brexit had turned out to be much more complicated than first thought.The UK should ""pause, extend or revoke"" the Article 50 process which formally triggered its departure from the EU, he said, calling for another referendum once ministers' chosen path becomes clear.Pro-EU campaigners hailed his resignation as significant in their calls for a referendum on the UK and EU's final Brexit deal.Brexit-backing former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith said he was surprised, adding: ""I didn't realise he felt this strongly.""Mr Duncan Smith said the amendment giving more power to Parliament would be ""disastrous"" and allow the House of Lords to ""block the whole passage of Brexit"".BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the numbers were still ""rather dicey"" for the so-called meaningful vote amendment.It would mean ministers ""must follow any direction"" set by a House of Commons motion if Parliament rejects the final Brexit deal or negotiations run out of time.The government says this would bind the UK's hands in the negotiations.Speaking earlier on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Davis said a Parliamentary vote on the Brexit deal did not give ""the ability to reverse the decision of the referendum"".Asked what would happen if MPs rejected the deal, he said there would be no time to restart negotiations, with the UK leaving the EU in March 2019.""If they throw it out, well they throw it out,"" he said.Rebels have dismissed the government's amendment, a commitment by ministers to make a statement within 28 days should MPs vote down the package negotiated by Mrs May.A showdown over customs seems to have been averted after a compromise amendment was accepted by the government - which means it has agreed to report to Parliament by October on efforts to negotiate a ""customs arrangement"" with the EU after Brexit.The fallback position has won the backing of a cross-section of leading Tory MPs on either side of the Brexit argument, avoiding for now a showdown over calls - backed by the House of Lords earlier this year - for the UK to remain in a fully-fledged customs union with the EU after it leaves. Mr Davis said a ""great deal of progress"" had been made in negotiations, saying he was expecting both a withdrawal agreement and the ""substance"" of the UK and EU's future relationship to be finalised in October.He also described as ""nonsense"" reports he threatened to resign over the wording of last week's ""backstop"" plan to avoid border checks in Northern Ireland.The EU withdrawal bill is the legislation aimed at ensuring the UK has a smooth transition out of the EU, and will mean EU law is no longer supreme in the UK.To avoid a sudden ""cliff edge"" on Brexit day, 29 March 2019, it would also convert existing EU law into UK law so the government and Parliament can decide at a later date which bits they want to keep or change.The House of Lords has put forward 15 specific changes to the bill, but the government wants to kill off most of these changes.However, numbers in the House of Commons are finely balanced, with the Conservatives not having a majority and needing the help of Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party to get their way. On Monday, Mrs May told her MPs they ""must think about the message Parliament will send to the European Union this week"".""I am confident I can get a deal that allows us to strike our own trade deals while having a border with the EU which is as frictionless as possible,"" she said.""But if the Lords amendments are allowed to stand, that negotiating position will be undermined.""Please upgrade your browserLabour, which is backing 14 out of the 15 amendments, is urging Tory rebels to seize the chance to ""decisively shape the course of the negotiations"".Jeremy Corbyn's party is also divided on Brexit, with several MPs unhappy Labour is not backing a bid to keep the UK part of the EU's single market, like Norway.There is still a chance of a squeaky moment for the government, or having to rely on votes from some Labour MPs, on a move to give Parliament more power if MPs vote to reject the final Brexit deal.Sources tell me the numbers are still rather dicey for that so called ""meaningful vote"" amendment that will take place tomorrow. There are discussions ongoing among potential rebels about whether they should deploy their forces. Some of them believe, as they do on the customs issue, that they have the numbers to beat the government if they decide it's the right moment.

2018-06-11,Arron Banks to face MPs over Russia links,https://web.archive.org//web/20180612040812/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44446632,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowArron Banks, who helped fund the Leave.EU Brexit campaign, has told MPs there is ""no evidence"" he was involved in a conspiracy with Russian officials.And he accused the Commons media committee of being ""Remainers"" with a ""vested interested in trying to discredit the Leave campaign"".He met Russia's ambassador three times in 2015 and 2016, but insisted this did not mean there was a conspiracy.He was ""not an evil genius with a white cat controlling... western democracy"".Andy Wigmore, Leave,EU's communication director, was asked if the company had received any money from the Russian government. He replied: ""No. Nyet.""On Sunday, it emerged that Mr Banks had had two more meetings with the Russian ambassador Alexander Yakovenko than he had previously disclosed in his book on the referendum battle, The Bad Boys of Brexit.The last of these was in November 2016, three days after Mr Banks, Mr Wigmore and the former UKIP leader Nigel Farage met Mr Trump in New York following his presidential election victory.According to details of emails reported by the Sunday Times and the Observer, Mr Banks and Mr Wigmore also discussed potential business opportunities in Russia including a proposal involving six gold mines.Mr Banks attempted to laugh off suggestions of a conspiracy over his meetings with Mr Yakovenko, telling MPs: ""I was hoping for a good lunch and that is what I did gain from it.""He added: ""The only thing we gave in the second meeting was the telephone number of the (Trump) transition team because the Russians wanted to get hold of the transition team.""He said Leave.EU had ""briefed the American security services on everything that transpired"", as Mr Wigmore handed over a dossier of emails between Leave.EU officials and the US embassy in London and promised to hand over similar details about communications with the Russians.Mr Banks denied he was in Moscow in February 2016, as claimed by the Sunday Times, and produced passports containing Russian visas which he said proved he had been in Moscow twice in recent years, in March 2015 and October 2014.Mr Banks conceded that the story about that had probably come from his media spokesman Andy Wigmore, who said he liked to ""tease"" journalists by telling them Mr Banks was visiting the Russian capital.Mr Wigmore - who described his role in the Brexit campaign as an ""agent provocateur"" who had been ""making fun of people"" - was asked what the difference was between provocation and lies, He replied: ""If you are trying to sell something or put a good case over to somebody you will tell the best story. If that's provocation - or a lie, if you want to call it that, yeah.""Mr Banks chipped in to tell the committee: ""You seem to be quite humourless. But you are allowed to have a sense of humour.""Mr Wigmore said he had first sought a meeting with Russian officials at a UKIP conference in his role as a then diplomat for Belize, a small central American nation and former British colony.""His (Mr Banks') wife is also Russian. We thought it would be nice,"" he told MPs.Mr Wigmore said he was also ""trying to find investors"" for a banana farm in Belize which, because of its ownership, could not sell produce in the US or UK.""One of the conversations we had was about that. There was a myriad of things we wanted to talk to them about... it wasn't anything to do with politics,"" he told MPs.He said he had also discussed possible Russian investment in a Belizean port, owned by a bank belonging to former Conservative deputy-chairman and donor Lord Ashcroft, which had ""gone bankrupt"". Mr Wigmore said the meeting with Mr Trump had not been planned and only came about because the US President's adviser Kellyanne Conway had asked if they ""wanted to go and see the boss"" when they were in Trump Tower, in New York. He claimed he gave the Trump transition team the phone number of Number 10 Downing Street, because the team had ""no relationship"" with the British government.Mr Wigmore, who was Leave.EU's communications director, kicked off the session by calling on the committee's chairman to stand aside.He said Conservative MP Damian Collins should excuse himself from the evidence session because he accepted hospitality from ""Putin's number one man in the United Kingdom"" and might be ""conflicted"".Mr Collins recorded a trip to Chelsea Football Club, owned by Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich, on his register of member's interests.He called the suggestion a ""nice try"" adding ""you might have better intelligence than me... I didn't know that Roman Abramovich was Putin's number one man in London"".He said ""no inducements or offers, no shares in goldmines"" came out of his visit to Chelsea v Crystal Palace.""No honey traps?"" asked Mr Wigmore.""Chelsea won 2-1, that was the extent of the entertainment,"" said the committee chairman.Mr Banks then went on to attack the credibility of Brittany Kaiser and Chris Wylie, whistleblowers who had previously given evidence to the committee about controversial data firm Cambridge Analytica.He dismissed Cambridge Analytica as an ""advertising agency"" that ""did a little bit of politics on the side"".""We had two or three meetings with them and it became clear to me that - as is true in a lot of politics - there is a lot of sizzle and sometimes not a lot of substance,"" he said.Leave.EU, which was backed by Nigel Farage, lost out to Vote Leave in the battle to become the official Leave campaign and bad blood remains between Mr Banks and Vote Leave director Dominic Cummings, who has refused to be questioned by the committee.Mr Banks, who told the committee he ""despised"" Mr Cummings, was quizzed by MPs about Leave.EU's alleged use of ""fake news"" ahead of the 2016 EU referendum.""We were not above using alternative methods to punch home our message or lead people up the garden path if we had to,"" he told the MPs, adding that Parliament was the ""biggest source of fake news"".Mr Wigmore said ""the piece of advice that we got, right from the beginning, was remember referendums are not about facts, it's about emotion and you have got to tap into that emotion"".Mr Banks was questioned about his business interests and the source of his wealth, clashing with Labour MP Ian Austin who wanted to know more about his insurance company Southern Rock.Mr Austin said regulators in Gibraltar thought the company traded while ""technically insolvent"" for three years.Mr Banks denied the claim and accused Mr Lucas of using parliamentary privilege to make ""false statements"" which ""he knows will be reported elsewhere and that's why he's doing it"". He said no money from his overseas business interests formed part of his political donations and he was ""crystal clear"" about the rules.The insurance tycoon said he would not be involved in campaigning if there was another EU referendum, adding:  ""If I had my time again I probably wouldn't have done this in the first place.""Mr Banks - who was grilled by MPs for nearly three hours - refused to answer a final set of questions from Ian Austin, saying he had been promised the session would last 20 minutes and he had a lunch appointment to go to.Leave.EU was fined £70,000 by the Electoral Commission earlier this year for breaches of election law in the Brexit referendum. The watchdog said the group - which was separate from the official pro-Brexit group Vote Leave - failed to report ""at least"" £77,380 it spent. Mr Banks is appealing against the ruling."
2018-06-11,G7 summit was 'difficult' occasion - May,https://web.archive.org//web/20180612040812/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44444606,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe G7 summit was a ""difficult"" occasion, Theresa May has told MPs, with ""strong disagreements"" between the US president and other world leaders.While there was ""common ground"" in some areas, she said she was ""deeply disappointed"" by US trade policies.Pledging to uphold the rules-based order, she said disputes could not be solved by nations taking ""unilateral action against their partners"". Jeremy Corbyn said Donald Trump was to blame for the summit's ""failure"".The meeting of world leaders in Canada ended in disarray after the US President retracted his support for their agreed communiqué and then criticised Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau on social media.In a statement to MPs on the summit, Mrs May praised Mr Trudeau's ""skilful"" handling of proceedings and said the UK would honour all of the commitments agreed, on security, the environment and other issues. On trade, said she had been ""very clear"" that US tariffs on European steel and aluminium imports were damaging and dialogue was needed to ensure the dispute did not escalate into a full-blown trade war.She said US concerns that some countries were ""not playing by the rules"" when it came to international trade could not be ignored but they must be addressed multilaterally, for instance through reform of the World Trade Organisation.""It cannot be done by taking unilateral action against your partners,"" she said.She acknowledged the EU would have to respond to the tariffs with its own penalties on US imports but she hoped that it would not lead to wider ""tit-for-tat"" reprisals.By James Landale, BBC diplomatic correspondentTheresa May did not mention Donald Trump once during her seven minute summary of her weekend in Canada. But point by point, she challenged the US president's own conclusions. She told MPs of the importance of G7 summits: the shared effort to promote the rules-based international order, the need to make global trade work for everyone, the action to protect our oceans from plastics. Where Mr Trump had accused the Canadian Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, of being ""dishonest and weak"", Mrs May went out of her way to pay tribute to his leadership. And where the US president had withdrawn his support for the G7 communique, Mrs May pointedly made clear the UK would honour its commitments. Mrs May admitted that it had been a difficult summit - but said continued dialogue was the only way to resolve the challenges the world faced. It is an approach that may be tested next month when Mr Trump attends the Nato summit in Brussels before paying his first presidential visit to the United Kingdom.""The loss of trade through tariffs undermines competition, reduces productivity, reduces the incentive to innovate and, in the end, leaves everyone poorer.""More broadly, Mrs May said the UK would continue to promote the ""international rules-based order"" which she said had brought peace and prosperity to Europe for so many years. ""This was a difficult summit with at times some candid discussions but the conclusion I draw is that it is only through continued dialogue that we can find ways to work together to resolve challenges we face.""Mr Corbyn said the US President and his ""American First"" policy was squarely responsible for the breakdown in trade relations between the US and Europe. ""The problems facing leaders is that the White House is inhabited by a president committed to his slogan. ""That has meant the dismantling of multilateral agreements, the pulling out of the Paris climate change accords and the destabilisation of the Iran nuclear deal, and now the imposition of tariffs on steel and aluminium."""
2018-06-11,Scots opt-out organ donation bill tabled,https://web.archive.org//web/20180612040812/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-44438008,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowLegislation has been tabled at Holyrood to shift Scotland to an ""opt-out"" system for organ donation.At present, people must opt in to the system in order to donate their organs for transplants after they die.Under the proposals published at the Scottish Parliament, it will be assumed people were in favour of donation unless they have stated otherwise.Medics will still check with families to confirm the deceased person's views, and ensure they understand the process. Public Health Minister Aileen Campbell said the move was ""part of driving a long-term change in attitudes towards organ and tissue donation"".Currently, 45% of the Scottish population have signed up for the organ donor card scheme, although the number of donors has increased by 89% over the past decade.The Human Tissue (Authorisation) (Scotland) Bill follows similar legislation passed in Wales in 2015, and allows parts of an adult's body to be used in transplants in the absence of express permission.However, it includes provisions to make sure the wishes of families and next of kin continue to be respected, and excludes children and adults who do not have the capacity to understand the rules.Ms Campbell said: ""Organ and tissue donation is an incredible gift. Importantly, under the proposed system, people will still be able to make a choice about donation as they can now and there are safeguards to ensure their wishes are followed.""I would encourage people to continue to make a decision about donation and to tell their family.""Organ donation can only occur in tragic circumstances, and every donor, supported by their family, makes a selfless decision that can save other people's lives.""Less than 1% of people die in circumstances that enable organ donation to take place, as potential donors usually have to be in an intensive care unit at the time and there may be medical reasons that mean organs are unsuitable for transplantation.MSPs considered an opt-out system in the previous parliamentary term, but narrowly rejected a member's bill from Labour's Anne McTaggart due to ""serious concerns"" about the ""practical impact of the specific details"".Ministers promised to consider the idea, and have brought forward their own legislation with the backing of British Medical Association Scotland and 82% of respondents in a consultation.There have been calls for other parts of the UK to follow the Welsh model, and MPs have backed making a similar change in England.A study of the Welsh system found that it had not increased the number of donors across its first two years, although Health Secretary Vaughan Gething said it was ""too early to know the true impact"" of the change."

Mrs May said it was ""clear"" that the initial response to the disaster was ""not good enough"", adding: ""I include myself in that.""  She continued: ""What I did not do on that first visit was meet the residents and survivors who had escaped the blaze.""But the residents of Grenfell Tower needed to know that those in power recognised and understood their despair. ""And I will always regret that by not meeting them that day, it seemed as though I didn't care.""The public inquiry into the fire is currently paused for a week of memorials and vigils to mark the anniversary. In addition to the 71 victims who died in the blaze, Maria Del Pilar Burton, 74, died in January. She had been in hospital since she was rescued from the 19th floor.Members of the north Kensington community will come together for a 24-hour vigil on the eve of the anniversary.At 1:30 BST on Thursday, the names of the fire's victims will be read out at the nearby St Clement's church.At midday on the day of the anniversary, survivors and the bereaved will gather close to the tower's base to observe a minute's silence.In a show of solidarity, 12 tower blocks in the surrounding area will be illuminated in green.The buildings, plus Grenfell, will be lit up from 00:54 on Thursday - the time the fire is thought to have started - until 5:00. For the following four evenings they will be illuminated from dusk until midnight.The following day, schools across the country are expected to take part in ""Green for Grenfell"", a day to ""celebrate the spirit of people coming together""."

Under EU rules, bovine animals must be accompanied by a veterinary health certificate upon entry, detailing ""requirements in relation to BSE"".Mr Flack wrote to European Parliament President Antonio Tajani, and Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov to stop what he called ""a travesty of justice"".Penka was placed in quarantine and on Monday the Bulgarian Food Safety Authority said it had given her a clean bill of health and removed the death sentence.Mr Flack said: ""The original decision lacked all humanity and sensible judgment.

The National Institute for Economic and Social Research (NIESR) said growth between March and May was just 0.2%, The Office for National Statistics' official figures put growth at 0.1% for the first three months of the year.Amit Kara, head of macro-economic forecasting at NIESR, said that the economy continued to ""remain weak"".""Economic growth has slowed materially since the start of this year,"" Mr Kara said.""One reason for sluggish growth is the disruption caused by severe weather in March, particularly to the construction sector.""The latest data also shows a notable slowdown in manufacturing sector output that appears to be driven by both domestic and external conditions. By contrast, the retail sector and the dominant services sector may be recovering. ""Looking ahead, we expect the economy to strengthen from here mainly because monetary policy in the UK and elsewhere continue to remain accommodative.""The risks to that outlook are, however, weighed to the downside.""The most important of these remains Brexit but there are others, most notably an escalation of tensions in international trade and a potential flare-up in uncertainty in the Euro area because of political developments in Italy.""NIESR 's growth figure follows new statistics from the ONS which reveal that manufacturing and construction output fell between February and April, the former at its fastest rate since 2012, raising fears the economy was not just hit by the bad weather of February and March.""International demand continued to slow and the domestic market remained subdued,"" said Rob Kent-Smith, Head of National Accounts at the ONS.Oil and gas production did bounce back following the re-opening of the key Forties pipeline which was shut down by technical problems in February.The poor economic figures are likely to reduce the chances of an interest rate rise in August.The Bank of England suggested last month that gradual interest rate rises were ahead if the economy strengthened after the poor 0.1% growth of January to March.With that bounce-back now looking less likely, the chance of an imminent interest rate rise has receded and the pound weakened 0.3% in morning trading."

It follows reports a WPP inquiry into Sir Martin - once Britain's highest paid FTSE 100 chief executive - probed allegations involving a sex worker.Sir Martin strongly denies the claim, but the conclusions of the internal inquiry have not been published.Sir Vince said the secrecy was damaging the City and fostering wild rumours.""It is clear that WPP must publish the report into Sorrell's departure, if for no other reason than to stop any more rumours,"" said Sir Vince, a former business secretary.""Shareholders should not be kept in the dark. We're in danger of returning to the City's worst pre-financial crisis practices. WPP and Sorrell can help prevent a return to that damaging environment that by putting NDAs (non-disclosure agreements) and secrecy to one side."" His comments come ahead of WPP's annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday where questions are expected to be raised about Sir Martin's resignation in April.News earlier this year that the world's largest advertising company had called in lawyers to investigate alleged misconduct by Sir Martin sparked a flurry of speculation about use of company money and assets.Sir Martin resigned from WPP after 30 years at the helm, and has now set up a new advertising agency. WPP said the inquiry had concluded, but it could not release the details because of data protection issues.But over the weekend, it was alleged in the Wall Street Journal that the probe looked into whether he used company cash to pay for a sex worker. And on Monday, in a lengthy article, the Financial Times claimed that the internal probe was prompted because some staff took their concerns to the chairman, Roberto Quarta. Sir Martin's spokesman ""strenuously"" denied all claims of wrongdoing, but said there was ""a non-disclosure agreement when he stepped down which precludes him from discussing any of the circumstances surrounding his departure.""He has rigidly adhered to this obligation and will continue to do so. As regards the allegations which have appeared in the Wall Street Journal, Sir Martin strenuously denies them. He will be making no further comment at this time.""WPP says it cannot disclose the conclusions of its inquiry because of data privacy laws. The UK Information Commissioner's Office told the BBC that ""without the full facts"" it was impossible to say if this was the correct judgement.The lack of information is expected to be raised at Wednesday's annual meeting. Two shareholders advisory groups, Glass Lewis and Pirc, have criticised the lack of transparency, and urged investors to vote against resolutions at the meeting.Glass Lewis has said that without more information from WPP, shareholders were unable to determine whether Sir Martin was a ""good leaver"", adding that it had ""severe reservations"" about the firm's pay plans, given the lack of disclosure.Sir Martin is in line to receive £14m from WPP, having received £48.1m the year before. He will receive further payments over the next five years as part of his exit deal.Pirc noted in a report that under his contract, Sir Martin would ""not have been entitled to any further payment if he had engaged in conduct that constitutes wilful gross neglect or wilful gross misconduct""."

""I felt embarrassed, ashamed, I was very depressed and at some stages contemplated suicide.""But eventually he did get help and, with the support of Crisis, now has a home and a job working for a local council's housing advice and homelessness team.""It's been an absolute turnaround,"" he said.A recent report by Shelter, using existing government figures, found that more than 100,000 households in England had been on the waiting list for council housing for more than a decade.Responding to the Crisis report, the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said it was committed to tackling homelessness and rough sleeping.""We are investing more than £1.2bn to tackle all forms of homelessness,"" said a spokesman. The spokesman highlighted last week's announcement of £30m for councils ""to help boost support available to people living on the streets"".""We are also investing £9bn to build more affordable homes and are piloting the Housing First approach in three major regions to get people off the streets and into stable accommodation."""

""Theresa May has so many nooses dangling around her neck that one of those nooses is sure to hang her."" He was talking about splits in the prime minister's cabinet, the need to keep Northern Ireland's unionist DUP on board, UK business demands, EU red lines and Brexit negotiating time running out.""It could be the UK unintentionally crashing out of the EU with no deal simply because time runs out."" Eurocrats also bemoan the fact that the UK government hasn't - in their opinion - been straight with voters, many of whom now have unrealistic expectations about the outcome of Brexit negotiations. Why isn't that true?Well, says the EU, the European Single Market was designed to create frictionless trade between its members and close associates, like Norway. To benefit, you have to be one of the gang and respect club rules and restrictions. Note: Once you are out of the club, a free trade agreement is far from frictionless and the EU is an unapologetically hard-nosed trade negotiator. Fondly referred to here as Brexit's square-peg, round-hole issueThe government has refused to accept a Northern Ireland-specific arrangement. Brussels says a UK-wide customs deal alone won't do it.   Read more here:In an effort to bring some clarity to the debate - and to dispel allegations made by some in the UK, including the government's own chief Brexit negotiator, that Brussels is being difficult in negotiations to punish Britain for leaving - EU figures have become very fond of going back to Brexit basics. The UK, they say, is free to choose the type of relationship it wants with the EU: staying in or leaving; remaining closely aligned or more at arm's length with the bloc after Brexit. As long, says Brussels, as the shape of that relationship complies with EU rules as well as UK wishes since it will be an agreement between the two parties. But, insists Brussels, where the UK has no choice if it wants an agreement with the EU, is when it comes to the Irish border. Content is not availableBack in December, the UK and EU signed up to ensuring there would be no re-introduction of a hard border on the island of Ireland in order to safeguard the Good Friday accord. This is the reddest of red lines for the EU. All its normally fractious members are in agreement. And while the future relationship between the EU and UK remains foggy and undecided, Brussels is insisting on a time-unlimited, rock-solid backstop agreement to ensure that, as a last resort, and whatever else happens in Brexit talks, there will be no new hard border. And this is where there is further confusion at the moment - so hold on to your seat. The UK government is talking about a backstop agreement too, but it is referring to what customs arrangement could be put in place for the whole of the UK until a new post-Brexit customs deal is up and operational. This alone will not cut the mustard with the EU over Ireland. So - if and when the UK government finally reaches agreement on what it desires as the future EU-UK relationship - the warning from Brussels is this: pay attention to the Irish border; whatever else is agreed it could still bring the whole Brexit deal crashing down.

2018-06-11,Stop Brexit campaign,https://web.archive.org//web/20180612040812/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44331013,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowBest for Britain is this week launching a national campaign to stop Brexit. Who is behind it?Best for Britain aims to persuade MPs to back a referendum on the final Brexit deal secured by Theresa May when they vote on it in the autumn, with staying in the EU an option on the ballot paper.It would aim to persuade enough Leave voters to change their mind to vote to keep Britain in the EU - but the first stage of its campaign aims to generate pressure for another referendum.Its campaign slogan - already displayed on billboards in London, Birmingham, Manchester and Liverpool and in newspaper ads - is ""We all deserve a final say on the Brexit deal.""According to the Observer, Best for Britain will send a ""roadmap"" to MPs and peers, setting out how they could stop Brexit, when it launches its campaign on Friday. The group believes a referendum could be held in December, or possibly as late as February or March - when the UK is set to officially quit the EU - if Brussels agrees to it.It is targeting much of its campaigning muscle at the Labour Party's front bench, which is against another referendum - but it also needs at least 10 Conservative ""rebels"" on board in order to win a vote in Parliament on an amendment calling for a referendum.The campaign is also attempting to shore up support among Labour backbenchers sceptical about Brexit and is reportedly targeting 50 Leave-supporting Labour constituencies with billboard ads close to MPs' offices. The campaign will also lobby the big trade unions in an effort to exert pressure on the Labour leadership and is running a social-media campaign and a ""Labour Against Brexit"" speaking tour by leading Labour Remainers. It is also funding a grassroots campaign and has handed cash to local volunteers to ""help stop Brexit in your area"". Best for Britain was set up in April 2017, just before June's snap general election. Its initial aim was to encourage tactical voting to try to get more pro-Remain MPs into the House of Commons. The group said more than a million people had consulted its tactical voting website ahead of 8 June to find pro-Remain candidates.It reported spending £353,118 between June 2016 and June 2017, and made donations to pro-European candidates in marginal seats, including the Lib Dems' Tom Brake, Labour's Peter Kyle and Green MP Caroline Lucas. One of the group's founding members, Gina Miller, defeated the government over its power to trigger Article 50 without parliamentary consent, in the Supreme Court in January 2017. However, she stood down the day after the 2017 general election, saying the group had become too party political.Officially registered as UK-EU Open Policy Limited, Best for Britain is led by business and charity sector figures. This is in contrast to the MP-led People's Vote campaign - which is also pushing for a referendum on the final Brexit deal, although the two campaigns will join forces on 23 June to stage a march on Parliament.Best for Britain has £2.4m in its coffers and is asking donors for another £3.2m to realise its campaigning ambitions, according to its director of communications, Paul Butters, a former spokesman for Tim Farron, the ex-Liberal Democrat leader.The biggest individual donor is international financier George Soros, a Hungarian-born US citizen, who has given Best for Britain £800,000 in total so far, with £400,000 of that coming since the start of the year through his pro-European Open Society Foundation.Having made his billions in finance, including betting against sterling on Black Wednesday in 1992 - which gained him a reputation as the ""man who broke the Bank of England"" - Mr Soros, 87, donated more than £8bn to philanthropic causes between 1979 and 2011.UK electoral law bans foreign donations but only in the run-up to elections or referendums. Best for Britain says it has not taken money from overseas because the Soros donations came via his Open Society Foundations UK branch. The campaign is also keen to stress that it has also raised significant sums from more than 8,000 small donors.But the involvement of Mr Soros has generated a backlash in the Brexit-backing media, with the Daily Mail telling him on its front page: ""Butt out Mr Soros. You can keep your tainted money.""Mr Soros hit back at the Daily Mail's headline in an article for the Mail on Sunday, explaining why his love for Britain had led him to campaign against the ""tragic mistake"" of Brexit - and the campaign launched a Gofundme crowdfunding page entitled Help Best for Britain fight the Daily Mail, which has raised more than £64,000 in the past 12 days.Pro-Brexit campaign Leave Means Leave is, meanwhile, raising funds to combat Best for Britain, with its co-chairman John Longworth telling supporters in an email: ""We are determined to secure the swift, clean Brexit you all voted for.""Best for Britain is currently under investigation by the Electoral Commission, which oversees campaign spending, for submitting a return with invoices missing and for failing to return a donation of £25,000 from an impermissible donor within 30 days. It says it has complied with all relevant regulations.Lord Malloch-Brown, appointed 2 November 2017. A former foreign office minister, under Gordon Brown, who became a life peer in July 2007. Before that, he served as UN deputy secretary general, and from 1977 to 1979 he was a political correspondent at the pro-EU Economist, returning in 1983 for three years as founding editor of the Economist Development Report.The 64-year-old peer sparked controversy when he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme last month that Britain might as well stay in the EU, given the impossibility of divorcing itself from the Continent's problems. He said: ""Britain's history as an island nation adjacent to mainland Europe is when we try to, sort of, pull away from Europe's problems and close ourselves off to them, they have a horrible habit of infecting us anyway - appeasement in the 1930s, you name it. For centuries, Britain has ignored events on continental Europe at its peril.""Chief executive officer: Eloise Todd, 41. Until December 2016, Ms Todd worked in Brussels as global director of U2 singer Bono's anti-poverty charity, One. She had worked in the European Parliament for seven years after graduating from the College of Europe in Bruges.The Guardian has suggested that it was her personal connection to Best for Britain's biggest donor, George Soros, through the international development sector, that attracted him to the group, instead of better-known campaigns such as Open Britain, which is now part of the People's Vote group.Director: Sir Clive Cowdery, appointed 16 December 2016. The insurance businessman founded the Resolution Foundation think tank in 2005. He was chairman and chief executive of General Electric Insurance Holdings from 1998 to 2003. Knighted in the 2016 New Year Honours for services to children and social mobility, Sir Clive, 55, is worth an estimated £147m, according to the Sunday Times Rich List 2018, in which he ranked 804th in Britain. Director: Shakuntala Ghosh, appointed 3 March 2017. Chief executive of the charity Clore Social Leadership, which runs management training courses for charity workers, since April 2015, ""Shaks"" Ghosh, 61, led homelessness charity Crisis from 1997 to 2007. She has also held posts at the National Housing Federation and Centrepoint.Chief economist: Anatole Kaletsky, appointed 16 December 2016. Another former Economist journalist, Mr Kaletsky was appointed chairman of the Institute for New Economic Thinking in 2012, a foundation established after the 2008 financial crisis with $200m (£150m) of grants from, among others, George Soros. In 2010, he wrote Capitalism 4.0: The Birth of a New Economy in the Aftermath of Crisis.Director: Peter Norris, appointed 16 December 2016. Known as Sir Richard Branson's right-hand man, Mr Norris, 63, has been chairman of the Virgin Group since 2001. Sir Richard donated £25,000 and office space to the campaign in 2017 to help launch it. Before Virgin, Mr Norris was chief executive of Barings Bank when it collapsed in the Nick Leeson ""rogue trader"" scandal in 1995. He was temporarily banned from being a director by the Department of Trade and Industry in 1998.Director: Stephen Peel, appointed 19 October 2016. A former Goldman Sachs executive who represented Great Britain in rowing at the 1988 Seoul Olympics, Mr Peel, 52, has donated more than £75,000 to Best for Britain.Gina Miller: The businesswoman and philanthropist initially spearheaded Best for Britain, saying in her launch speech: ""Throughout the course of this general election campaign, we will be focusing on educating and empowering people to make a tactical vote and choosing MPs who will do the best for Britain. ""   But she stood down the day after the 2017 general election and has distanced herself from the group, saying it had become more focused on ""bringing down the Tories"" than Brexit.Alan Milburn: Chairman of the Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission from 2012 to 2017, the 60-year-old served in Tony Blair's government, as chief secretary to the Treasury from 1998 to 1999, then as secretary of state for health until 2003. He has been chancellor of Lancaster University since 2015. He resigned from Best of Britain on 3 March 2017.Sally Tallant: The director of the Liverpool Biennial festival of contemporary art, Sally Tallant, 50, resigned from the group in April 2017."
2018-06-11,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20180612040812/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks have now moved on to future relations - after agreement was reached on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree within six months on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide, but first let's go back to the basics...It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.1% in the first three months of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.4%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand near a 40-year year low of 4.2%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 4.2% in the year to March 2018, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May is seeking to put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. If passed, it will end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, is supposed to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each playing roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanAn agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement wopuld only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.The full details are not yet known but UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72.We don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pounds buy fewer euros. A slump in the value of the dollar means the exchange rate with the pound is pretty close to where it was before the referendum.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.The UK has proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.A method for calculating the bill has been agreed, but the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more.The question of how and when payments will be made still needs to resolved, but it will be a schedule lasting for many years to come, and it is highly unlikely that anyone will ever be able to give an exact figure for the size of the divorce bill.UK sources say it will be up to £40bn, but some EU sources expect it to be higher than that. No-one can say for sure, and both sides want to keep it that way.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 6.5% in 2016 to 2.7% in 2017, according to the Halifax. It said the slowdown was driven by a squeeze on real wage growth.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-06-11,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180612040812/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to £840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

On the two previous occasions in 1970 and February 1974 the PM and the party lost office. While there is no other conceivable administration in the new parliament other than a Conservative-led one, it remains to be seen whether the PM will retain her position.

2018-06-12,Ministers win Brexit vote after concession,https://web.archive.org//web/20180613011225/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44456035,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe government has avoided a major defeat on its Brexit bill by 324 votes to 298 after a late concession.Ministers saw off a move to give MPs the decisive say on what happens over Brexit if they do not agree with the deal negotiated by the UK government.Following a meeting with Theresa May, Tory MPs said they had been promised ""input"" into what the government would do if the UK faced a no-deal scenario.But one minister told the BBC he would only commit to ""further discussions"".Solicitor General Robert Buckland said the government remained ""open-minded"" but this may or may not result in it coming forward with new proposals in the coming days.The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said she had been told by a government source that no actual concessions have been agreed and the only agreement was to keep talking. Tuesday's Commons debate marked the start of the government's attempts to undo most of the changes to its EU Withdrawal Bill that were put forward by the House of Lords.The most contentious was the bid to give Parliament the power to tell the government what to do if the Brexit deal was voted down or no agreement was reached.There were clashes over how much of a say Parliament should get as the UK leaves the EU, with one side accusing the other of trying to ""wreck"" Brexit - and being accused in turn of being ""zealots"" who wanted to sideline Parliament.Seeking to placate would-be Conservative rebels, government frontbenchers offered to meet them to discuss their concerns, and agreed to ""engage positively"" on a ""compromise"" put forward by one of them, former attorney general Dominic Grieve.Details of precisely what this will involve will be agreed in the coming days when the bill is due to return to the House of Lords and ministers could table a fresh amendment. Analysis by BBC Parliamentary correspondent Mark D'ArcyThe government would not have sought a deal if it thought it had the votes to win, and they clearly blinked.The decision to seek a compromise marked an important victory for the soft Brexit/Remainer/""realist"" Tory rebels, who have been promised an amendment giving them most of what they want.Read Mark's full blogMr Grieve said he had ""confidence and trust"" in Theresa May to address the concerns of more than a dozen MPs who are reported to have held last-minute talks with the prime minister in her Commons office during the debate. Should the UK and EU not be able to agree a deal or if MPs rejected the deal on offer in the autumn, he said Parliament would have ""structured input"" from the end of November onwards into what happened next to try and avoid a crisis ahead of the UK's departure on 29 March 2019.Under the terms of his amendment, large parts of which have been accepted by ministers according to Tory MP Heidi Allen, the government would have to set out how it intended to proceed in a parliamentary motion that MPs could amend and vote on. Significant concessions from the PM on the meaningful vote amendment. Government agreed to integrate part A & B of Dominic Grieve’s amendment to the #EUWithdrawalBill with part C to be discussed asap. Will be tabled in Lords. On this basis, I abstained and await return to Commons pic.twitter.com/cX39Tr4bdhEnd of Twitter post  by @heidiallen75But the government is not believed to be willing to agree to Mr Grieve's call for MPs to take control of negotiations in the last resort if no deal is agreed by February 2019. In the end, only two Tory MPs - Ken Clarke and Anna Soubry - voted against the government.Jacob Rees-Mogg, chair of the influential European Research Group of MPs. told the BBC that a concession of this kind would have been ""revolutionary"" as the Commons cannot override the government when it came to negotiating international treaties.The leading Brexiteer said Mrs May had ""paid attention to both sides"" and the unity displayed by his party would strengthen the PM's hand in negotiations in the run-up to June's EU leaders' summit.Fellow Brexiteer Sir Bill Cash said he was pleased the Lords amendment, which he said would have given Parliament an effective veto over Brexit, had been ""soundly and significantly defeated"".Labour, five of whose MPs defied the leadership by voting with the government, said the prime minister may have avoided a ""humiliating defeat"" but the fight to ensure Parliament had a ""proper role"" in shaping the outcome of negotiations would continue. ""We will wait and see the details of this concession and will hold ministers to account to ensure it lives up to the promises they have made to Parliament,"" said the party's Brexit spokesman Sir Keir Starmer.Earlier, the government suffered its first ministerial resignation over Brexit as Phillip Lee quit the Ministry of Justice so he could speak out freely.Mr Lee said Parliament was being sidelined and called for another referendum to be held when the final direction of Brexit becomes clear.Revealing he had abstained in the Commons vote on Parliament's role, he said he was ""delighted"" at the government's concession, adding: ""This justifies my decision to resign and makes it a lot less painful.""The government, meanwhile, has reversed a series of other changes made by the Lords to the EU Withdrawal Bill, including reinstating the precise day of departure - 29 March 2019 - in the proposed legislation. A government amendment on the Irish border, guaranteeing there will be no new border arrangements without the agreement of the UK and Irish authorities, was also approved by MPs. "

And I cannot bring myself to vote for it in the bastion of liberty, freedom and human rights that is our Parliament.""Lee 'not trying to cause an avalanche' I'm told, this is about principle and long held concern about policy - awkward for May - he was part of her leadership team and near constituency neighbourEnd of Twitter post  by @bbclaurakHe added: ""When the government is able to set out an achievable, clearly defined path - one that has been properly considered, whose implications have been foreseen, and that is rooted in reality and evidence, not dreams and dogma - it should go to the people, once again, to seek their confirmation.""Opposition politicians and Remain campaigners welcomed his resignation.""For Theresa May, this is a warning of things to come,"" said Lib Dem Tom Brake.Labour MP Chuka Umunna said the Tory's backing for a second referendum was ""very significant"".Conservative MP Nick Boles said he disagreed with his colleague but admired his ""classy"" approach, contrasting it with ministers who ""threaten resignation but never follow through"".I don't agree with @DrPhillipLeeMP about the idea of holding a referendum on the Brexit deal. But I admire his honesty and integrity. So much classier to resign on principle when nobody is expecting it, than to threaten resignation but never follow through.End of Twitter post  by @NickBoles"

If that's provocation - or a lie, if you want to call it that, yeah.""Mr Banks used his appearance before the Commons media select committee to hit back at claims he was involved in a conspiracy with Russian officials, saying there was ""not one shred of evidence"" for it.He was ""not an evil genius with a white cat controlling... western democracy"", he told the committee, accusing its members of being ""Remainers"" with a ""vested interested in trying to discredit the Leave campaign"".He then went on to attack the credibility of Brittany Kaiser and Chris Wylie, whistleblowers who had previously given evidence to the committee about controversial data firm Cambridge Analytica.He dismissed Cambridge Analytica as an ""advertising agency"" that ""did a little bit of politics on the side"".""We had two or three meetings with them and it became clear to me that - as is true in a lot of politics - there is a lot of sizzle and sometimes not a lot of substance,"" he said.He also addressed revelations at the weekend that he had had two more meetings with the Russian ambassador Alexander Yakovenko than he had previously disclosed in his book on the referendum battle, The Bad Boys of Brexit.The last of these was in November 2016, three days after Mr Banks, Mr Wigmore and the former UKIP leader Nigel Farage met Mr Trump in New York following his presidential election victory.According to details of emails reported by the Sunday Times and the Observer, Mr Banks and Mr Wigmore also discussed potential business opportunities in Russia including a proposal involving six gold mines.Mr Banks attempted to laugh off suggestions of a conspiracy over his meetings with Mr Yakovenko, telling MPs: ""I was hoping for a good lunch and that is what I did gain from it.""He added: ""The only thing we gave in the second meeting was the telephone number of the (Trump) transition team because the Russians wanted to get hold of the transition team.""He said Leave.EU had ""briefed the American security services on everything that transpired"".Mr Banks denied he was in Moscow in February 2016, as claimed by the Sunday Times, and produced passports containing Russian visas which he said proved he had been in Moscow twice in recent years, in March 2015 and October 2014.Mr Wigmore said he had first sought a meeting with Russian officials at a UKIP conference in his role as a then diplomat for Belize, a small central American nation and former British colony.""His (Mr Banks') wife is also Russian. We thought it would be nice,"" he told MPs.Mr Wigmore said he had spoken to the ambassador about possible Russian investments in a banana farm in Belize and a port, owned by a bank belonging to former Conservative deputy-chairman and donor Lord Ashcroft. Mr Wigmore said the meeting with Mr Trump had not been planned and only came about because the US President's adviser Kellyanne Conway had asked if they ""wanted to go and see the boss"" when they were in Trump Tower, in New York. He claimed he gave the Trump transition team the phone number of Number 10 Downing Street, because the team had ""no relationship"" with the British government.Mr Banks - who was grilled by MPs for nearly three hours - refused to answer a final set of questions from Labour MP Ian Lucas, saying the session had overrun and he had a lunch appointment to go to.Mr Wigmore had kicked off the session by calling on Mr Collins to stand aside as chairman because he accepted hospitality from ""Putin's number one man in the United Kingdom"" and might be ""conflicted"".Mr Collins recorded a trip to Chelsea Football Club, owned by Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich, on his register of member's interests.He called the suggestion a ""nice try"" adding ""you might have better intelligence than me... I didn't know that Roman Abramovich was Putin's number one man in London"".In a statement after the hearing, Mr Collins said: ""Mr Banks and Mr Wigmore themselves put on the record that they frequently lie, exaggerate, misspeak and misunderstand.  ""So it is difficult for the Committee to know if we should take all of their answers seriously when it comes to data sharing and misuse, campaign spending, and their meetings with high ranking Russian officials.""He said his inquiry would be writing to the pair to follow up some of the points they had made, adding: ""Our inquiry is about getting to the truth of these matters."""

A DUP insider told the BBC's Nolan Show politicians are forced to pay as much as £1,000 if they break internal protocol on dealing with the press. The DUP said it operated under a constitution and a code of conduct, passed by its executive. The BBC has seen a letter signed by the DUP's chief executive imposing a fine on an elected representative. While the politician was asked to pay a £100 fine, the BBC understands repeat offenders might face higher charges of £500 or £1,000. The other main Stormont parties all told the BBC they do not impose similar penalties.The practice of fining elected representatives was ""quite unacceptable"", said the former chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, as it undermines democracy, and is authoritarian and draconian.""Elected representatives represent their constituents, even though they have been elected on a particular party ticket, they are there to put over their point of view representing those constituents,"" said Sir Alastair Graham.""If they are severely constrained through threats and fines, then that really does undermine their effectiveness,"" he added.The latest revelations emphasise the DUP's tight internal discipline. During the early years of the peace process, Ian Paisley's party chipped away at David Trimble's Ulster Unionists. The DUP was happy to see its rivals fracture into different camps, but determined to avoid the same fate.In 2007, as the DUP contemplated sharing power with Sinn Fein, the BBC reported that party candidates were being asked to sign post dated resignation letters and to pay big fines if they stepped out of line. The Ulster Unionists described the DUP rules as bordering on ""fascism"".  The signature on the letters imposing fines is that of Timothy Johnson. The DUP press officer - who declined to comment on the internal management of the party more than a decade ago - has now risen through the ranks to be the party's chief executive. The letters emphasise that all DUP ""these rules apply to all MPs/MLAs/councillors on political matters that are outside of their narrow constituency business"". Reporters working the Stormont beat will not be surprised at the sanctions facing individual DUP politicians, which explains some of the furtive nature of our interactions. But over in Westminster our colleagues, used to chatting with Conservative and Labour rebels as they decide whether or not to break ranks, may be surprised to hear that such a blatant system of fines is in place within the ranks of Theresa May's crucial  parliamentary allies.It said the party's chief executive, Timothy Johnston, writes to members when required ""from time to time"".But the DUP has not commented on its internal procedures.""The party reserves the right to decide what program to participate in, and the best mix of platforms to ensure communications with the people of Northern Ireland,"" it said in its statement. The allegation that the DUP impose fines came to light in an interview given by an anonymous party representative to the Nolan Show.""It was Timothy [Johnson] who sent me the letter,"" he said.""He emailed me and then he sent me a letter saying: 'You've spoke to the BBC (which I did) and we're fining you £100'. ""There's been lots of people fined. It's quite a frequent occurrence. ""The press office would report me to Timmy Johnson and Timmy Johnson then makes a decision whether or not to fine the person.""The representative said that Mr Johnson acted as ""God incarnate"" within the DUP, saying he was ""judge, jury, executioner, implementer, enforcer, advisor"".The representative also said that the DUP is officially boycotting the the Nolan Show due to its coverage of the RHI scandal and that the party tightly controls what MLAs are permitted to say during all media appearances.

2018-06-12,MP's murder was to be 'white jihad',https://web.archive.org//web/20180613011225/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-44452529,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAn alleged member of a banned neo Nazi group has admitted planning to murder a Labour MP in an act of what he termed ""white jihad"", a jury has heard.Jack Renshaw, 23, pleaded guilty at the Old Bailey to preparing an act of terrorism by buying a machete to kill West Lancashire MP Rosie Cooper.He also admitted making a threat to kill police officer Victoria Henderson.Renshaw, of Skelmersdale, Lancashire, is one of six men on trial who deny being in the group National Action.The other accused are: Christopher Lythgoe, 32, and Michal Trubini, 35, both from Warrington; Matthew Hankinson, 24, from Newton-le-Willows, Merseyside; Andrew Clarke, 33, from Prescot, Merseyside, and Garron Helm, 24, from Seaforth, Merseyside.Mr Lythgoe also denies encouragement to murder by allegedly giving Renshaw permission to kill Ms Cooper on behalf of the group.Renshaw had previously denied the two charges, but changed his pleas at the start of his trial.Prosecutors said Renshaw wanted to take hostages to lure Det Con Henderson to the scene so he could kill her too.But the court heard the plan was foiled after a disenchanted former member of National Action reported the threat to Hope Not Hate, an organisation seeking to combat extreme right-wing political racism.Prosecutors told the jury that National Action had supported the murder of MP Jo Cox in June 2016. Duncan Atkinson QC, said the defendants were ""not being prosecuted for their racist or neo-Nazi beliefs, however repulsive they may be, but for their participation in a banned organisation that sought actively through fear, intimidation and the threat of violence rather than through free speech and democracy to shape society"". He said Renshaw was preparing a ""politically and racially motivated murder"", and had sought the ""blessing"" of Mr Lythgoe.Mr Lythgoe, the prosecutor added, was effectively the national leader of National Action and ""nothing significant"" happened without his approval.He said National Action had engaged in a ""campaign of virulent anti-Semitic and homophobic propaganda"" since 2013.It was formally put on a government list of proscribed organisations in December 2016, but the defendants' active participation in the group did not stop with the ban, Mr Atkinson said.Jurors were told that Mr Lythgoe sent an email to others members just before the ban, saying: ""Long term we'll keep moving forward just as we have been"" - and the next day he wrote: ""We are just shedding one skin for another"".Mr Atkinson told the court that Robbie Mullen had been a member of National Action before the ban but became disillusioned with the group, particularly after the murder of Jo Cox.Jurors heard that, on 1 July last year, at a meeting attended by most of the defendants and Mr Mullen, Renshaw said that he planned to kill Rosie Cooper.The court heard Renshaw said he had already purchased a 19-inch (50 cm) long machete, and it was later found at his home.Mr Atkinson said Renshaw's ""objective was not simply to make a political point, as he put it to kill for National Action and white jihad, but to revenge himself on those he considered to be persecuting him"", namely Lancashire Police, and Det Con Henderson in particular. Renshaw told the meeting that after killing Ms Cooper, he would take hostages, and demand Det Con Henderson attend the scene, the prosecution claimed.""His plan then would be to kill that officer who was, he said, his real target,"" Mr Atkinson told jurors.""The court heard Renshaw had been arrested in January 2017 on suspicion of stirring up racial hatred over two anti-Semitic speeches he had given.He was interviewed by Det Con Henderson and another officer and then for a second time after analysis of a seized mobile phone ""revealed what the police considered to be evidence of child sex offences or grooming"".Renshaw had talked about how police were trying to destroy his life and make it sound like he was a paedophile, prosecutor said.He said after he had killed the officer he would commit ""suicide by cop"" by pretending to be wearing a suicide vest and would also make a video to say the attack had been done on behalf of National Action.Jurors were told Mr Mullen believed Renshaw was serious and there was an imminent threat to life, and reported what had been said to his contacts at Hope not Hate.Hope not Hate director Nick Lowles alerted the MP Ruth Smeeth -  who once worked at the charity - and she in turn warned Ms Cooper, leading to the police inquiry, Mr Atkinson said.The trial was adjourned until Wednesday."
2018-06-12,Wage growth slows despite unemployment fall,https://web.archive.org//web/20180613011225/https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44453071,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowWage growth unexpectedly slipped to 2.8% from 2.9% in the three months to April, despite unemployment falling by 38,000 to 1.42 million, official figures show.Economists had expected wage growth to remain steady at 2.9%.The slowdown is likely to dampen expectations of an interest rate rise in August. Wage growth is one of the key figures the Bank of England monitors to assess the health of the UK economy.Although it is above the current level of inflation of 2.4%, it remains well below inflation's five-year high of 3.1% seen in November. This consumer spending squeeze is one of the reasons many shops are currently struggling.Economists said the latest figures reduce the chances of a near-term increase in interest rates.HSBC's UK economist, Elizabeth Martins, said: ""The market is pricing in just a 4% chance of a rate rise at the Bank of England's 21 June meeting, so any change to policy would be a big surprise... at this point, the market sees around a 50% chance of an August hike.""The Bank of England, however, is expecting wage growth to pick up. Last month it said it expected to see pay growth of 2.75% a year by the end of 2018, rising to 3.5% by the end of 2020.Analysis by BBC economics editor Kamal AhmedWhy aren't wages rising more quickly?There could be many reasons. Since the financial crisis, lack of investment in new machinery and technology to help firms perform better punched a hole in economic performance.The public sector pay freeze followed by the 1% pay cap has also weighed on the overall numbers.Some economists also argue that a lack of bargaining power - union membership has been in long term decline - is leading to fewer widespread agreements on earnings increases.Read more from Kamal here""Employment has continued to rise, while the unemployment rate remained at its lowest for over 40 years. ""Wages, both including and excluding bonuses, are continuing to increase, and slightly faster than inflation,"" the ONS's statistician, David Freeman, said.The ONS also said the number of people in work reached a record high of 32.3 million.The ONS's latest figures received a mixed reception.The TUC's General Secretary, Frances O'Grady, said: ""Wage growth is stuck in the slow lane. At this rate pay packets won't recover to their pre-recession levels for years.""We need to speed things up. Extending collective bargaining would boost living standards and help workers get a fairer share of the wealth they create.""And the British Chambers of Commerce's head of economics, Suren Thiru also took a dimmer view.She said the slowdown in earnings growth was ""a concern"" and was likely to make a rate rise this year less likely: ""The slowdown in earnings growth, together with the recent weakness in a raft of other economic indicators, undermines the case for tightening monetary policy.""But Andrew Wishart, UK economist at Capital Economics, said: ""Another strong set of labour market figures in April suggests that firms remain positive about the outlook for demand despite the economy going through a soft patch at the start of the year."""

ADASS said it was desperately needed given the pressures on councils - local government has seen cuts in the amount of funding it gets from central government over the past decade.It surveyed all 152 councils in England.Three-quarters said they would be cutting the amount of care they provided, while nearly half said they would be introducing higher charges - people are expected to contribute to the cost of care where they can.It means more people are likely to be pushed into the private market.Currently only a fifth of those needing care get help from councils.The ADASS report showed that councils were also concerned about the impact on the care firms they pay to provide these services.Nearly one in three had seen home care services close or cease trading in the past six months, while slightly more had seen residential and nursing homes go under.The stresses and the strains faced by a care system under pressure usually play out quietly in the lives of people who are older and disabled - but the consequences can be no less devastating. If, as this survey of local authority directors of adult care suggests, councils end up supporting  fewer people, it will mean only those with the very highest needs get help.For many that will mean they have to reach a crisis, whether it is a fall which takes them to hospital or the illness of a husband and wife unable to cope any more with caring for their partner.  It is hard to underestimate the human cost of that. The government has acknowledged the pressures on the system and promised reform - something other governments have failed to do.Most experts agree the biggest challenge will be sorting out the money needed to pay for care - with the NHS also under pressure, the fear is that the less visible crisis in social care will be overlooked again.  ADASS president Glen Garrod said the findings were of ""serious concern"" and described the care market as ""fragile"".Caroline Abrahams, of Age UK, said it was a ""disgrace"" that there were people who were not getting the support they needed for daily essentials like ""getting dressed, going to the toilet, taking their medication or preparing their food"".""Unless policy makers are willing to invest in care, hundreds of thousands of older people face a bleak future, living without their needs being met,"" she added.A Department of Health and Social Care spokeswoman said plans would be set out soon to create a ""diverse, vibrant and stable market"".She also pointed out that extra money had been found in recent years to relieve some of the pressures, but conceded the system was ""under pressure""."
2018-06-12,Modern students 'prefer work to drugs',https://web.archive.org//web/20180613011225/https://www.bbc.com/news/education-44443349,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowStudents are more likely to want universities to take a tougher line against drugs on campus, rather than a more liberal response, say researchers.The study - from the Higher Education Policy Institute (Hepi) and the University of Buckingham - found 71% of students had not taken illegal drugs.But almost 40% thought their university had a ""problem"" with drug use.Hepi's director, Nick Hillman, said students were ""more hardworking and less hedonistic"" than was realised.The study, which surveyed more than a thousand undergraduate students, rejects the image of students being sympathetic to drug use, and suggests a more clean-living generation.It shows 62% wanting a ""stronger line"" from universities to stop the drugs trade on campus and 53% thinking that university authorities do not do enough to discourage drug use.Drugs did not seem to be prevalent enough to be a major worry - with more students concerned about excessive alcohol consumption than illegal drug use.The negative view of drugs saw them as causing mental health problems and encouraging criminality.Last week an annual study of student attitudes from Hepi gave further evidence of a cultural shift towards a more hard-working approaching to student life.It showed that students wanted to have more teaching hours, seeing a heavier workload as better value for money.Paying tuition fees and the pressure to get a good degree seem to have influenced what students expect from their years at university.Amy Watson, a first-year medicine student at the University of Southampton, thinks the previous generation was more likely to have taken drugs than current students.She thinks that the expectations of older people and media stereotypes of students have created a false perception.""My parents probably think more people take drugs than really do,"" says Amy.""People work a lot harder than I expected.""She says there is a ""stigma surrounding drug use"" and she would support the university taking a tougher line on targeting drug dealers.But despite the negativity towards illegal drugs, she says the misuse of alcohol is still common in universities.She also says the greatest stigma is now attached to smoking tobacco.Sam Carmichael, a 19-year-old student finishing her first year at the University of Buckingham, says the survey results reflect her own views.Students in her experience are a long way from any drugs culture.She would prefer universities to ""crack down"" on drugs, rather than adopt a more tolerant approach.But she says that there is still a persistent media image of students as drug takers.""It's less than people think. It's not true,"" she says.She would prefer universities to make particular efforts to stop drug dealing.""It makes us feel less safe,"" she says.But she also thinks there should be better ""monitoring"" of students who drink too much alcohol and ""get off their faces"".The results from this survey do not agree with another recent piece of research from the National Union of Students, which suggested that about two in five students were drug users.Cannabis, ecstasy, nitrous oxide and cocaine were the most widely used, according to a study which suggested that drugs were much more pervasive than claimed by the Hepi and University of Buckingham report.The NUS says the approach of taking a tougher line on drug use could be counter-productive.""Punitive approaches and taking a tougher stance on drugs can discourage people from seeking the help they need,"" said NUS officer, Jess Bradley.The differences in findings suggest how different individual experiences and peer groups can be.But Mr Hillman says the ""survey provides an important corrective to some of the wilder ideas about today's students"".Sir Anthony Seldon, vice chancellor of the University of Buckingham, says: ""With illegal drugs, we have been fiddling while Rome burns. ""Illegal drug-taking causes mental health problems, and is a symptom of them. Even students themselves think there needs to be a stronger lead on drug dealing."""
2018-06-12,G7 summit was 'difficult' occasion - May,https://web.archive.org//web/20180613011225/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44444606,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe G7 summit was a ""difficult"" occasion, Theresa May has told MPs, with ""strong disagreements"" between the US president and other world leaders.While there was ""common ground"" in some areas, she said she was ""deeply disappointed"" by US trade policies.Pledging to uphold the rules-based order, she said disputes could not be solved by nations taking ""unilateral action against their partners"". Jeremy Corbyn said Donald Trump was to blame for the summit's ""failure"".The meeting of world leaders in Canada ended in disarray after the US President retracted his support for their agreed communiqué and then criticised Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau on social media.In a statement to MPs on the summit, Mrs May praised Mr Trudeau's ""skilful"" handling of proceedings and said the UK would honour all of the commitments agreed, on security, the environment and other issues. On trade, said she had been ""very clear"" that US tariffs on European steel and aluminium imports were damaging and dialogue was needed to ensure the dispute did not escalate into a full-blown trade war.She said US concerns that some countries were ""not playing by the rules"" when it came to international trade could not be ignored but they must be addressed multilaterally, for instance through reform of the World Trade Organisation.""It cannot be done by taking unilateral action against your partners,"" she said.She acknowledged the EU would have to respond to the tariffs with its own penalties on US imports but she hoped that it would not lead to wider ""tit-for-tat"" reprisals.By James Landale, BBC diplomatic correspondentTheresa May did not mention Donald Trump once during her seven minute summary of her weekend in Canada. But point by point, she challenged the US president's own conclusions. She told MPs of the importance of G7 summits: the shared effort to promote the rules-based international order, the need to make global trade work for everyone, the action to protect our oceans from plastics. Where Mr Trump had accused the Canadian Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, of being ""dishonest and weak"", Mrs May went out of her way to pay tribute to his leadership. And where the US president had withdrawn his support for the G7 communique, Mrs May pointedly made clear the UK would honour its commitments. Mrs May admitted that it had been a difficult summit - but said continued dialogue was the only way to resolve the challenges the world faced. It is an approach that may be tested next month when Mr Trump attends the Nato summit in Brussels before paying his first presidential visit to the United Kingdom.""The loss of trade through tariffs undermines competition, reduces productivity, reduces the incentive to innovate and, in the end, leaves everyone poorer.""More broadly, Mrs May said the UK would continue to promote the ""international rules-based order"" which she said had brought peace and prosperity to Europe for so many years. ""This was a difficult summit with at times some candid discussions but the conclusion I draw is that it is only through continued dialogue that we can find ways to work together to resolve challenges we face.""Mr Corbyn said the US President and his ""American First"" policy was squarely responsible for the breakdown in trade relations between the US and Europe. ""The problems facing leaders is that the White House is inhabited by a president committed to his slogan. ""That has meant the dismantling of multilateral agreements, the pulling out of the Paris climate change accords and the destabilisation of the Iran nuclear deal, and now the imposition of tariffs on steel and aluminium."""
2018-06-12,Scots opt-out organ donation bill tabled,https://web.archive.org//web/20180613011225/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-44438008,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowLegislation has been tabled at Holyrood to shift Scotland to an ""opt-out"" system for organ donation.At present, people must opt in to the system in order to donate their organs for transplants after they die.Under the proposals published at the Scottish Parliament, it will be assumed people were in favour of donation unless they have stated otherwise.Medics will still check with families to confirm the deceased person's views, and ensure they understand the process. Public Health Minister Aileen Campbell said the move was ""part of driving a long-term change in attitudes towards organ and tissue donation"".Currently, 45% of the Scottish population have signed up for the organ donor card scheme, although the number of donors has increased by 89% over the past decade.The Human Tissue (Authorisation) (Scotland) Bill follows similar legislation passed in Wales in 2015, and allows parts of an adult's body to be used in transplants in the absence of express permission.However, it includes provisions to make sure the wishes of families and next of kin continue to be respected, and excludes children and adults who do not have the capacity to understand the rules.Ms Campbell said: ""Organ and tissue donation is an incredible gift. Importantly, under the proposed system, people will still be able to make a choice about donation as they can now and there are safeguards to ensure their wishes are followed.""I would encourage people to continue to make a decision about donation and to tell their family.""Organ donation can only occur in tragic circumstances, and every donor, supported by their family, makes a selfless decision that can save other people's lives.""Less than 1% of people die in circumstances that enable organ donation to take place, as potential donors usually have to be in an intensive care unit at the time and there may be medical reasons that mean organs are unsuitable for transplantation.MSPs considered an opt-out system in the previous parliamentary term, but narrowly rejected a member's bill from Labour's Anne McTaggart due to ""serious concerns"" about the ""practical impact of the specific details"".Ministers promised to consider the idea, and have brought forward their own legislation with the backing of British Medical Association Scotland and 82% of respondents in a consultation.There have been calls for other parts of the UK to follow the Welsh model, and MPs have backed making a similar change in England.A study of the Welsh system found that it had not increased the number of donors across its first two years, although Health Secretary Vaughan Gething said it was ""too early to know the true impact"" of the change."

""Theresa May has so many nooses dangling around her neck that one of those nooses is sure to hang her."" He was talking about splits in the prime minister's cabinet, the need to keep Northern Ireland's unionist DUP on board, UK business demands, EU red lines and Brexit negotiating time running out.""It could be the UK unintentionally crashing out of the EU with no deal simply because time runs out."" Eurocrats also bemoan the fact that the UK government hasn't - in their opinion - been straight with voters, many of whom now have unrealistic expectations about the outcome of Brexit negotiations. Why isn't that true?Well, says the EU, the European Single Market was designed to create frictionless trade between its members and close associates, like Norway. To benefit, you have to be one of the gang and respect club rules and restrictions. Note: Once you are out of the club, a free trade agreement is far from frictionless and the EU is an unapologetically hard-nosed trade negotiator. Fondly referred to here as Brexit's square-peg, round-hole issueThe government has refused to accept a Northern Ireland-specific arrangement. Brussels says a UK-wide customs deal alone won't do it.   Read more here:In an effort to bring some clarity to the debate - and to dispel allegations made by some in the UK, including the government's own chief Brexit negotiator, that Brussels is being difficult in negotiations to punish Britain for leaving - EU figures have become very fond of going back to Brexit basics. The UK, they say, is free to choose the type of relationship it wants with the EU: staying in or leaving; remaining closely aligned or more at arm's length with the bloc after Brexit. As long, says Brussels, as the shape of that relationship complies with EU rules as well as UK wishes since it will be an agreement between the two parties. But, insists Brussels, where the UK has no choice if it wants an agreement with the EU, is when it comes to the Irish border. Content is not availableBack in December, the UK and EU signed up to ensuring there would be no re-introduction of a hard border on the island of Ireland in order to safeguard the Good Friday accord. This is the reddest of red lines for the EU. All its normally fractious members are in agreement. And while the future relationship between the EU and UK remains foggy and undecided, Brussels is insisting on a time-unlimited, rock-solid backstop agreement to ensure that, as a last resort, and whatever else happens in Brexit talks, there will be no new hard border. And this is where there is further confusion at the moment - so hold on to your seat. The UK government is talking about a backstop agreement too, but it is referring to what customs arrangement could be put in place for the whole of the UK until a new post-Brexit customs deal is up and operational. This alone will not cut the mustard with the EU over Ireland. So - if and when the UK government finally reaches agreement on what it desires as the future EU-UK relationship - the warning from Brussels is this: pay attention to the Irish border; whatever else is agreed it could still bring the whole Brexit deal crashing down.

2018-06-12,Stop Brexit campaign,https://web.archive.org//web/20180613011225/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44331013,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowBest for Britain is this week launching a national campaign to stop Brexit. Who is behind it?Best for Britain aims to persuade MPs to back a referendum on the final Brexit deal secured by Theresa May when they vote on it in the autumn, with staying in the EU an option on the ballot paper.It would aim to persuade enough Leave voters to change their mind to vote to keep Britain in the EU - but the first stage of its campaign aims to generate pressure for another referendum.Its campaign slogan - already displayed on billboards in London, Birmingham, Manchester and Liverpool and in newspaper ads - is ""We all deserve a final say on the Brexit deal.""According to the Observer, Best for Britain will send a ""roadmap"" to MPs and peers, setting out how they could stop Brexit, when it launches its campaign on Friday. The group believes a referendum could be held in December, or possibly as late as February or March - when the UK is set to officially quit the EU - if Brussels agrees to it.It is targeting much of its campaigning muscle at the Labour Party's front bench, which is against another referendum - but it also needs at least 10 Conservative ""rebels"" on board in order to win a vote in Parliament on an amendment calling for a referendum.The campaign is also attempting to shore up support among Labour backbenchers sceptical about Brexit and is reportedly targeting 50 Leave-supporting Labour constituencies with billboard ads close to MPs' offices. The campaign will also lobby the big trade unions in an effort to exert pressure on the Labour leadership and is running a social-media campaign and a ""Labour Against Brexit"" speaking tour by leading Labour Remainers. It is also funding a grassroots campaign and has handed cash to local volunteers to ""help stop Brexit in your area"". Best for Britain was set up in April 2017, just before June's snap general election. Its initial aim was to encourage tactical voting to try to get more pro-Remain MPs into the House of Commons. The group said more than a million people had consulted its tactical voting website ahead of 8 June to find pro-Remain candidates.It reported spending £353,118 between June 2016 and June 2017, and made donations to pro-European candidates in marginal seats, including the Lib Dems' Tom Brake, Labour's Peter Kyle and Green MP Caroline Lucas. One of the group's founding members, Gina Miller, defeated the government over its power to trigger Article 50 without parliamentary consent, in the Supreme Court in January 2017. However, she stood down the day after the 2017 general election, saying the group had become too party political.Officially registered as UK-EU Open Policy Limited, Best for Britain is led by business and charity sector figures. This is in contrast to the MP-led People's Vote campaign - which is also pushing for a referendum on the final Brexit deal, although the two campaigns will join forces on 23 June to stage a march on Parliament.Best for Britain has £2.4m in its coffers and is asking donors for another £3.2m to realise its campaigning ambitions, according to its director of communications, Paul Butters, a former spokesman for Tim Farron, the ex-Liberal Democrat leader.The biggest individual donor is international financier George Soros, a Hungarian-born US citizen, who has given Best for Britain £800,000 in total so far, with £400,000 of that coming since the start of the year through his pro-European Open Society Foundation.Having made his billions in finance, including betting against sterling on Black Wednesday in 1992 - which gained him a reputation as the ""man who broke the Bank of England"" - Mr Soros, 87, donated more than £8bn to philanthropic causes between 1979 and 2011.UK electoral law bans foreign donations but only in the run-up to elections or referendums. Best for Britain says it has not taken money from overseas because the Soros donations came via his Open Society Foundations UK branch. The campaign is also keen to stress that it has also raised significant sums from more than 8,000 small donors.But the involvement of Mr Soros has generated a backlash in the Brexit-backing media, with the Daily Mail telling him on its front page: ""Butt out Mr Soros. You can keep your tainted money.""Mr Soros hit back at the Daily Mail's headline in an article for the Mail on Sunday, explaining why his love for Britain had led him to campaign against the ""tragic mistake"" of Brexit - and the campaign launched a Gofundme crowdfunding page entitled Help Best for Britain fight the Daily Mail, which has raised more than £64,000 in the past 12 days.Pro-Brexit campaign Leave Means Leave is, meanwhile, raising funds to combat Best for Britain, with its co-chairman John Longworth telling supporters in an email: ""We are determined to secure the swift, clean Brexit you all voted for.""Best for Britain is currently under investigation by the Electoral Commission, which oversees campaign spending, for submitting a return with invoices missing and for failing to return a donation of £25,000 from an impermissible donor within 30 days. It says it has complied with all relevant regulations.Lord Malloch-Brown, appointed 2 November 2017. A former foreign office minister, under Gordon Brown, who became a life peer in July 2007. Before that, he served as UN deputy secretary general, and from 1977 to 1979 he was a political correspondent at the pro-EU Economist, returning in 1983 for three years as founding editor of the Economist Development Report.The 64-year-old peer sparked controversy when he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme last month that Britain might as well stay in the EU, given the impossibility of divorcing itself from the Continent's problems. He said: ""Britain's history as an island nation adjacent to mainland Europe is when we try to, sort of, pull away from Europe's problems and close ourselves off to them, they have a horrible habit of infecting us anyway - appeasement in the 1930s, you name it. For centuries, Britain has ignored events on continental Europe at its peril.""Chief executive officer: Eloise Todd, 41. Until December 2016, Ms Todd worked in Brussels as global director of U2 singer Bono's anti-poverty charity, One. She had worked in the European Parliament for seven years after graduating from the College of Europe in Bruges.The Guardian has suggested that it was her personal connection to Best for Britain's biggest donor, George Soros, through the international development sector, that attracted him to the group, instead of better-known campaigns such as Open Britain, which is now part of the People's Vote group.Director: Sir Clive Cowdery, appointed 16 December 2016. The insurance businessman founded the Resolution Foundation think tank in 2005. He was chairman and chief executive of General Electric Insurance Holdings from 1998 to 2003. Knighted in the 2016 New Year Honours for services to children and social mobility, Sir Clive, 55, is worth an estimated £147m, according to the Sunday Times Rich List 2018, in which he ranked 804th in Britain. Director: Shakuntala Ghosh, appointed 3 March 2017. Chief executive of the charity Clore Social Leadership, which runs management training courses for charity workers, since April 2015, ""Shaks"" Ghosh, 61, led homelessness charity Crisis from 1997 to 2007. She has also held posts at the National Housing Federation and Centrepoint.Chief economist: Anatole Kaletsky, appointed 16 December 2016. Another former Economist journalist, Mr Kaletsky was appointed chairman of the Institute for New Economic Thinking in 2012, a foundation established after the 2008 financial crisis with $200m (£150m) of grants from, among others, George Soros. In 2010, he wrote Capitalism 4.0: The Birth of a New Economy in the Aftermath of Crisis.Director: Peter Norris, appointed 16 December 2016. Known as Sir Richard Branson's right-hand man, Mr Norris, 63, has been chairman of the Virgin Group since 2001. Sir Richard donated £25,000 and office space to the campaign in 2017 to help launch it. Before Virgin, Mr Norris was chief executive of Barings Bank when it collapsed in the Nick Leeson ""rogue trader"" scandal in 1995. He was temporarily banned from being a director by the Department of Trade and Industry in 1998.Director: Stephen Peel, appointed 19 October 2016. A former Goldman Sachs executive who represented Great Britain in rowing at the 1988 Seoul Olympics, Mr Peel, 52, has donated more than £75,000 to Best for Britain.Gina Miller: The businesswoman and philanthropist initially spearheaded Best for Britain, saying in her launch speech: ""Throughout the course of this general election campaign, we will be focusing on educating and empowering people to make a tactical vote and choosing MPs who will do the best for Britain. ""   But she stood down the day after the 2017 general election and has distanced herself from the group, saying it had become more focused on ""bringing down the Tories"" than Brexit.Alan Milburn: Chairman of the Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission from 2012 to 2017, the 60-year-old served in Tony Blair's government, as chief secretary to the Treasury from 1998 to 1999, then as secretary of state for health until 2003. He has been chancellor of Lancaster University since 2015. He resigned from Best of Britain on 3 March 2017.Sally Tallant: The director of the Liverpool Biennial festival of contemporary art, Sally Tallant, 50, resigned from the group in April 2017."
2018-06-12,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20180613011225/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks have now moved on to future relations - after agreement was reached on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree within six months on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide, but first let's go back to the basics...It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.1% in the first three months of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.4%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand near a 40-year year low of 4.2%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 4.2% in the year to March 2018, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May is seeking to put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. If passed, it will end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, is supposed to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each playing roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanAn agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement wopuld only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.The full details are not yet known but UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72.We don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pounds buy fewer euros. A slump in the value of the dollar means the exchange rate with the pound is pretty close to where it was before the referendum.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.The UK has proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.A method for calculating the bill has been agreed, but the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more.The question of how and when payments will be made still needs to resolved, but it will be a schedule lasting for many years to come, and it is highly unlikely that anyone will ever be able to give an exact figure for the size of the divorce bill.UK sources say it will be up to £40bn, but some EU sources expect it to be higher than that. No-one can say for sure, and both sides want to keep it that way.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 6.5% in 2016 to 2.7% in 2017, according to the Halifax. It said the slowdown was driven by a squeeze on real wage growth.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-06-12,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180613011225/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to £840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

On Friday, the Home Office is expected to confirm that foreign doctors and nurses will be excluded from the government's visa cap.The cap - introduced by Theresa May when she was Home Secretary - sets a limit for all non-EU skilled workers at 20,700 people a year.But NHS bosses say the rules are making it difficult to recruit enough staff.The proposed changes relate to so-called Tier 2 visas - which are used by skilled workers from outside the European Economic Area and Switzerland.On Tuesday, it was reported that 2,360 visa applications by doctors from outside the European Economic Area were refused in a five-month period, apparently because of the cap.And in April, NHS bosses warned that immigration rules were hampering their ability to find workers after visas for 100 Indian doctors were refused. In February, NHS England had 35,000 nurse vacancies and nearly 10,000 doctor posts unfilled.According to think tank Global Futures, 12.5% of NHS England's staff are from overseas. That number rises to 45% in certain specialities including paediatric cardiologists and neurosurgeons.The current annual cap on these visas has also led to over 1,000 IT specialists and engineers being denied visas.The proposed cap exclusion would only apply to doctors and nurses, but would free up thousands of visas for workers in other industries like IT and teaching.Current government policy aims to reduce net migration to below 100,000.Home secretary Sajid Javid hinted at the changes earlier this month, telling the BBC 's Andrew Marr that he ""saw the problem"" with the cap and would take a ""fresh look"" at it.His latest move could indicate a new direction for immigration policy post-Brexit, the BBC's political correspondent Ben Wright said.It could also encourage others to argue for the net migration target - which has never been met - to be abandoned, he said.""Perhaps this is a sign that Sajid Javid is willing to take a bolder and more flexible approach to immigration, and deliver the kind of system that Britain will need after we leave the EU,"" said Sunder Katwala, director of the immigration think-tank British Future.""It never made sense to turn away doctors and nurses that the NHS needs."""
2018-06-13,Brexit changes reversed amid Labour revolt,https://web.archive.org//web/20180614021331/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44474661,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAttempts to keep the UK in the European Economic Area after Brexit have been defeated in the House of Commons, amid a major Labour revolt over the issue.MPs reversed a move to retain the UK's EEA links after it leaves the EU next year, which had been backed by the House of Lords, by 327 votes to 126.Jeremy Corbyn urged his MPs to abstain but 75 voted for and 15 against, while six quit their frontbench roles.MPs overturned six further amendments inserted into key legislation by peers.Supporters of the EEA argue it would give the UK the closest possible relationship with the EU without actually being a member, as it would offer full access to the single market.But critics say it would require the UK to adhere to EU rules without having a say in them - and would not be in keeping with the spirit of the 2016 referendum result. All members of the EU also belong to the EEA, alongside non-EU countries Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein. In return for market access, the latter are obliged to make a financial contribution and accept the majority of EU laws. The free movement of people also applies in the zone as it does in the EU.The government won the EEA vote comfortably after Labour abstained, although three Tory MPs, Ken Clarke, Anna Soubry and Dominic Grieve, rebelled themselves and backed the motion.Please upgrade your browserDuring Commons exchanges, supporters of the EEA said it would be an economic ""lifeboat"" for the UK after Brexit by reducing the disruption to business. Laura Smith, the MP for Crewe and Nantwich, quit her job as shadow defence minister to vote against the EEA while Ged Killen, Tonia Antoniazzi, Anna McMorrin, Ellie Reeves and Rosie Duffield stepped down as parliamentary private secretaries to vote for it.  In a statement, Jeremy Corbyn said he understood the ""difficulties"" facing MPs ""representing constituencies which voted strongly for Leave or Remain"" on the issue of the EEA.But he insisted Labour could not support the so-called Norway model as he did not believe it was the ""right option"" for the UK.By political editor Laura KuenssbergA wiser head than me - there's dispute over whether it was Mark Twain or Bismarck! - once remarked that laws are like sausages, if you respect them it's best not to watch them being made.Well the last forty eight hours in Westminster may give weight to that. Farce? Fiasco? Or maybe today in Parliament has been in the best tradition of British pantomime.Or perhaps, this is in fact the completely predictable agony of split political parties, with leaders who struggle to command their troops, just trying to make it through after a huge vote that by its very nature, split the country in two.""It would leave us with next to no say over rules we have to follow, it does not allow us to negotiate a new comprehensive UK-EU customs union and it fails to resolve the Irish border issue,"" he said.Earlier, Labour failed in an attempt to amend the bill with their own alternative motion to guarantee ""full access"" to European markets after Brexit from outside the EEA. This was defeated by 322 votes to 240.MPs also overturned other changes made to the bill by the Lords, including a requirement for ministers to set out steps to negotiate a customs union with the EU.The government agreed a compromise with potential Tory rebels earlier this week to work towards a ""customs arrangement"" with the EU. This won the support of the Commons by 325 votes to 298.Other changes insisted upon by the Lords relating to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, principles of EU law to be retained after Brexit and EU environmental principles were also removed.  In response to the votes, Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable accused Labour of conspiring with the Conservatives to ""wave through a hard Brexit"".Resignation of Laura Smith and four PPS’ shows Labour leadership’s policy of waving through the Conservatives’ hard Brexit is no longer tenable. Time for Labour front-bench to join @LibDems in opposing the government on the biggest issue of the day. Together we can win.End of Twitter post  by @vincecableBut ministers did make one significant policy concession - on refugee policy after Brexit.They accepted a proposal by Labour MP Yvette Cooper to widen the terms under which unaccompanied child refugees can be reunited with family members living in the UK. Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The government had already agreed to allow unaccompanied children to claim asylum in the UK if it was deemed to be in their ""best interests"".But, following Ms Cooper's intervention, ministers have agreed to drop a clause stating this could only happen if their family members already in the UK were over 18 years of age. Solicitor General Robert Buckland said ministers had listened ""very carefully"" to the views of MPs from different parties and would amend the bill when it returns to the Lords next week. "

Here's what happened.This was an extraordinary session, dominated by the mass walkout of the SNP's MPs. You can read all about that here.That rather took the spotlight off what was meant to be the main event. For the second week running, Jeremy Corbyn focused his firepower on the government's handling of Brexit, mining the rich seam of material offered to him by Boris Johnson's leaked remarks to a private dinner.Why didn't Mrs May take the foreign secretary's advice and ask Donald Trump to take over Brexit negotiations, he asked.The PM was initially unable to answer as she was drowned out by the noise of MPs. Speaker Bercow reprimanded Brexit Secretary David Davis, saying: ""you must recover your composure"". Mrs May eventually managed to get her reply in - a swipe at Labour's position. MPs then fell silent as she made a detour to talk about the first anniversary of the Grenfell Tower fire - a subject raised by Mr Corbyn at the start of his question. “Many of them are still waiting for the security of a permanent home one year on from that disaster” @jeremycorbyn on #Grenfell before asking about Trump/Johnson on Brexit “It isn’t just about the building, not just the bricks and mortar of a home” @theresa_may #pmqs #bbcdp pic.twitter.com/P7NlNHaaXIEnd of Twitter post  by @daily_politicsShe said all of the 203 families left homeless by the tragedy had been offered new permanent or temporary accommodation and 183 had accepted an offer of a permanent home. She then paid tribute to the ""dignity and strength"" the victims of the fire had shown.Mr Corbyn also paid tribute to the families - but said the ""reality"" was that some of them still did not have homes. Turning back to Brexit, he asked whether the transition period would go on until December 2021.The PM guessed he was talking about the ""backstop"". She gave him a lecture on what the backstop is and why the government does not expect it ever to be used.“What December are we talking about?”  @jeremycorbyn on #Brexit timing“We don’t want the backstop to be necessary” @theresa_may #pmqs #bbcdp pic.twitter.com/lHVeo7gVOCEnd of Twitter post 2 by @daily_politics""I am not really sure whether it is a backstop or a backslide she is taking about here,"" said Mr Corbyn. He then asked - as he had done last week - when the government's Brexit white paper was going to be published. ""Where is it?"" bayed opposition MPs. ""Just calm down,"" the PM told them, it would be published after the June EU summit, she said.But Cabinet Office minister David Lidington had told the BBC it would be published in July, said Mr Corbyn. Mrs May, speaking as if explaining how the calendar works to a child, said: ""After the June European Council is July."" She then took a swipe at Labour ""divisions"" and a guide to deselecting Labour MPs which had reportedly been posted on the internet by activists.""You have got to face facts - there may well be a meltdown,"" said Mr Corbyn.A gleeful Mrs May pointed a finger at the Labour benches. No, explained the Labour leader, these were not his words but the words of Boris Johnson at that private dinner. Another smile from Mr Johnson. The foreign secretary appeared to want ""more friction and more disruption to the economy"" as a result of Brexit, he claimed.Mrs May replied with a list of Labour's shifting positions on Brexit, claiming that only her party could deliver the ""will of the British people"". “You have got to face the fact, there may well be a meltdown  @jeremycorbyn  correcting the PM who had corrected the Labour leader #bbcdp “The Conservative party in government are going to deliver on the will of the British people ” @theresa_may #pmqs #bbcdp pic.twitter.com/OG8pflHQ5WEnd of Twitter post 3 by @daily_politicsHer party was so divided on Brexit they were even whispering about her behind her back at Prime Minister's Questions, said Mr Corbyn. ""How much more damage is the prime minister going to do to the country before she realises the important thing is to get a deal for the people of this country, not one to appease the clashing giant egos of her Cabinet?""It was the Labour Party that was trying to ""frustrate"" Brexit, said Mrs May. She threw in an attack on the last Labour government's record on employment before unveiling her big joke.Labour had organised a music festival, Labour Live, she told MPs - ""I will pass over the fact that it is going to have a solidarity tent, which obviously won't have any Labour MPs"" - but the two headlining acts were ""the shadow chancellor and the Magic Numbers"".""That just about sums them up,"" she said.The SNP's leader at Westminster Ian Blackford pulled what is known in the trade as an ""I spy strangers move"" in protest at what he said was a ""power grab"" during last night's debate on the EU Withdrawal Bill. Mr Blackford demanded a vote on holding an emergency debate on Brexit and devolution after, he said, the SNP had been denied a voice on the matter in Tuesday's debate.Mrs May refused and said Brexit would give more power to Holyrood and, in any case, it was Labour that was to blame for the procedural manoeuvrings on Tuesday night.Slightly chaotic scenes followed as Speaker Bercow consulted his clerks and got into a spat with Mr Blackford, who refused to back down, telling him at one point: ""Don't tell me what the procedures of this house are - there can be a vote at the end of this session and not now.""The SNP eventually walked out en masse, leaving a large gap in the order paper, which had five SNP MPs lined up to ask the PM a question.Tory MP Luke Hall, the first to be called after the debacle, said the mass walkout reminded him of one of his after dinner speeches.Jacob Rees-Mogg gave Mrs May a sharp reminder of the Brexiteers' demands for the government not to be over-ruled by Parliament on Brexit, following Mrs May's concessions on a ""meaningful vote"" that enabled her to avoid debate in Tuesday's Withdrawal Bill vote. ""The job of government and the job of Parliament is different"" says @Jacob_Rees_Mogg to @theresa_may whosays ""government must be accountable to Parliament"" over Tuesday's #Brexit vote pic.twitter.com/i4DxFxARgeEnd of Twitter post 4 by @daily_politicsHere's the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg on what the SNP walk-out means for Theresa May:""The relationship with the devolved administrations - with Cardiff and Holyrood - has gone bust"" @bbclaurak on #SNPwalkout over #Brexit debate#bbcdp #pmqs pic.twitter.com/1t50xTmfkDEnd of Twitter post 5 by @daily_politicsHere's the BBC's Mark D'Arcy's take on the session:Phew! First a really lively set of exchanges between Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May, then an orchestrated display of SNP fury, culminating in a walkout.The exchanges between the leaders had a rare level of personal needle - and the stare the PM gave Jeremy Corbyn, when he taunted her with the leaked comments made by Boris Johnson, suggested he had scored a direct hit.And he then continued with the simple tactic of quoting the Foreign Secretary's words against his boss. Neither of his targets enjoyed the experience.Given the government's current Brexit disarray, he had an open goal before him, but he's missed before - and this time the ball thundered into the back of the net.(Conservative Brexiteers will have been pleased, though, by the PM's later replies to Jacob Rees Mogg and Philip Davies, setting her face against a ""meaningful vote"" on Brexit that could risk overturning the referendum verdict.)Then came Ian Blackford. His protest, attempt to force a vote, and subsequent walkout may all be mocked in Westminster, but they may play differently with Scottish voters.I'm old enough to remember Nick Clegg making a protest in 2008, about the treatment of the then third party, the Lib Dems, (ironically on an amendment calling for an EU referendum) and briefly discomforting Speaker Martin.His frontbencher Ed Davey was ordered out of the chamber, and Mr Clegg then led a walkout - calling the Speaker's ruling a ""constitutional outrage"".Third parties traditionally find the way the Commons works, which is carved up between the government and the main opposition party, intensely frustrating.The SNP are good at using Westminster for clever, social media-savvy political theatre - perhaps because they don't hold it in quite the same reverence as the other parties; remember them whistling ""Ode to Joy"" during a division on the EU (Withdrawal) Bill? I would not be surprised if they try to generate a few more YouTube moments.The other issue that might worry the PM is the trains. Both Conservative Nadine Dorries and Labour's Jeff Smith raised it - and while Brexit dominates Westminster, many MPs will return to their constituencies at the weekend, to find their voters fulminating about packed or cancelled trains.Oh, and for the first time, PMQs breached the 1pm mark; it had to happen, I suppose.An audio download of some of the key exchanges, and what Jo Coburn and her Daily Politics guests made of the exchanges.It was a lively one...

2018-06-13,SNP MPs walk out of PMQs in protest,https://web.archive.org//web/20180614021331/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44467306,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowSNP MPs have walked out en masse from Prime Minister's Questions after their Westminster leader was thrown out of the chamber in a row with the Speaker.Ian Blackford refused to sit down when ordered to by John Bercow having asked for the Commons to sit in private.This was in protest at a lack of debate on what he said was a ""power grab"" in the EU Withdrawal Bill.It brought PMQs to a temporary halt as the Speaker consulted his officials on what to do next.Mr Bercow said MPs could vote on the request for a private sitting at the end of PMQs - but when Mr Blackford refused to sit back down he was suspended for the rest of the day's sitting.His fellow SNP MPs followed him out of the chamber.The episode took place during the weekly Prime Minister's Questions session after Mr Blackford said it was a ""democratic outrage"" that MPs had not been given enough time to debate measures he described as a ""power grab"" by Westminster from Scotland.He added: ""Under the circumstances, given the disrespect that's shown, I have got no option but to ask that this House now sits in private.""Mr Bercow said it was better for a vote on his request to take place at the end of the session - but the SNP MP did not agree, rejecting repeated orders from the Speaker to resume his seat.The next MP to be called for a question was Conservative MP Luke Hall, who joked: ""With the amount of people leaving, it feels like one of my after-dinner speeches.""Speaking afterwards, Mr Blackford told the BBC's Daily Politics his party would ""use Parliamentary procedures to best effect"" to protest against what he said was devolution being ""ripped up"" as powers are repatriated from Brussels.His suspension from the Commons means he is unable to take part in the second day of  debate on the EU Withdrawal Bill.Parliament retains the right to hold debates in private and any MP can propose that members of the public and press be removed from the galleries at any time.If such a proposal is made, the Commons Speaker must put the motion ""That this House sit in private"" to a vote without debate.But the procedure is seldom successful - attempts to exclude members of the public are usually deployed as a device to disrupt or delay the House's proceedings.MPs used to call out ""I spy strangers"" to invoke this procedure, but this phrase was replaced with the current wording in 1998.The EU Withdrawal Bill is a key plank of the government's Brexit strategy, aiming to ensure a smooth transition on Brexit day when EU law no longer applies in the UK.But the Scottish Parliament has refused to give its consent to the legislation, saying policy in devolved areas that is currently decided in Brussels is being reclaimed by Westminster.The bill is currently making its way through Parliament  - and although devolution was to be debated in the second half of Tuesday's session, there were only a few minutes left for this after voting on amendments went on for almost three hours.The Brexit bill says that the ""vast majority"" of the 158 areas where policy in devolved areas is currently decided in Brussels will go directly to the Scottish and Welsh parliaments after Brexit.But it has also named 24 areas where it wants to retain power temporarily in the wake of Britain's exit from the EU, including in areas such as agriculture, fisheries, food labelling and public procurement.It says the ""temporary restriction"" on the devolved governments using some of the powers returning from the EU is needed ""to help ensure an orderly departure from EU law"" and allow the same rule and regulations to remain in place across the whole of the UK.But the Scottish government argues that it would leave Holyrood unable to pass laws in some devolved areas for up to seven years.It has produced its own alternative Brexit legislation, which was passed by MSPs in March but is currently subject to a legal challenge by the UK government."
2018-06-13,Female MP in 'dilation' row with Bercow,https://web.archive.org//web/20180614021331/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44471407,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowConservative minister Claire Perry has accused John Bercow of making ""sexist"" comments about her after he told her to avoid ""dilation"" in the Commons. She said he had used ""demeaning language"" while chiding her for taking too long to answer questions.Comments ""about me being dilated"" had caused ""surprise and dismay"" among MPs from all sides, she said.A spokeswoman for Mr Bercow said he often used the word in the context of trying to speed up Commons business. The word dilated is commonly associated with childbirth, being the moment when a pregnant woman's cervix opens up sufficiently to allow labour to take place. But dilated can also be used to refer to someone ""speaking or writing at length"" on a subject. The Speaker's conduct has come under scrutiny in recent months amid claims - that he has denied - that he has acted aggressively to members of his staff.Ms Perry has now written to Mr Bercow to ask him to ""consider his behaviour"" in light of comments he made during Tuesday's Department of Business Questions. Urging her to give ""shorter answers"" to questions from backbenchers, he said the Commons had a ""lot to get through"" and that ""dilation is not in order today"". Ms Perry, who has three children, replied: ""The last time I talked about dilation, I was in labour.""In response, Mr Bercow said ""what is required is a brief answer and a brief question - no dilation"". In her letter, Ms Perry said she had become accustomed to the ""occasional irascible outburst"" from the Speaker which, while ""never enjoyable"", she accepted could be considered part of the ""rough and tumble of government"".But she said she took exception to the ""tone and language"" used to ""admonish me for giving over-long answers that seemed both overly aggressive and particularly sexist"".The minister added. ""Your comments about me being dilated have especially caused comment. ""Of course you may have misspoken, hence my attempt to lighten the mood with a reference to the last time I was dilated but this only provoked a further outburst of anger.""She claimed a ""pattern of behaviour"" was emerging which suggested Mr Bercow had a ""woman problem"" and found it ""increasingly hard to interact respectfully with female MPs on the government benches"".A spokeswoman for the Speaker's Office said Mr Bercow meant nothing derogatory in the remark. ""During question time yesterday, the Speaker was trying to move business along ahead of the much-anticipated debate on the EU (Withdrawal) Bill. ""He simply urged the minister to give a 'brief answer … no dilation' - in other words, he was asking Ms Perry not to speak at length. It is a term he has used many times before.""In his own reply to Ms Perry, the Speaker said he did not agree with her assertions but suggested they meet for a cup of tea to ""clear the air"". Mr Bercow, who has been Speaker since 2009, has incurred the wrath of some ministers over the years by telling them to be more concise in the Commons, once cutting off David Cameron half way through an answer and telling him ""take it from me he has finished"". The Speaker came under fire last month amid unconfirmed claims that he had called Commons leader Andrea Leadsom a ""stupid woman"" in the chamber. He admitted using the word stupid as a ""muttered aside"" but only in the context of the government's handling of parliamentary business and insisted that he had every respect for Mrs Leadsom and all his colleagues."

One of the potential rebels, Dominic Grieve, warned there would be consequences for the government if not.BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said a government source had told her no actual concessions had been agreed. And a senior minister, Solicitor General Robert Buckland, said the government had only agreed to ""further discussions"" about the way in which they could make ""a further step forward"".A group of MPs said on Tuesday they were offered, in a last-minute concession, real ""input"" if no deal with the EU was done by December. Details of precisely what this will involve could emerge in the coming days when the EU Withdrawal Bill is due to return to the House of Lords.The UK is due to leave the European Union on 29 March next year, after the referendum in 2016 when people voted by 51.9% to 48.1% to leave.The government is trying to pass a new law, called the EU Withdrawal Bill, which it says is needed to ensure a ""smooth and orderly Brexit"".Its main purposes are to end the supremacy of EU law in the UK, and transfer existing EU law into UK law so the same rules and regulations apply on the day after Brexit.But as it passes through Parliament, MPs and peers have been trying to change it, in some cases adding bits on that would change the government's Brexit strategy.Given that politicians, like the rest of the country, are divided on what Brexit should look like, this is posing problems for the government as it tries to get the bill through both the House of Commons and the House of Lords.The government is currently trying to persuade MPs to undo most of the changes made by the House of Lords, and on Tuesday this involved a tussle over how much of a say Parliament will get if it does not like the deal struck between the UK and the EU.The government does not want to give MPs and peers the power to say what sort of Brexit deal the UK should strike with the EU, saying this should be left to ministers.When it came to the key vote, a group of Conservatives who had threatened to rebel agreed at the last minute not to defeat the government after public haggling between ministers and would-be rebels and a meeting between Mrs May and more than a dozen Tory MPs.But it is not yet clear exactly what the MPs were offered and whether they are happy with what has since been said by ministers.""I expect the government to honour its commitments and I expect the PM to honour her commitments and I have no reason to distrust the approach she took with us,"" one of the would-be rebels, Dominic Grieve, told the BBC's Newsnight. Ahead of the vote Mr Grieve tried to broker a compromise between MPs and ministers which would apply if Parliament rejects the final UK-EU Brexit deal.Under his proposals, the government would then have to seek MPs' approval for its plan of action through a motion in the House of Commons. It would also have to do this if no deal has been agreed by the end of November 2018.Ministers have agreed to consider these suggestions - but not a third strand of his proposals which would require the government to ""follow any direction"" from MPs if there is no deal by 15 February 2019.Remain-supporting Conservatives Anna Soubry and Nicky Morgan were two of the MPs to meet with Mrs May. Ms Soubry said she trusted Mrs May to ""honour the undertaking she gave"".Ms Morgan told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""What was agreed was the prime minister understood that Parliament wants to have a real say, in all circumstances, in relation to what's going to happen in the Brexit deal.""But Bernard you weren’t there and I was. I trust our PM to honour the undertaking she gave.

And, for me, it's a betrayal of the British people.""Tuesday's Commons debate marked the start of the government's attempts to undo most of the changes to its EU Withdrawal Bill that were put forward by the House of Lords.Prior to the votes, the government suffered its first ministerial resignation over Brexit as Phillip Lee quit the Ministry of Justice so he could speak out freely.A series of further votes will take place on Wednesday, with no defeats expected after ministers agreed compromise wording over post-Brexit plans for a ""customs arrangement"".

It comes a day after Rhun ap Iorwerth, a senior Plaid Cymru AM, said he had no plans to challenge for the leadership of the party.He has previously aired his own leadership ambitions, should a vacancy emerge.""I'm very pleased to have his backing to be the first minister candidate up to 2021,"" Ms Wood said, noting that Mr ap Iorwerth had been ""fairly strong and unequivocal"". The Plaid leader said she would not see it as a ""betrayal"" if he was to change his mind. ""I would welcome the opportunity to have that debate"", she said."

The survey, which was set up by Queen's and Ulster Universities, found that 55% of those interviewed would vote for Northern Ireland to remain in the UK. This compares to only 22% who said they would back a United Ireland. Last week, the BBC published a survey that suggested a much tighter race. Responding to the Northern Ireland Life and Times Survey, 12% said they would not vote and the remaining 10% said they did not know how they would vote.In total, 1,203 adults aged 18 years or over were interviewed face to face between September 2017 and February 2018.According to the BBC's survey on identity, which was carried out by the Belfast pollsters Lucid Talk, only 47% of people in Northern Ireland identified themselves as strongly British. The online and telephone survey said that 45% of respondents backed staying in the UK and 42% favoured a United Ireland. This left undecided voters potentially playing a crucial role.Last month, an Ipsos Mori poll conducted face to face indicated that 50% favoured staying in the UK, whilst only 21% backed a United Ireland. Some 33% of those interviewed for the Life and Times Survey said that they think Brexit has made a United Ireland more likely, whilst 9% believe it has made it less likely and 43% believe it makes no difference.Asked whether Northern Ireland will be financially better off when the UK leaves the EU, 41% disagreed and 18% agreed."

Thank god, the government sighed collectively. Another day when last-minute haggling avoided the red faces of getting beaten by MPs and avoided what ministers believe would be an impossible restriction on their ability to negotiate a Brexit deal - a condition the House of Lords wants to set where Parliament would be able to direct Number 10 if the final Brexit deal is sunk. Hang on. The defeat was only stopped in its tracks because more than a dozen Tory rebels got what they believe is a real promise from the prime minister that the draft law will be changed. Three of them have told me that Theresa May said it is a ""matter of trust"". But was that a real promise? Pity the government minister who had, in public, to broker the deal during hours at the despatch box, the Solicitor General Robert Buckland. When I asked him tonight what had really been agreed, he was crystal clear that there has been  no assurance or guarantee that the government will actually make a change to its plans, just a commitment to ""further discussions"" to try to find a way forward that may well result in a tweak - such as a new amendment.Politics is often about the big picture, but sometimes it is a festival for pedants. Believe me, in Westminster, there is a very very big difference between the promise of more serious chat about something with the possibility of a change, and a promise actually to do something different, especially if it is made by the occupant of Number 10. So just hours after the concession, (or non-concession) very very dark mutterings began from those who had been persuaded by what they thought was a promise. Some can't be repeated on air or in this blog, suffice to say one of them told me the PM should not mess with them. Another at the meeting was furious, saying ""the problem is she is weak and stubborn, it's the worst combination"". On the other side, the Brexiteers believe they have had their own assurances that nothing has actually been promised and the Remainers are trying to save face. The government has until Thursday to come up with whatever the product of the ""further conversations"" will be. But the prime minister has been able to get this far by giving assurances, in turn, to all sides in the Tory party. The risk is that appears as double dealing. One senior Brexiteer says people are starting to see that the prime minister ""talks from two different sides of her mouth"". Instead of peace and harmony after the government avoided a defeat tonight there is ill will and mistrust. The immediate disaster of defeat was avoided but the action taken to stop it happening may have made the situation even worse. "

The ruling will be closely read by others with similar disputes, many of whom work for firms in the so-called gig economy.An employment tribunal was ""entitled to conclude"" that Mr Smith was a worker, the court ruled.As a worker Mr Smith would be entitled to employment rights, such as holiday and sick pay.Pimlico Plumbers chief executive Charlie Mullins said he was ""disgusted by the approach taken to this case by the highest court in the United Kingdom"".  Mr Mullins said: ""This was a poor decision that will potentially leave thousands of companies, employing millions of contractors, wondering if one day soon they will get nasty surprise from a former contractor demanding more money, despite having been paid in full years ago.  ""It can only lead to a tsunami of claims,"" he added. Tim Goodwin of law firm Winckworth Sherwood cautioned that the ruling may not apply to other complaints.""Even with a high level decision like this, to a degree the issue of employment status in the gig economy is up in the air.  ""The government is consulting on this issue, and may bring forward legislation.  So it's quite possible that Parliament may overrule this decision within the next few months or years.""And Alan Lewis, employment partner at law firm Irwin Mitchell said the decision was not a ""game changer"" and that cases would continue to be argued on their specific facts and, for businesses that rely on self employed contracts, that means further uncertainty.""This decision is not necessarily a win  for 'gig economy' workers seeking to challenge their employment status.""  Pimlico Plumbers does ""not operate a gig model and the implications for Uber, City Sprint, Deliveroo etc may be limited,  although the publicity around this case may encourage other 'self employed' contractors to challenge their legal status,"" added Mr Lewis.The Supreme Court ruling means that an employment tribunal can now proceed to examine Mr Smith's action against Pimlico Plumbers as a worker, including a claim that he was unfairly dismissed.Could the Pimlico Plumbers ruling be a watershed moment, a decisive shift in favour of people seeking employment rights?It is a powerful precedent and the fact that the judgment comes from the Supreme Court means that it will weigh heavily when similar cases come to be heard.However other cases, like those involving Uber and Deliveroo are unlikely to be stopped in their tracks. Each firm has a different way of operating, different contracts and makes different demands on people working.Some allow you to get someone else to do the job instead, for instance, while others do not.That's one of the key tests of employment status.So there's a bit more clarity now, but expect the court challenges from gig workers to keep coming.TUC General Secretary Frances O'Grady said the case had exposed ""how widely sham self-employment has spread"".Ms O'Grady said the TUC wanted the government to act quickly to ""crack down on bogus self-employment"" .At the moment it is up to an individual to prove that they are employed and entitled to workers' rights. The TUC wants the ""burden of proof"" to be reversed so workers benefit from rights ""unless the employer can show they are genuinely self-employed"".""It's time to end the Wild West in the gig economy,"" said Ms O'Grady.In February the government promised to overhaul employment rights to improve conditions for millions of workers, including those in the gig economy.The proposed changes include stricter enforcement of holiday and sick pay rights, and higher fines for firms that breach contracts or mistreat staff. It is currently consulting on the proposals.It is a response to last year's Taylor Review into the gig economy, which concluded that all work in the UK's economy should be ""fair and decent"" and that people who work for platform-based companies, such as Deliveroo and Uber should be classed as dependent contractors.Author Matthew Taylor said that the combination of the Supreme Court decision and the government's proposals to reduce the tax incentives for companies to employ freelancers, would ""inevitably squeeze firms' freelance budgets"".""This is generally a good thing, especially if it leads to more people who are employees in all-but-name securing proper workplace rights,"" he said.Mr Smith, from Kent, began his battle with Pimlico Plumbers when he wanted to reduce his hours following a heart attack in 2010.He wanted to cut the five-day week, which he had been signed up to work with the firm, to three.However, the firm refused and took away his branded van, which he had hired. He claims he was dismissed."

A Conservative source said they expect their party group to back the appointment.It is not clear how many AMs will vote against Mr Hamilton, and whether that opposition will be enough to stop his appointment if Tory and UKIP AMs back him.But sources believe many in the Labour group will oppose Mr Hamilton, with some abstaining.Commissioners oversee different aspects of the operation of the assembly - and earn more money than ordinary backbench AMs.There are four and each party group gets to nominate one. Normally, who does the job is a matter for the parties concerned. It is highly unusual for the choice to be vetoed. But nominations still have to be confirmed in the Senedd.Before he lost his job as leader Mr Hamilton abstained on an interim assembly policy aimed at tackling inappropriate behaviour. Most of the assembly had supported it.Mr Hamilton has said the policy could lead to members facing ""surveillance"" by ""outsiders"".Confirming that she would vote against the nomination Vikki Howells, Labour AM for Cynon Valley, said: ""The dignity and respect policy is fundamental to how the assembly must operate and I cannot countenance supporting someone who has failed to endorse that policy.""Another source said there was a ""strong feeling"" within the Labour group that Mr Hamilton's abstention on the policy made him unsuitable given he would be involved in upholding it.At least one Plaid AM expected to vote against the appointment but BBC Wales has heard that another AM in the party feels uncomfortable about breaking the precedent on commission appointments.A source said there had been similar concerns within Labour, prior to the offering of a free vote.One Welsh Conservative said they thought it was ""irregular to try and tell a group who they can and can't put forward"".If Mr Hamilton is successful in his bid to be an assembly commissioner he will gain an extra £13,578 on top of his £66,847 basic backbench AMs' salary, bringing his total pay to £80,425.He had earned £85,000 a year as leader.One of the commissioners is Joyce Watson - a Labour AM who has been the target of criticism of Mr Hamilton over her description of UKIP AMs as ""rabid dogs"" in a debate a year ago.Speaking in May, and before the nomination was tabled, Ms Jones told BBC Wales that David Rowlands originally asked to do the job, but ""gave way"" to Neil Hamilton because he ""so enjoyed"" his role as chairman of the petitions committee."

Without debate, without the voices of the Scottish MPs being heard, the government pushed through these amendments to rip out the powers from the Scottish Parliament.""Scottish Labour's Ian Murray dismissed claims that the lack of debate time was a failure of the House of Commons system.He said on Good Morning Scotland: ""It wasn't adequate. The government are completely in charge of the timetable. They could have given us 20 days or 100 days to debate this. ""This isn't a failure of Commons Standing Orders or a failure of the system - it's a failure of the government to provide a proper programme motion for debate.""The Secretary of State for Scotland said it was right that the bill should not fall as a result of Holyrood failing to support it.David Mundell said: ""Ian Blackford may see his role in discussions with Nicola Sturgeon to roll over and agree with her - I don't see it as my role.""I see it as my role to stand up for the constitutional settlement that people voted for and that is that the Scottish Parliament does not have a veto over what happens in the rest of the UK.""MSPs voted by a margin of 93 to 30 to refuse consent for the Brexit legislation last month, with Labour, the Greens and Lib Dems backing the SNP in the final vote.It followed a lengthy row between the Scottish and UK governments about how powers coming back from Brussels after Brexit will be used.Changes have been made to the bill to reflect a deal struck between the UK and Welsh governments, but Mr Russell says these do not go far enough.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon wrote to the Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, on Sunday urging him to let MPs ""properly"" debate devolved consent.But with the UK government seeking to overturn many of the 15 defeats they suffered as the Withdrawal Bill passed through the House of Lords, there was ultimately little time for discussion of devolution.This will be the first time since the Scottish Parliament was re-established in 1999 that Westminster will have legislated across a devolved matter without the consent of MSPs.The Brexit bill says that the ""vast majority"" of the 158 areas where policy in devolved areas is currently decided in Brussels will go directly to the Scottish and Welsh parliaments after Brexit.But it has also named 24 areas where it wants to retain power temporarily in the wake of Britain's exit from the EU, including in areas such as agriculture, fisheries, food labelling and public procurement.It says the ""temporary restriction"" on the devolved governments using some of the powers returning from the EU is needed ""to help ensure an orderly departure from EU law"" and allow the same rule and regulations to remain in place across the whole of the UK.But the Scottish government argues that it would leave Holyrood unable to pass laws in some devolved areas for up to seven years.It has produced its own alternative Brexit legislation, which was passed by MSPs in March but is currently subject to a legal challenge by the UK government.Read more here"

Scotland's first minister says the passage of the UK's key Brexit legislation without the consent of the Scottish Parliament has ""ripped up the 20-year-old devolution convention"" in the UK. Is she right?Ms Sturgeon's tweet came after the House of Commons spent less than 20 minutes debating the EU Withdrawal Bill's impact on devolution. The SNP said that showed ""contempt for Scottish democracy"", with the party's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, leading a walk-out of his MPs during Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday.The row centres on a so-called ""power grab"", with the Scottish government accusing Westminster of keeping powers for itself that should go to the Scottish Parliament at Holyrood, after Brexit.  The UK government says the ""temporary"" move will allow the same rules and regulations to remain in place across the whole of the UK in 24 key areas, such as agriculture, fisheries and food labelling.Months of talks have failed to reach a deal - although the Welsh government dropped its opposition after changes were made that would put a limit on how long the UK government would keep the powers.Last month, the Scottish Parliament voted overwhelmingly to refuse consent for the Brexit bill, with the SNP being joined by Labour, the Greens and Liberal Democrat MSPs and only the Conservatives voting against. The UK government pressed on regardless - so how was it able to do so? When the devolved Scottish Parliament was set up in 1999, it was handed control over many policy areas such as health and education that had previously been decided at Westminster.However, an agreement signed by the two governments in 2001 stated that ""the United Kingdom Parliament retains authority to legislate on any issue, whether devolved or not"" and that it was ""ultimately for parliament to decide what use to make of that power"". It also stated that the UK government ""will proceed in accordance with the convention that the UK Parliament would not normally legislate with regard to devolved matters except with the agreement of the devolved legislature"". This agreement was inserted into the Scotland Act in 2016, which was drawn up after the independence referendum two years earlier and confirmed that Westminster ""will not normally legislate with regard to devolved matters without the consent of the Scottish Parliament"".The word ""normally"" is, of course, an important caveat that is open to different interpretations - is Brexit ""normal"", for example?Consent is sought through something known as the Sewel Convention, named after former Labour government minister Lord Sewel, which, in effect, allowed the UK government to ask MSPs for permission to change the law in an area that is devolved to Holyrood. Similar conventions apply in both Wales and Northern Ireland. Until Brexit came along, the Scottish Parliament had only once before refused to give its consent - over some aspects of the Welfare Reform Bill in 2011, which resulted in the Scottish government introducing its own legislation to resolve the row. So Ms Sturgeon is correct to say that pushing through the EU Withdrawal Bill without the consent of the Scottish Parliament means that the long-standing convention has, in effect, been ""ripped up"".However, as its name suggests, it is merely a convention and there is no legal requirement for the UK government to seek Holyrood's permission - or to respect its decision if it says ""no"". This was confirmed by the Supreme Court last year, when it ruled on the case brought by Gina Miller about the triggering of Article 50, which started the Brexit process. Judges ruled that the Sewel Convention was not a legally enforceable rule despite being inserted into the Scotland Act.This meant that the Scottish Parliament did not have a veto over Article 50 or, by extension, the EU Withdrawal Bill. Regardless, ignoring the result of the Scottish Parliament vote was sure to provoke fury from the SNP, with Ms Sturgeon warning that ""the decision to act without our consent, and the manner of doing it, will not be forgotten"".Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questionsFollow us on Twitter"

She was so supportive towards the former attorney general, as he argued for Parliament to have a ""meaningful vote"" on the terms of the Brexit deal, that it seemed probable she would join the Euro-rebels in voting for it….For some time the government Chief Whip Julian Smith had been flitting round the Chamber talking to his troops - then he went and had a word with the Solicitor General, Robert Buckland, the government's in-house legal eagle, who is dealing with the techie legal aspects of the EU (Withdrawal) Bill. Soon after, Mr Buckland intervened on Mr Grieve to suggest talks over a compromise deal. It appeared that the head count had been done, and the concession followed. Most dangerousThe meaningful vote is probably the most dangerous of the Lords amendments to the EU (Withdrawal) Bill - because it tees up an unpredictable vote on the final terms of Brexit, towards the end of this year, and opens up the possibility that MPs could demand that ministers change policy, in the event the terms were rejected by the House, or no deal was reached in the talks with the EU….. they could even demand (drumroll) a second referendum…The government would not have sought a deal if it thought it had the votes to win, and they clearly blinked. The decision to seek a compromise marked an important victory for the soft Brexit/Remainer/""realist"" Tory rebels, who have been promised an amendment giving them most of what they want. As I write the full terms of the deal have yet to be revealed, but there is briefing ministers have conceded that a motion, which could be amended, would be put before MPs, in event a final divorce deal is voted down. In other words, in the event of a divorce deal that the Commons refused to accept, MPs would be able to set a new course for Brexit. This whole idea was denounced by Brexiteers as a Trojan horse for Remainers, and for a second referendum, so that concession could well produce some blowback. But for now, the government seems to have prevented an embarrassing defeat, and the Tory rebels have avoided the unpleasantness of colluding in the defeat of their Prime Minister. One of the leading Tory rebels has told the BBC ""the government has bent not broken"" but it leaves the ""fight for another day"".But ministers now know that a narrow but decisive Commons majority can be assembled against them on critical Brexit issues, and that its next outing could well be on a more substantive vote on a customs union. Will that knowledge mean a softer Brexit strategy will now emerge?"

The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks have now moved on to future relations - after agreement was reached on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree within six months on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide, but first let's go back to the basics...It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.1% in the first three months of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.4%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand near a 40-year year low of 4.2%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 4.2% in the year to March 2018, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May is seeking to put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. If passed, it will end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, is supposed to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each playing roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanAn agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement wopuld only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.The full details are not yet known but UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72.We don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pounds buy fewer euros. A slump in the value of the dollar means the exchange rate with the pound is pretty close to where it was before the referendum.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.The UK has proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.A method for calculating the bill has been agreed, but the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more.The question of how and when payments will be made still needs to resolved, but it will be a schedule lasting for many years to come, and it is highly unlikely that anyone will ever be able to give an exact figure for the size of the divorce bill.UK sources say it will be up to £40bn, but some EU sources expect it to be higher than that. No-one can say for sure, and both sides want to keep it that way.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 6.5% in 2016 to 2.7% in 2017, according to the Halifax. It said the slowdown was driven by a squeeze on real wage growth.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-06-13,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180614021331/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to £840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

As I write, Mrs May is holed up with her advisers inside Tory HQ. But a former minister Anna Soubry has called for her to ""consider her position"" - political code for calling for her to resign. Read more from LauraJohn Curtice, Professor of Politics at the University of StrathclydeThis is the third post-war snap election called unexpectedly before a party's term of office had come to an end.  On the two previous occasions in 1970 and February 1974 the PM and the party lost office. While there is no other conceivable administration in the new parliament other than a Conservative-led one, it remains to be seen whether the PM will retain her position. However, so long as the Conservatives can reach an accommodation with the DUP they will have a working majority in the House of Commons.  BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed:When the general election exit poll was revealed at 10pm, the pound immediately dropped by 2% as investors took a position that a hung parliament was a possible outcome of the general election.Why would that cause the currency to decline? Because a hung parliament means that the government's direction of travel would be less certain.

2018-06-14,Tory rebels reject May's Brexit compromise,https://web.archive.org//web/20180615032621/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44482652,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe government's compromise to avoid a Commons defeat on Brexit has been rejected as ""unacceptable"" by leading rebel Dominic Grieve. Theresa May had convinced most rebels - who want MPs to have the final say - to back her in a key vote on Tuesday night by giving them assurances.But the wording of the promised compromise has now been published.Mr Grieve, who had talks on Thursday with ministers, said he could not understand why the change was made.BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said Remain-leaning Tory MPs were furious and it set the scene for another big showdown when the bill returns to Parliament next week.Mr Grieve said he had been involved in talks for two days and: ""at the end of the process something was inexplicably changed, which had not been agreed. ""The government has made the motion unamendable, contrary to the usual methods of the House of Commons. And therefore it cannot be accepted.""Asked what he would do next, on BBC One's Question Time, he said: ""I think a group of us will talk further to the government and try to resolve it.""He said he would listen to the government but added: ""I hope they listen to me when I say I don't understand why you've done this last-minute switch.""He said the problem was that if the UK reached ""the really apocalyptic moment"" where no Brexit deal had been done by early February 2019, Parliament was not being offered the chance to say what should happen next - only to ""note"" the position.Solicitor General Robert Buckland said he wouldn't get into ""some Tory psychodrama"" about whether the prime minister had caved into Brexiteers' demands but stressed ""no deals were done"" and the amendment was a ""genuine attempt to find a way through"".And a spokesman for the Department for Exiting the European Union said it ""ensures that in all circumstances Parliament can hold government to account, while also allowing government to deliver on the will of the British people"".He added: ""But this remains hypothetical and the government is confident we will agree a good deal with the EU which Parliament will support.""The government's amendment to the EU (Withdrawal) Bill sets out what must happen if the prime minister announces before 21 January 2019 that no deal has been reached with the EU either on the withdrawal agreement or the future relationship.Under these circumstances, a minister must make a statement in Parliament within 14 days and give MPs an opportunity to vote.However, the vote would be on ""a motion in neutral terms"", merely stating that the House has considered the statement.Mr Grieve had originally wanted the amendment to say that the government must seek the approval of Parliament for its course of action - and that ministers must be directed by MPs and peers.Just two Conservative MPs - Anna Soubry and Ken Clarke - voted against the government after failing to be persuaded by Mrs May's compromise promise.Ms Soubry said colleagues who had agreed to the compromise would now feel ""badly let down"", and she accused Mrs May of ""siding with the hard Brexiteers"" in her party.Conservative Brexiteers argued that the government must have the final say on any Brexit deal.Labour's shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said: ""The government's amendment is simply not good enough. ""Theresa May has gone back on her word and offered an amendment that takes the meaning out of the meaningful vote. Parliament cannot - and should not - accept it.""The bill will now returns to the House of Lords early next week, with both the government amendment and Mr Grieve's original amendment expected to be debated. It will then return to the Commons, where a fresh showdown is expected unless a deal is hammered out. Mr Grieve said the plan now ""has got to be to try to put it right"".The UK is due to leave the EU in March 2019, and negotiations have been taking place on the terms of the separation and how the two sides will work together in the future.The government is trying to pass a new law, called the EU Withdrawal Bill, which it says is needed to ensure a ""smooth and orderly Brexit"".Its main purposes are to end the supremacy of EU law in the UK, and transfer existing EU law into UK law so the same rules and regulations apply on the day after Brexit.But as it passes through Parliament, MPs and peers have been trying to change it, in some cases adding bits on that would change the government's Brexit strategy.These include moves to give Parliament more of a say in the event that it votes to reject the deal stuck between the UK and the EU, or if no deal is reached at all.Ministers say they cannot allow MPs to decide what happens next in these circumstances as it would bind their hands in negotiations.But supporters of the move say it would enable Parliament to avoid an economically damaging outcome for the UK.After the House of Lords changed the bill to give Parliament a more decisive say, MPs voted on Tuesday to reverse the move - but several pro-EU Tories say they held back from voting against the government because of promises they were made that their concerns would be listened to.In the House of Commons on Thursday morning, Labour's Brexit spokesman Sir Keir Starmer pressed Brexit Secretary David Davis on seemingly conflicting accounts of what the would-be rebels were offered.Mr Davis would not be drawn on the details, saying the proposal would meet three criteria: that it does not overturn the referendum result, does not undermine negotiations and does not change the country's constitutional structure which involves the government negotiating."

She was picked as the party's candidate from a shortlist of black and ethnic minority women.A total of 21,979 people turned out to vote in the by-election - 33.2% of the electorate.There was a 19% swing from Labour to the Lib Dems, who saw a 20% increase in their vote share from the last election. Labour won the south-east London seat at the 2017 general election with 32,072 votes - a majority of more than 20,000. Turnout in 2017 was 69%.Their new majority is 5,629.The former Labour MP Heidi Alexander announced in May she was quitting Parliament to work for Mayor of London Sadiq Khan.The full results in Lewisham East were:"

""Sadly, we fell out over that week when Jeremy went into the second leadership election, and I've not spoken to him since that week."" Unite is Labour's largest and most powerful trade union affiliate and biggest donor.Mr Watson, who was elected deputy leader of the party at the same time Mr Corbyn became leader in September 2015, is thought to have come under pressure to denounce Labour MPs who had backed a vote of no confidence in Mr Corbyn.""I felt very difficult there, because Unite funded my campaign, they didn't nominate me, and I think he felt that I, in some way, was obligated to him personally. ""And my obligation was to the Labour Party. You may severely criticise me for taking the wrong position, and that's fair, but I'm not going to be bullied by Len McCluskey. ""I certainly wasn't going to be bullied by Rupert Murdoch, so I'm definitely not going to be bullied by Len McCluskey. And I think he found that very difficult."" The MP, who fought a long-running battle with Mr Murdoch's newspaper group over phone hacking, said he felt he was being persecuted by Mr McCluskey. ""Yes, he is coming for me. They're upping their delegates and all of that,"" he said. ""What will be, will be. He's powerful enough, if he wants to take me out as deputy leader, he probably could, but that's up to him. I'm just going to get on and try and bring everyone back together and do what I can as best I can.""There is no formal mechanism for removing the Labour Party deputy leader.But Mr Watson is understood to be concerned that Unite is engaged in a takeover of the party, with the appointment of Unite officials to key roles, such as new general secretary Jennie Formby and Mr McCluskey's chief of staff, Andrew Murray, who has been seconded to the leader's office.Karie Murphy, who was Unite's favoured candidate in the 2013 selection row ahead of the Falkirk by-election, is Mr Corbyn's chief of staff, while Amy Jackson, a former Unite official, is his political secretary.Mr Watson has also clashed with Mr McCluskey over the union leader's support for the pro-Corbyn pressure group Momentum and efforts by local party activists to de-select some Labour MPs.Mr McCluskey has spoken of his sadness at the demise of his friendship with Mr Watson, but has also accused him of taking part in ""a stupid and rather sinister coup"" to get rid of Mr Corbyn.In September last year, he called for a female deputy leader to be brought in to work alongside Mr Watson.

2018-06-14,NHS groups welcome immigration change,https://web.archive.org//web/20180615032621/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44477095,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowNHS groups have welcomed the decision to relax immigration rules to allow more doctors and nurses from outside the EU into the UK. The Home Office said foreign medics would be excluded from the government's cap on skilled migration.NHS bosses said it would be a ""huge relief"" to health trusts while Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said it was ""extremely welcome"".The cap sets the limit for all non-EU skilled workers at 20,700 a year.It was introduced by Theresa May when she was home secretary but has prompted warnings it makes it hard to fill vacancies in the NHS.Labour described the move as a ""welcome U-turn"" while the Royal College of GPs said it was a ""great step forward"".But an immigration pressure group said the UK should train its own medics and not ""raid other countries"".So-called Tier 2 visas are used by employers to bring skilled workers to the UK from outside the European Economic Area and Switzerland.Since 2011, there has been a cap on the number of these visas that can be issued. Until December 2017, it had only been exceeded once, in June 2015, but recently it has been hit for several months in a row.The government said this was mostly driven by demand for NHS workers which make up 40% of all Tier 2 places.On Tuesday, it was reported by the Financial Times that 2,360 visa applications by doctors from outside the European Economic Area were refused in a five-month period, apparently because of the cap.And in April, NHS bosses warned that immigration rules were hampering their ability to find workers after visas for 100 Indian doctors were refused. NHS England had 35,000 nurse vacancies and nearly 10,000 doctor posts unfilled in February, according to an NHS Improvement report.According to think tank Global Future, 12.5% of NHS England's staff are from overseas. That number rises to 45% in certain specialities including paediatric cardiologists and neurosurgeons.The current annual cap on these visas has also led to over 1,000 IT specialists and engineers being denied visas.The proposed change will only apply to doctors and nurses - but the government said it would free up hundreds of visas a month for workers in other industries like IT and teaching.More details are to be set out on Friday.Dr Sandeep Kumar contacted the BBC to describe how he had been affected by the cap.""My wife and I are Indian Citizens. We currently work at the University Hospital in Kerry in Ireland. We both want to be GPs in the UK and after multiple exams we were able to secure training posts at a hospital in Blackpool due to start in August.""The hospital in Kerry offered to extend our visas so we could continue in our current posts. We said no thank you, we have got our dream job in the UK. They therefore filled our posts.""Then a month ago I had my visa application rejected because of the cap. My wife is still waiting on hers.""Our visas in Ireland expire in August. We have a five month old daughter. We have been out of India for three years and no permanent place to go in India. ""I was delighted when I heard the news the cap was to be lifted but I need to know when it will be. We need something immediately. I think it is good to have some immigration controls but if there are skilled areas where there is a shortage then there shouldn't be a cap.""The NHS needs doctors and we want to come to work there. It is the British public who will suffer in the end if there are staff shortages.""Home Secretary Sajid Javid, who recently suggested a rethink of several key parts of the government's immigration policy, said: ""I recognise the pressures faced by the NHS and other sectors in recent months. Doctors and nurses play a vital role in society and at this time we need more in the UK. That is why I have reviewed our skilled worker visa route.""BBC political correspondent Ben Wright said the announcement could also encourage others to argue for the net migration target of under 100,000 - which has never been met - to be abandoned.Saffron Cordery, of trade body NHS Providers, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the change was ""absolutely the right decision"".""This is going to be a huge relief for trusts up and down the country who have been really struggling to fill their doctors and nurses vacancies,"" she said.The Royal College of GPs said the cap had been ""arbitrary, unhelpful and in fact quite destructive"" and described excluding medics from it as a ""great step forward"".Alp Mehmet, of pressure group Migration Watch, said he accepted the change but that it should not be the long-term solution.""What we must not forget to do is train our own medical staff,"" he said, adding that the UK should not ""raid other countries that need doctors and nurses a great deal more than we do"".Speaking at the NHS Confederation's annual conference in Manchester, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said training places for doctors, nurses and midwives were up by 25%. But he added: ""In the period between now and when those training places convert into fully trained clinicians, the government should be flexible on visas. And that is why it is extremely welcome that today the prime minister has announced that doctors and nurses will be removed from the tier 2 visa caps."" UK government policy aims to reduce net migration to below 100,000 a year.""Perhaps this is a sign that Sajid Javid is willing to take a bolder and more flexible approach to immigration, and deliver the kind of system that Britain will need after we leave the EU,"" said Sunder Katwala, director of the immigration think-tank British Future.""It never made sense to turn away doctors and nurses that the NHS needs.""Are you a doctor or nurse who had their visa application to the UK refused due to the cap?

Ian Blackford led a walk-out of his MPs during Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday over the government's handling of the Brexit bill. Opponents branded the move a ""pre-prepared stunt"" aimed only at furthering the cause of independence.Mr Blackford said it was ""not the end of the matter, it is the beginning"".The walk-out came after Speaker John Bercow expelled Mr Blackford from the chamber when the MP refused to sit down after asking for the Commons to sit in private.SNP MPs were furious after amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill affecting Scotland were passed after less than 20 minutes of debate the previous evening, with the only speech being from Cabinet Office minister David Lidington.Mr Bercow has now granted the party an urgent debate on Brexit and devolution in the Commons, which will be held on Monday and last up to three hours.Holyrood had previously refused to grant formal consent to the bill, with Labour, Green and Lib Dem MSPs uniting with the SNP to outvote the Conservatives.The opposition centres on the bill ""temporarily"" constraining Holyrood's ability to use 24 powers that return from Brussels for up to seven years.The UK government, which reached an agreement with the Welsh government over the issue, says this will ensure the same rules and regulations remain in place across the UK in areas such as agriculture and food labelling.The remainder of the 153 returning powers will go straight to the Scottish Parliament, however.Speaking in the Scottish Parliament, Nicola Sturgeon argued that this week's events had been ""the most clear and powerful evidence so far that the Westminster system simply does not work for Scotland"".The first minister also repeated her claim that the Tories had ""ripped up the convention that has underpinned devolution for nigh on 20 years"" and predicted the party would pay a ""heavy price"". The UK government has signalled that it wants to continue working with its opponents towards finding a resolution to the long-running row.In a statement to MPs on Thursday afternoon, Scottish Secretary David Mundell said the powers at the centre of the row had been ""handed to the European Union through our membership in 1972, long before devolution existed in Scotland"".They had therefore never been under the control of Holyrood, and it was wrong to argue that the powers had been ""taken away"" from the Scottish Parliament, he added.Mr Mundell, who faced calls to resign from opposition parties, said the government would press on with its Brexit plans despite the lack of Holyrood consent, but insisted its aim was still for agreement to be reached between the two sides.He added: ""The Scottish government's position from the outset was that they would be content with nothing less than a veto. However, such an unreasonable position would fundamentally undermine the integrity of the UK internal market.""We on this side of the house have compromised, we have made every effort to reach agreement. We have sought consent.""Now, we are legislating in line with the Sewel Convention to ensure the whole of the United Kingdom leaves the EU with as much legal certainty as possible. That's what people and businesses in Scotland need.""The Sewel Convention states that the UK Parliament has the authority to legislate on any issue, whether devolved or not, but will ""not normally"" do so in devolved areas without the consent of the Scottish Parliament.But Mr Mundell said: ""I think anyone would accept the UK leaving the EU are not normal circumstances.""Speaking to the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme earlier on Thursday, Mr Blackford said the SNP and Scottish government would mount a ""very robust defence of our parliamentary democracy, our parliamentary sovereignty and the rights of the Scottish people"".He insisted Wednesday's walk-out, which was backed by Ms Sturgeon, ""certainly hadn't been a stunt"" and that the UK was now in the midst of a ""constitutional crisis"". And he warned that a failure by the UK government to ""think again"" on the Brexit bill and its impact on the devolution settlement would see the SNP ""take whatever action is necessary"".Mr Blackford added: ""I will make sure that we can frustrate as much as we possibly can what the government are doing.""We will remain civil, we will remain polite, we will remain courteous. But they need to understand that a line has now been crossed - the Conservatives are enacting legislation without the support of the Scottish Parliament.""We are now in different territory.""Mr Blackford hinted that his party would next target the government's Trade Bill, which aims to ensure the UK can continue its existing trade policy as far as possible immediately after Brexit.Scottish Labour MP Paul Sweeney also criticised Mr Mundell, asking: ""If there is no agreement between the Scottish and UK governments, will he resign?""Mr Sweeney also said it was clear that neither side had genuinely wanted to reach an agreement, and called for cross-party talks to resolve the dispute. He added: ""We have seen childish antics from the Tories when it comes to the programme motion, and we have seen childish antics from the SNP yesterday.""The people of Scotland deserve better and they simply want this mess fixed by the politicians that they sent here to stand up for them before this shambles ends up in court.""Mr Mundell said his only regret was to see the ""once proud"" Scottish Labour Party move on to ""nationalist territory"" in backing the SNP over the consent row."

""While production of this so-called delicacy, which is similar to pate, has been banned in Britain since 2000, the fact that imports of it to the UK are allowed means that the suffering and mistreatment of animals continues. ""Our country, which imports about 180 to 200 tonnes of foie gras from mainland Europe each year, sadly continues to play a part in this cruel trade.""Labour MP Kerry McCarthy said foie gras was ""a product of making the animal diseased"" and most people would support an import ban if they knew the ""immense cruelty involved and if people realised that they were eating a diseased organ"".Foie gras factsFrench law states that foie gras ""belongs to the protected cultural and gastronomical heritage of France"", Farming Minister George Eustice told MPs.  ""While we are a member of the European Union, as [Mr Smith] pointed out, we are required to observe law which places restrictions on the introduction of measures that impair the movement of goods within the EU market.""But, he said: ""When we leave the European Union, we do indeed have an opportunity to look at restrictions on sales along the lines that [Mr Smith] pointed out.""Mr Eustice added there were no barriers to an ""ethical ban"" on imports under World Trade Organisation rules, and some countries, such as India, had brought one in."

The free movement of people also applies in the zone as it does in the EU.Supporters of the EEA argue it would give the UK the closest possible relationship with the EU without actually being a member, as it would offer full access to the single market.But critics say it would require the UK to adhere to EU rules without having a say in them - and would not be in keeping with the spirit of the 2016 referendum result.After the House of Lords altered the government's EU Withdrawal Bill in favour of EEA membership, the House of Commons agreed to change it back on Wednesday evening.The government won the vote comfortably after Labour abstained, although three Tory MPs, Ken Clarke, Anna Soubry and Dominic Grieve, rebelled themselves and backed the motion.Please upgrade your browserJeremy Corbyn said EEA membership was ""not the right option"" for Britain but that he understood the difficulties the issue posed for MPs representing strongly Leave or Remain constituencies.Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Labour MP Laura Smith defended her decision to quit as shadow defence minister because she did not want to follow the leader's instruction to abstain.The MP for Crewe and Nantwich said she wanted to oppose the Lords amendment, saying remaining part of the EEA was not in the interests of her constituents who had voted to leave the EU in 2016.Ms Smith, who backed Remain in the referendum, said there were ""legitimate reasons"" why people had backed Brexit, adding: ""The country is divided on this issue and we need to start bringing people together.""On the other side of the debate were her Labour colleagues Ged Killen, Tonia Antoniazzi, Anna McMorrin, Ellie Reeves and Rosie Duffield who stepped down as parliamentary private secretaries to support EEA membership.In her resignation letter to Mr Corbyn, Ms Reeves said her Lewisham West and Penge constituency had voted by two to one to stay in the EU and hundreds had contacted her in support of staying part of the EEA. Earlier, Labour failed in an attempt to amend the bill with their own alternative motion to guarantee ""full access"" to European markets after Brexit from outside the EEA. This was defeated by 322 votes to 240..By political editor Laura KuenssbergA wiser head than me - there's dispute over whether it was Mark Twain or Bismarck! - once remarked that laws are like sausages, if you respect them it's best not to watch them being made.Well the last 48 hours in Westminster may give weight to that. Farce? Fiasco? Or maybe today in Parliament has been in the best tradition of British pantomime.Or perhaps, this is in fact the completely predictable agony of split political parties, with leaders who struggle to command their troops, just trying to make it through after a huge vote that by its very nature, split the country in two.The government is trying to pass a new law, called the EU Withdrawal Bill, which it says is needed to ensure a ""smooth and orderly Brexit"".Its main purposes are to end the supremacy of EU law in the UK, and transfer existing EU law into UK law so the same rules and regulations apply on the day after Brexit.But as it passes through Parliament, MPs and peers have been trying to change it, in some cases adding bits on that would change the government's Brexit strategy.MPs also overturned other changes made to the bill by the Lords, including a requirement for ministers to set out steps to negotiate a customs union with the EU.The government agreed a compromise with potential Tory rebels earlier this week to work towards a ""customs arrangement"" with the EU. This won the support of the Commons by 325 votes to 298.Other changes insisted upon by the Lords relating to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, principles of EU law to be retained after Brexit and EU environmental principles were also removed.  In response to the votes, Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable accused Labour of conspiring with the Conservatives to ""wave through a hard Brexit"".But ministers did make one significant policy concession - on refugee policy after Brexit.They accepted a proposal by Labour MP Yvette Cooper to widen the terms under which unaccompanied child refugees can be reunited with family members living in the UK. Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The government had already agreed to allow unaccompanied children to claim asylum in the UK if it was deemed to be in their ""best interests"".But, following Ms Cooper's intervention, ministers have agreed to drop a clause stating this could only happen if their family members already in the UK were over 18 years of age. Solicitor General Robert Buckland said ministers had listened ""very carefully"" to the views of MPs from different parties and would amend the bill when it returns to the Lords next week. "

UK ministers have faced two days of Commons votes on the EU (Withdrawal) Bill, overturning Lords amendments.The first minister called on Mrs May to use her government's forthcoming Brexit White Paper to ""come clean on Brexit, to erase the wobbly red lines and to get the country into a proper Brexit-ready position"".Warning of the ""very real possibility of a catastrophic no-deal Brexit"", Mr Jones said UK ministers should ""argue for a dynamic and positive relationship with the [European] Single Market"".The first minister - who plans to step down this year - said Mrs May needed to ""stand up to the hard Brexiteers ... and stand up for a sensible Brexit"".Last week, Mr Jones was critical of ""intense public argument between members of the government"" following reports that Brexit Secretary David Davis had threatened to resign.However, Labour has its own divisions, with dozens of MPs defying leader Jeremy Corbyn to abstain on a measure to keep the UK in the Single Market through membership of the European Economic Area (EEA) - the so-called Norway model. In his speech on Thursday, Mr Jones said the Norway model was ""not perfect"" but allowed for a degree of freedom of movement that ""most people could accept"". He said it was ""probably right"" that most Labour members supported freedom of movement, and claimed there were no big differences between Labour policy in Cardiff and London on Brexit.Please upgrade your browserWelsh Secretary Alun Cairns, on a visit to Cardigan, defended Mrs May's approach to negotiations, and the agreements she had struck in meetings with other EU government leaders.""There's been very often doom and gloom beforehand but each one has been declared a strong success,"" he said.""The prime minister has a strong record in delivering in the interests of the whole UK and in being pragmatic, because it's about getting the right deal for every part of the UK as well as the right deal for Europe."""

As it stands, no deal has been agreed between London and the EU-27 to allow Britain continued participation.Even if this is eventually negotiated, any decision will probably come too late for UK firms to make the kind of bids for satellite work they have in the past.Science minister Sam Gyimah said the vote at an Esa Council meeting to proceed with procurement put at risk Britain's future security relationship with the EU.""The simple fact is that without full, fair and open industrial involvement, Galileo doesn't offer the UK value for money or meet our defence needs, so we would be obliged to walk away, resulting in delays and additional costs to the programme that will run into the billions,"" he said. ""There is an option on the table that would benefit both the UK and EU. If that is not accepted by the EU, we are a proud and confident nation and will be looking at all alternatives."" Ministers have previously talked about the UK building its own sat-nav system, which could cost £3-5bn.The European Commission says Brexit means the UK will have to be excluded from a key element of Galileo after March next year.This is the Public Regulated Service, or PRS - a navigation and timing signal intended for use by government agencies, armed forces and emergency services.The PRS is designed to be available and robust even in times of crisis.Brussels says London cannot immediately have access to it when the UK leaves the European bloc because it will become a foreign entity. PRS is for EU member states only. The UK believes to stay part of Galileo, it must have full access to PRS.Mr Gyimah wrote to the EC's commissioner for space, Elżbieta Bieńkowska, requesting Esa delay its deliberations to give negotiations a chance to succeed. ""To press ahead with the Batch 4 vote now could prejudge the outcome of further negotiations which is something I am sure we want to avoid,"" he said in his letter.The European Commission uses the European Space Agency as its technical and design agent on Galileo.So far, Esa has put 22 satellites in orbit for the network and has commissioned others to take the total number above 24 - considered a full system - plus spares. Batch 4, valued at some €400m, would likely acquire 12 additional satellites to act as the rolling replacements for earlier models in orbit that reach the end of their operational lives.To date, British engineers have assembled the payloads - the ""brains"" - of every single Galileo satellite."
2018-06-14,Female MP in 'dilation' row with Bercow,https://web.archive.org//web/20180615032621/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44471407,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowConservative minister Claire Perry has accused John Bercow of making ""sexist"" comments about her after he told her to avoid ""dilation"" in the Commons. She said he had used ""demeaning language"" while chiding her for taking too long to answer questions.Comments ""about me being dilated"" had caused ""surprise and dismay"" among MPs from all sides, she said.A spokeswoman for Mr Bercow said he often used the word in the context of trying to speed up Commons business. The word dilated is commonly associated with childbirth, being the moment when a pregnant woman's cervix opens up sufficiently to allow labour to take place. But dilated can also be used to refer to someone ""speaking or writing at length"" on a subject. The Speaker's conduct has come under scrutiny in recent months amid claims - that he has denied - that he has acted aggressively to members of his staff.Ms Perry has now written to Mr Bercow to ask him to ""consider his behaviour"" in light of comments he made during Tuesday's Department of Business Questions. Urging her to give ""shorter answers"" to questions from backbenchers, he said the Commons had a ""lot to get through"" and that ""dilation is not in order today"". Ms Perry, who has three children, replied: ""The last time I talked about dilation, I was in labour.""In response, Mr Bercow said ""what is required is a brief answer and a brief question - no dilation"".In her letter, Ms Perry said she had become accustomed to the ""occasional irascible outburst"" from the Speaker which, while ""never enjoyable"", she accepted could be considered part of the ""rough and tumble of government"".But she said she took exception to the ""tone and language"" used to ""admonish me for giving over-long answers that seemed both overly aggressive and particularly sexist"".The minister added. ""Your comments about me being dilated have especially caused comment. ""Of course you may have misspoken, hence my attempt to lighten the mood with a reference to the last time I was dilated but this only provoked a further outburst of anger.""She claimed a ""pattern of behaviour"" was emerging which suggested Mr Bercow had a ""woman problem"" and found it ""increasingly hard to interact respectfully with female MPs on the government benches"".A spokeswoman for the Speaker's Office said Mr Bercow meant nothing derogatory in the remark. ""During question time yesterday, the Speaker was trying to move business along ahead of the much-anticipated debate on the EU (Withdrawal) Bill. Most computers will open PDF documents automatically, but you may need Adobe ReaderDownload the reader here""He simply urged the minister to give a 'brief answer … no dilation' - in other words, he was asking Ms Perry not to speak at length. It is a term he has used many times before.""In his own reply to Ms Perry, the Speaker said he did not agree with her assertions but suggested they meet for a cup of tea to ""clear the air"". Mr Bercow, who has been Speaker since 2009, has incurred the wrath of some ministers over the years by telling them to be more concise in the Commons, once cutting off David Cameron half way through an answer and telling him ""take it from me he has finished"". The Speaker came under fire last month amid unconfirmed claims that he had called Commons leader Andrea Leadsom a ""stupid woman"" in the chamber. He admitted using the word stupid as a ""muttered aside"" but only in the context of the government's handling of parliamentary business and insisted that he had every respect for Mrs Leadsom and all his colleagues."

Scotland's first minister says the passage of the UK's key Brexit legislation without the consent of the Scottish Parliament has ""ripped up the 20-year-old devolution convention"" in the UK. Is she right?Ms Sturgeon's tweet came after the House of Commons spent less than 20 minutes debating the EU Withdrawal Bill's impact on devolution. The SNP said that showed ""contempt for Scottish democracy"", with the party's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, leading a walk-out of his MPs during Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday.The row centres on a so-called ""power grab"", with the Scottish government accusing Westminster of keeping some powers for itself that should go to the Scottish Parliament at Holyrood, after Brexit.  The UK government says the ""temporary"" move will allow the same rules and regulations to remain in place across the whole of the UK in 24 key areas, such as agriculture, fisheries and food labelling.And it points out that the vast majority of the 153 areas where policy in devolved areas is currently decided in Brussels will go directly to the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly, meaning both will have considerably more powers after Brexit than they do now. Months of talks have failed to reach a deal - although the Welsh government dropped its opposition after changes were made that would put a limit on how long the UK government would keep the powers.Last month, the Scottish Parliament voted overwhelmingly to refuse consent for the Brexit bill, with the SNP being joined by Labour, the Greens and Liberal Democrat MSPs and only the Conservatives voting against. The UK government pressed on regardless - so how was it able to do so? When the devolved Scottish Parliament was set up in 1999, it was handed control over many policy areas such as health and education that had previously been decided at Westminster.However, an agreement signed by the two governments in 2001 stated that ""the United Kingdom Parliament retains authority to legislate on any issue, whether devolved or not"" and that it was ""ultimately for parliament to decide what use to make of that power"". It also stated that the UK government ""will proceed in accordance with the convention that the UK Parliament would not normally legislate with regard to devolved matters except with the agreement of the devolved legislature"". This agreement was inserted into the Scotland Act in 2016, which was drawn up after the independence referendum two years earlier.The word ""normally"" is, of course, an important caveat that is open to different interpretations - is Brexit ""normal"", for example?Scottish Secretary David Mundell said these were not normal times and a failure to proceed with the bill would jeopardise businesses across the UK.He accused the Scottish government of wanting a veto over arrangements that would apply to the whole of the UK and insisted the UK government ""followed the spirit and letter of the devolution settlement at every stage"" despite the failure to secure consent.  Consent is sought through something known as the Sewel Convention, named after former Labour government minister Lord Sewel, which, in effect, allowed the UK government to ask MSPs for permission to change the law in an area that is devolved to Holyrood. Similar conventions apply in both Wales and Northern Ireland. Until Brexit came along, the Scottish Parliament had only once before refused to give its consent - over some aspects of the Welfare Reform Bill in 2011, which resulted in the Scottish government introducing its own legislation to resolve the row. So Ms Sturgeon is correct to say that pushing through the EU Withdrawal Bill without the consent of the Scottish Parliament means that the long-standing convention has, in effect, been ""ripped up"".However, as its name suggests, it is merely a convention and there is no legal requirement for the UK government to seek Holyrood's permission - or to respect its decision if it says ""no"". This was confirmed by the Supreme Court last year, when it ruled on the case brought by Gina Miller about the triggering of Article 50, which started the Brexit process. Judges ruled that the Sewel Convention was not a legally enforceable rule despite being inserted into the Scotland Act.This meant that the Scottish Parliament did not have a veto over Article 50 or, by extension, the EU Withdrawal Bill. Regardless, ignoring the result of the Scottish Parliament vote was sure to provoke fury from the SNP, with Ms Sturgeon warning that ""the decision to act without our consent, and the manner of doing it, will not be forgotten"".Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questionsFollow us on Twitter"

She was so supportive towards the former attorney general, as he argued for Parliament to have a ""meaningful vote"" on the terms of the Brexit deal, that it seemed probable she would join the Euro-rebels in voting for it….For some time the government Chief Whip Julian Smith had been flitting round the Chamber talking to his troops - then he went and had a word with the Solicitor General, Robert Buckland, the government's in-house legal eagle, who is dealing with the techie legal aspects of the EU (Withdrawal) Bill. Soon after, Mr Buckland intervened on Mr Grieve to suggest talks over a compromise deal. It appeared that the head count had been done, and the concession followed. Most dangerousThe meaningful vote is probably the most dangerous of the Lords amendments to the EU (Withdrawal) Bill - because it tees up an unpredictable vote on the final terms of Brexit, towards the end of this year, and opens up the possibility that MPs could demand that ministers change policy, in the event the terms were rejected by the House, or no deal was reached in the talks with the EU….. they could even demand (drumroll) a second referendum…The government would not have sought a deal if it thought it had the votes to win, and they clearly blinked. The decision to seek a compromise marked an important victory for the soft Brexit/Remainer/""realist"" Tory rebels, who have been promised an amendment giving them most of what they want. As I write the full terms of the deal have yet to be revealed, but there is briefing ministers have conceded that a motion, which could be amended, would be put before MPs, in event a final divorce deal is voted down. In other words, in the event of a divorce deal that the Commons refused to accept, MPs would be able to set a new course for Brexit. This whole idea was denounced by Brexiteers as a Trojan horse for Remainers, and for a second referendum, so that concession could well produce some blowback. But for now, the government seems to have prevented an embarrassing defeat, and the Tory rebels have avoided the unpleasantness of colluding in the defeat of their Prime Minister. One of the leading Tory rebels has told the BBC ""the government has bent not broken"" but it leaves the ""fight for another day"".But ministers now know that a narrow but decisive Commons majority can be assembled against them on critical Brexit issues, and that its next outing could well be on a more substantive vote on a customs union. Will that knowledge mean a softer Brexit strategy will now emerge?"

The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks have now moved on to future relations - after agreement was reached on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree within six months on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide, but first let's go back to the basics...It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.1% in the first three months of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.4%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand near a 40-year year low of 4.2%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 4.2% in the year to March 2018, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May is seeking to put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. If passed, it will end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, is supposed to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each playing roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanAn agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement wopuld only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.The full details are not yet known but UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72.We don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pounds buy fewer euros. A slump in the value of the dollar means the exchange rate with the pound is pretty close to where it was before the referendum.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.The UK has proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.A method for calculating the bill has been agreed, but the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more.The question of how and when payments will be made still needs to resolved, but it will be a schedule lasting for many years to come, and it is highly unlikely that anyone will ever be able to give an exact figure for the size of the divorce bill.UK sources say it will be up to £40bn, but some EU sources expect it to be higher than that. No-one can say for sure, and both sides want to keep it that way.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 6.5% in 2016 to 2.7% in 2017, according to the Halifax. It said the slowdown was driven by a squeeze on real wage growth.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-06-14,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180615032621/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to £840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

As I write, Mrs May is holed up with her advisers inside Tory HQ. But a former minister Anna Soubry has called for her to ""consider her position"" - political code for calling for her to resign. Read more from LauraJohn Curtice, Professor of Politics at the University of StrathclydeThis is the third post-war snap election called unexpectedly before a party's term of office had come to an end.  On the two previous occasions in 1970 and February 1974 the PM and the party lost office. While there is no other conceivable administration in the new parliament other than a Conservative-led one, it remains to be seen whether the PM will retain her position. However, so long as the Conservatives can reach an accommodation with the DUP they will have a working majority in the House of Commons.  BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed:When the general election exit poll was revealed at 10pm, the pound immediately dropped by 2% as investors took a position that a hung parliament was a possible outcome of the general election.Why would that cause the currency to decline? Because a hung parliament means that the government's direction of travel would be less certain.

Sir Christopher's intervention was met with shouts of ""shame"" from other MPs.Ministers have criticised him, with Justice Secretary David Gauke tweeting his disappointment.But his backbench colleagues have gone further - Tory MP Nick Boles tweeted that Sir Christopher was a politician ""whose knuckles dragged along the ground"".And George Freeman, who used to lead Theresa May's policy unit, said the move was ""an affront to parliamentary democracy"".Minister for Women Victoria Atkins said the government will allocate time for the bill in Parliament to ensure it does not get pushed down the list of private members' bills.Sir Christopher has yet to speak out about his intervention, but upskirting victim Gina Martin - who started the campaign for the new law - said he told her he objected ""on principle"" because it ""wasn't debated"".She told the BBC he said he ""wasn't really sure"" what upskirting was. ""I said, 'well, I can help you with that',"" Ms Martin added. Liberal Democrat MP Wera Hobhouse, who brought the private member's bill to Parliament, also  criticised the ""out-of-touch Tory"" for ""sabotaging"" it. She has asked for her bill to return to the House on 6 July. Dawn Butler, Labour's shadow minister for women and equalities, said it was ""absolutely disgusting"" that the bill had been blocked.Justice minister Lucy Frazer said the government was ""committed to making sure upskirting becomes a criminal offence and have every expectation that this will happen"". By Mark D'Arcy, BBC parliamentary correspondentSir Christopher is a leading member of a group of backbench Conservatives who make a practice of ensuring that what they see as well-meaning but flabby legislation is not lazily plopped on to the statute book by a few MPs on a poorly-attended Friday sitting. And - after all - this is a bill to create a new criminal offence, for which people can go to jail. So, however worthy the cause, he insists on proper, extensive scrutiny, and he has spent most Commons Fridays for the last 20 years doing just that. Ms Martin said she remained ""hopeful"" and had arranged a meeting to discuss it with Sir Christopher. She started the campaign to change the law after two men took a picture up her skirt while she was at a concert in London's Hyde Park last July. Police said they were unable to prosecute as the picture was not graphic enough because she was wearing underwear.What is the current law?What are the limitations of the current situation in England and Wales?What does the new law propose?"
2018-06-15,Rebels: Brexit bill offer a slap in face,https://web.archive.org//web/20180616052934/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44482652,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe government's bid to avoid a Commons defeat on the Brexit bill has been rejected as ""slap in the face"" by leading rebel Dominic Grieve.Theresa May assured Mr Grieve ahead of a vote on Tuesday that his call for MPs to be given a greater say on a Brexit deal would be taken on board.But he said ministers had changed the wording of an amendment drawn up after talks with him, at the last minute.Further talks are expected ahead of the bill returning to Parliament next week.Solicitor General Robert Buckland said the government had to ""strike a balance"" between rebels' concerns and protecting the government's negotiating position in Brexit talks with the EU.BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said Remain-leaning Tory MPs were furious and it set the scene for another big showdown when the bill returns to Parliament.Mr Grieve, a former attorney general, told BBC One's Question Time he could not understand why the government amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill had been changed ""at the last minute"" after two days of talks.""I'd actually got on a train. I thought it was all over,"" he said.He said the problem was that if the UK reached ""the really apocalyptic moment"" where no Brexit deal had been done by early February 2019, Parliament was not being offered the chance to say what should happen next - only to ""note"" the position.Later he told BBC Radio 4's The World Tonight: ""I simply don't understand why they have done this ... It does feel, I have to say, to be blunt about it, it seems a bit like a slap in the face.""He added that rebels would ""talk further to the government and try to resolve it"".Ah ha, so just to be clear we are now going to have to amend the ‘unamendable’ after the agreed amendable amendment acquired a sneaky sting in the tail. What a time to be alive...End of Twitter post  by @sarahwollastonFellow backbencher Sarah Wollaston described the change as ""a sneaky sting in the tail"" while Anna Soubry described it as a ""big mistake by the prime minister"" adding: ""Unfortunately it looks like she's yet again caved into the hard Brexiteers."" Another pro-EU Tory MP, Stephen Hammond, suggested the amendment had been ""hijacked"" by government figures trying to ""force their will"" onto the process.Asked if ministers had caved into the demands of Brexiteers and changed the wording, Solicitor General Robert Buckland said: ""No, I'm not getting into some Tory psychodrama about this. ""Colleagues had their say and had an input into the process. No deals were done this was all a process that took several hours, to say the least, to try to produce something that could command support and I'm sorry that some colleagues feel that it doesn't go as far as they had hoped for, I really am.""But we have to make a decision, we have to move forward, table an amendment and allow their lordships to have the vigorous debate that I'm sure will follow next week.""A spokesman for the Department for Exiting the European Union said the amendment addressed a ""hypothetical"" scenario adding: ""The government is confident we will agree a good deal with the EU which Parliament will support.""The bill will now returns to the House of Lords early next week, with both the government amendment and Mr Grieve's original amendment expected to be debated. It will then return to the Commons, where a fresh showdown is expected unless a deal is hammered out. The government's amendment to the EU (Withdrawal) Bill sets out what must happen in the event of three scenarios: If MPs vote down the UK-EU Brexit deal, if Theresa May announces before 21 January 2019 that no deal has been reached, or if 21st January passes with no deal being struck.Under these circumstances, a minister must make a statement in Parliament setting out their next steps and give MPs an opportunity to vote.However, the vote would be on ""a motion in neutral terms"", merely stating that the House has considered the statement.Mr Grieve had originally wanted the amendment to say that the government must seek the approval of Parliament for its course of action - and that ministers must be directed by MPs and peers.Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer said: ""The government's amendment is simply not good enough. ""Theresa May has gone back on her word and offered an amendment that takes the meaning out of the meaningful vote. Parliament cannot - and should not - accept it.""Analysis By BBC political correspondent Ben WrightFormer Attorney General Dominic Grieve, Anna Soubry and perhaps a dozen of their Conservative backbench colleagues are leading the fight to ensure the Commons has the chance to shape the government's next move, if no deal is reached with the EU. That is Labour's view too. But the government is emphatic Parliament should not have that power. Why? Because that would effectively neuter the UK government's threat to the EU, that it is prepared to walk out without a deal. That's why Brexiteers are so enraged by this row. And it's why Dominic Grieve and his parliamentary posse are steeled for a drawn-out fight with their own government. The argument moves back to the Lords on Monday before a likely final showdown in the Commons next Wednesday. A compromise may be brokered before then. But a Conservative source told me the bitterness within the party was now worse than it was during the Maastricht saga in the early 1990s - of which today's battle over Brexit is, perhaps, the final act.The UK is due to leave the EU in March 2019, and negotiations have been taking place on the terms of the separation and how the two sides will work together in the future.The government is trying to pass a new law, called the EU Withdrawal Bill, which it says is needed to ensure a ""smooth and orderly Brexit"".Its main purposes are to end the supremacy of EU law in the UK, and transfer existing EU law into UK law so the same rules and regulations apply on the day after Brexit.But as it passes through Parliament, MPs and peers have been trying to change it, in some cases adding bits on that would change the government's Brexit strategy.Mr Grieve summed up the suspicion on both sides of the Brexit argument: ""One background fear is that actually there are some people who would quite like to just tip the UK out of the EU with no deal at all ... the other one is that people are trying to stop Brexit happening."""

The debate resumes on 6th July, where we hope to see the Bill continue to @UKHouseofLords. Agenda will continue to support its passage and make sure the particular needs of women and girls are recognised.End of Twitter post  by @Agenda_allianceThe 23-year-old, from South Norwood, in London, died in September 2010, days after he fell unconscious while being restrained by 11 Metropolitan Police officers at Bethlem Royal Hospital.The measures aim to better govern the use of force in relation to patients in mental health units - and make those who use force more accountable.It would require police officers to wear body cameras while carrying out restraint unless there are legitimate operational reasons for not doing so.Any non-natural death in a mental health unit would automatically trigger an independent investigation under the plans.Labour MP Steve Reed, who brought forward the legislation in a Private Member's Bill, said it was Mr Lewis's legacy and would prevent anyone else going through what he and his family had been through.Health Minister Jackie Doyle-Price paid tribute to Mr Lewis's family - who were watching the debate from the public gallery - for the ""dignified"" way they have campaigned for justice and for change following his death.She said the bill would bring real change in mental health treatment.Conservative MP Philip Davies spoke for nearly two-and-a-half hours, addressing more than 100 amendments put to the Mental Health Units (Use of Force Bill) at report stage by MPs, including several of his own.The Shipley MP clashed frequently with his own front bench over the need for some of his amendments, at one stage branding ministers ""shameful"" after being told one was ""unnecessary"".Other MPs also voiced their frustration at the length of his speech, which finished after 148 minutes.Mr Davies argued the government should accept changes to improve the state of the proposed legislation.With less than 10 minutes for debate time on the bill's third reading, time ran out during a speech by another Conservative MP, Sir Christopher Chope, who then went on to block another bill, that would have outlawed ""upskirting""."

The Muslim Council of Britain welcomed the ""positive step"" but said it fell short of the full inquiry it wants.Conservative peer Baroness Warsi, who was the first female Muslim cabinet minister, has also called for a full inquiry into alleged Islamophobia in the party. Mr Lewis announced the new measures ""as Muslim families gather today to celebrate Eid al-Fitr, marking the end of Ramadan"".He said it was ""utterly unacceptable"" that anyone should suffer abuse because of their faith, race, gender, sexuality or disability.""That is why I believe discrimination of any kind has no place within the Conservative Party,"" Mr Lewis said.""A single case of abuse is one too many, and since becoming chairman I have taken a zero-tolerance approach.""He said there was already a ""clear and fully transparent process for investigating complaints"" and the party had ""immediately suspended members and launched investigations"" where complaints had been made. ""But we should always be looking to do more to stamp out anti-Muslim abuse or discrimination of any kind""He outlined a series of measures: There have been a series of calls from Muslim groups, including within the party, for the Conservatives to do more to tackle Islamophobia among members. Earlier this month, the chairman of the Conservative Muslim Forum Mohammed Amin said the party was perceived as being ""anti-Muslim"" and had prioritised electoral concerns rather than taking ""decisive action"". Baroness Warsi has urged Prime Minister Theresa May to publicly acknowledge that Islamophobia was a problem in the party and said either an internal inquiry or independent inquiry must be established and its findings published.The Muslim Council of Britain has urged the Tories to launch an independent inquiry. In response to Mr Lewis's statement, a spokesman said: ""We welcome the implicit acknowledgement of at least a small number of the serious challenges facing the party, as well as what seems like a movement away from the 'attack the messenger' approach. ""However, whilst a positive step, the very basic proposals do little to deal with the serious concerns that we - amongst others - have raised."" Nor will they distract the public from the very reasonable calls for a full inquiry."""

The 49-year-old Alyn and Deeside AM was found dead at his home in Connah's Quay, Flintshire, in November 2017.Four days earlier, he had been sacked from the Welsh Government amid allegations he ""touched or groped"" women.A previous inquest heard the provisional cause of death was hanging.On Friday, a pre-inquest hearing at Ruthin's Coroner's Court found Mr Sargeant had been taking anti-depressants at the time of his death.The solicitor representing Mr Sargeant's family said Mr Jones must have been fully aware of his personal issues as they had been friends for 16 years. But Mr Jones's solicitors disagreed with this claim. The hearing was told the first minister did not believe the former communities secretary was suffering from a mental health condition or any other vulnerability when he was sacked from the cabinet. Mr Jones was not present but was legally represented at the hearing as he is being treated as an interested party. Mr Sargeant's son Jack, who replaced his father as Alyn and Deeside AM after his death, attended the hearing.The coroner for north Wales east and central John Gittins is hearing arguments as to whether the inquest should be broader in scope and examine the wider circumstances around Mr Sargeant's death."

Campaigners have warned addiction to FOBTS is having a devastating effect on people in some of the poorest communities.A government spokesman said it was ""committed to making sure that vulnerable people are protected"".""But we also need to consider the thousands of people that are employed in the sector, so we are taking time to work with industry to ensure that there is enough time to implement all of the changes,"" he added.He said the changes to FOBTs needed to be made through secondary legislation ""so we need to make sure there is enough time for that process to take place.""When the government announced it was cutting the stake, it said the new limit would come into effect some time next year, but would not set an exact timetable.At the time bookmakers warned the stake reduction could lead to thousands of outlets closing.FOBTs generate £1.8bn in revenue a year for the betting industry, according to the Gambling Commission, and taxes of £400m for the government."

""Sadly, we fell out over that week when Jeremy went into the second leadership election, and I've not spoken to him since that week."" Unite is Labour's largest and most powerful trade union affiliate and biggest donor.Mr Watson, who was elected deputy leader of the party at the same time Mr Corbyn became leader in September 2015, is thought to have come under pressure to denounce Labour MPs who had backed a vote of no confidence in Mr Corbyn.""I felt very difficult there, because Unite funded my campaign, they didn't nominate me, and I think he felt that I, in some way, was obligated to him personally. ""And my obligation was to the Labour Party. You may severely criticise me for taking the wrong position, and that's fair, but I'm not going to be bullied by Len McCluskey. ""I certainly wasn't going to be bullied by Rupert Murdoch, so I'm definitely not going to be bullied by Len McCluskey. And I think he found that very difficult."" The MP, who fought a long-running battle with Mr Murdoch's newspaper group over phone hacking, said he felt he was being persecuted by Mr McCluskey. ""Yes, he is coming for me. They're upping their delegates and all of that,"" he said. ""What will be, will be. He's powerful enough, if he wants to take me out as deputy leader, he probably could, but that's up to him. I'm just going to get on and try and bring everyone back together and do what I can as best I can.""There is no formal mechanism for removing the Labour Party deputy leader.But Mr Watson is understood to be concerned that Unite is engaged in a takeover of the party, with the appointment of Unite officials to key roles, such as new general secretary Jennie Formby and Mr McCluskey's chief of staff, Andrew Murray, who has been seconded to the leader's office.Karie Murphy, who was Unite's favoured candidate in the 2013 selection row ahead of the Falkirk by-election, is Mr Corbyn's chief of staff, while Amy Jackson, a former Unite official, is his political secretary.Mr Watson has also clashed with Mr McCluskey over the union leader's support for the pro-Corbyn pressure group Momentum and efforts by local party activists to de-select some Labour MPs.Mr McCluskey has spoken of his sadness at the demise of his friendship with Mr Watson, but has also accused him of taking part in ""a stupid and rather sinister coup"" to get rid of Mr Corbyn.In September last year, he called for a female deputy leader to be brought in to work alongside Mr Watson.

2018-06-15,Timetable row rail boss resigns,https://web.archive.org//web/20180616052934/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-44497080,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe boss of beleaguered rail firm Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) is to resign.Passengers have faced major disruption as hundreds of trains were cancelled following the introduction of new timetables in May.GTR, which runs Thameslink, Southern and Great Northern, said chief executive Charles Horton would remain in post for a short time to oversee the development of a temporary timetable.The RMT said: ""The rotten franchise he was steering remains in place.""Announcing his resignation, Mr Horton said: ""I recognise that passengers have been hugely frustrated at the significant disruption caused by the introduction of new timetables.""It is the right time to hand leadership of GTR to a new pair of hands.""GTR - Britain's largest rail franchise - changed the time of every train on its timetable on 20 May.Passengers were warned of disruption before the changes were brought in, but the implementation of the new timetable saw some services withdrawn and further cancellations without any warning.The changes affected the Southern rail, Gatwick Express, Thameslink and Great Northern networks.About 230 daily services were removed from GTR's routes to make for a ""more consistent timetable"", the company said.Last week, it emerged the firm was using taxis to make sure students could get to exams on time.And Mr Horton - who will be grilled by the Commons Transport Select Committee on Monday alongside other rail bosses -  admitted being delayed by his own trains.In a letter to staff, he said: ""In my view, this was an industry-wide failure of the timetabling process. But with leadership comes responsibility and so I feel it is only right that I step down.""Before my departure in a few weeks' time, I will continue to work with my colleagues to ensure a smooth handover as we work to put our railway back on track and give our passengers a reliable service once again.""RMT general secretary Mick Cash said: ""Mr Horton may now have gone but the rotten franchise he was steering remains in place and no change at the top will alter that.""This whole basket-case operation is a failure on every level.""Charles Horton has been chief executive of Govia Thameslink Railway since September 2014, having previously been managing director of Southeastern.He started his career in transport at the London Underground in 1985, rising to station services director. Mr Horton moved to Connex South Eastern in 2000. He then became managing director of Southern Railway from 2003 to 2006, when he moved to Southeastern.AnalysisBy Tom Edwards, BBC London Transport CorrespondentThe timetable launch was meant to be a new dawn for commuters of new, faster trains and more destinations.Instead it has been a total shambles and descended into cancellations, delays and commuter fury. And now the debacle has claimed its first victim, Charles Horton. He has been resilient - even last week he told me he'd stay and sort the mess out - and he withstood pressure during extremely disruptive Southern strikes over guards' roles on trains.But this timetable launch has been so disastrous he has fallen on his sword.Industry sources say it doesn't mean he takes full responsibility - the timetable is an industry-wide issue. It will all now be subject to an independent review.The bad news for the nearly half-a-million commuters on the mega-franchise is this will not resolve cancellations and delays in the short-term.There is a shortage of ""route-trained"" drivers for London's central tunnelled section, which could take months to resolve .Emily Ketchin, founder of campaign group Harpenden Thameslink Commuters, said: ""The so-called timetable that Thameslink is running today is more like a lottery.""Customers need to see leadership and a rapid improvement to correct the errors that Mr Horton is leaving behind.""Anthony Smith, chief executive of passenger watchdog Transport Focus, said: ""Passengers will probably welcome a fresh start and this recognition of the problems.""A Department for Transport spokesman said: ""Clearly the disruption that passengers have experienced following the recent timetabling changes has been unacceptable and it is right that the industry takes responsibility for its performance.""We will continue to work closely with GTR's leadership to deliver improved services for passengers. Meanwhile, an independent inquiry will get to the bottom of what happened and make sure this does not happen again.""Bedford commuters said Thameslink services were ""destroying lives"".Katy Marshall said trains were dangerously overcrowded, and Ellie Jones said people were left standing and ""falling into each other"" on trains, with nothing to hold on to.Dawn Sawyer-Sheppard said: ""We cannot continue like this, it's destroying lives, jobs and towns.""Another commuter, Fabrizio Garguulo, described Thameslink as a ""poor excuse for a train service"".Louisa Branson said: ""I think that the mental health impact on all commuters is a ticking bomb. People are trying to be kind and decent to each other but after long busy days in the city, patience with one another is wearing very thin on the routes home.""I for one struggle with being so up close and personal with my fellow sufferers.""AA president and Thameslink season ticket holder Edmund King said it had gone beyond a joke, adding: ""If this sorry performance continues, more passengers will give up on the railways and take to the congested roads."""
2018-06-15,Universal Credit 'not value for money',https://web.archive.org//web/20180616052934/https://www.bbc.com/news/education-44468437,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe government's flagship benefits system has been too slow to roll out, causes hardship, and is not delivering value for money, a watchdog has said.The National Audit Office said the £1.9bn Universal Credit system could end up costing more to administer than the benefits system it is replacing. Some claimants waited eight months for payment amid the switch to UC, which rolls six benefits into one, it adds.The government said UC would bring a £34bn return over 10 years.It said more people would get into work - and stay there longer - and that it had taken a ""listen and learn"" approach to the introduction of the programme.The move to UC has long been criticised for its delayed and flawed implementation, with about 25% (113,000) of new claims in 2017 being paid late.Sherry Fuller was made redundant last year after working in local government for 17 years and she started on UC one month ago.She says without the help of friends and family she would be homeless as the payment doesn't cover her essential costs.""It's a horrible place to be. Very often you are getting so little money that you are having to rely on food banks, having to rely on the goodwill of those around you.""Helen Stephens, from Manchester, also had to borrow from friends and family after waiting over two months for a UC payment and says that badly affected her mental health.She said: ""This drove me to depression as I had never needed anything like that in the past. I felt helpless and worthless.""It would appear to me that Universal Credit is designed to be very difficult and give people as little as possible.""Meg Hillier, chairwoman of the Public Accounts Committee, said UC had been ""one long catalogue of delay with huge impact on people's lives"".And the Child Poverty Action Group questioned whether the government should push on with a programme that was ""demonstrably failing"".Key findings in the National Audit Office included:The report noted that ""the Department for Work and Pensions does not accept that UC has caused hardship among claimants"".It pointed to a recent internal departmental report that showed 40% of claimants were experiencing financial difficulties.Analysis of DWP payment data for 2017 revealed late payments were delayed on average by four weeks, but from January to October 2017, 40% of those affected by late payments waited a total of about 11 weeks or more. Some 20% of this group waited almost five months and about 8% had to wait for eight months.Despite recent improvements, one-fifth of new claimants in March 2018 did not receive their full entitlement on time. Some 13% received no payment on time. Universal Credit merges six benefits (income support; income-based jobseeker's allowance; income-related employment and support allowance; housing benefit; child tax credit; working tax credit) into one.It was designed to make claiming benefits simpler. A single payment is paid directly into claimants' bank accounts to cover whichever benefits they are eligible for.Claimants then have to pay costs, such as rent, out of their UC payment. It can be claimed by people whether they are in or out of work - but payment decreases as you earn more.A spokesman for the DWP insisted UC was good value and would realise a return on investment of £34bn over 10 years against a cost of £2bn - with 200,000 more people in work.  ""Furthermore, 83% of claimants are satisfied with the service and the majority agree that it 'financially motivates' them to work,"" he said.Work and pensions minister Alok Sharma said the NAO report was written before the introduction of £1.5bn-worth of measures enabling people to get 100% advances on their first UC payment. Mr Sharma told the Today programme those on housing benefit could also get extra money to help them transition on to UC.""We've not seen the full impact of these very positive changes,"" he added.But Jane Ahrends, of the Child Poverty Action Group, said the NAO presented a ""justifiably bleak"" picture, urging ministers to ""pause for thought"". ""Will the government press on with a programme that is demonstrably failing - causing financial misery for families - or will it restore the money that's been taken out of Universal Credit in an effort to rehabilitate it for struggling families.""Emma Revie, chief executive of food bank charity The Trussell Trust, called for more support for ""groups of people most likely to need a food bank, and debt advice to be offered to everyone moving on to the new system"".  Shadow work and pensions secretary Margaret Greenwood said: ""This report shows just how disastrously wrong the Conservatives have got the roll out of Universal Credit."""

""While production of this so-called delicacy, which is similar to pate, has been banned in Britain since 2000, the fact that imports of it to the UK are allowed means that the suffering and mistreatment of animals continues. ""Our country, which imports about 180 to 200 tonnes of foie gras from mainland Europe each year, sadly continues to play a part in this cruel trade.""Labour MP Kerry McCarthy said foie gras was ""a product of making the animal diseased"" and most people would support an import ban if they knew the ""immense cruelty involved and if people realised that they were eating a diseased organ"".Foie gras factsFrench law states that foie gras ""belongs to the protected cultural and gastronomical heritage of France"", Farming Minister George Eustice told MPs.  ""While we are a member of the European Union, as [Mr Smith] pointed out, we are required to observe law which places restrictions on the introduction of measures that impair the movement of goods within the EU market.""But, he said: ""When we leave the European Union, we do indeed have an opportunity to look at restrictions on sales along the lines that [Mr Smith] pointed out.""Mr Eustice added there were no barriers to an ""ethical ban"" on imports under World Trade Organisation rules, and some countries, such as India, had brought one in."

Scotland's first minister says the passage of the UK's key Brexit legislation without the consent of the Scottish Parliament has ""ripped up the 20-year-old devolution convention"" in the UK. Is she right?Ms Sturgeon's tweet came after the House of Commons spent less than 20 minutes debating the EU Withdrawal Bill's impact on devolution. The SNP said that showed ""contempt for Scottish democracy"", with the party's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, leading a walk-out of his MPs during Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday.The row centres on a so-called ""power grab"", with the Scottish government accusing Westminster of keeping some powers for itself that should go to the Scottish Parliament at Holyrood, after Brexit.  The UK government says the ""temporary"" move will allow the same rules and regulations to remain in place across the whole of the UK in 24 key areas, such as agriculture, fisheries and food labelling.And it points out that the vast majority of the 153 areas where policy in devolved areas is currently decided in Brussels will go directly to the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly, meaning both will have considerably more powers after Brexit than they do now. Months of talks have failed to reach a deal - although the Welsh government dropped its opposition after changes were made that would put a limit on how long the UK government would keep the powers.Last month, the Scottish Parliament voted overwhelmingly to refuse consent for the Brexit bill, with the SNP being joined by Labour, the Greens and Liberal Democrat MSPs and only the Conservatives voting against. The UK government pressed on regardless - so how was it able to do so? When the devolved Scottish Parliament was set up in 1999, it was handed control over many policy areas such as health and education that had previously been decided at Westminster.However, an agreement signed by the two governments in 2001 stated that ""the United Kingdom Parliament retains authority to legislate on any issue, whether devolved or not"" and that it was ""ultimately for parliament to decide what use to make of that power"". It also stated that the UK government ""will proceed in accordance with the convention that the UK Parliament would not normally legislate with regard to devolved matters except with the agreement of the devolved legislature"". This agreement was inserted into the Scotland Act in 2016, which was drawn up after the independence referendum two years earlier.The word ""normally"" is, of course, an important caveat that is open to different interpretations - is Brexit ""normal"", for example?Scottish Secretary David Mundell said these were not normal times and a failure to proceed with the bill would jeopardise businesses across the UK.He accused the Scottish government of wanting a veto over arrangements that would apply to the whole of the UK and insisted the UK government ""followed the spirit and letter of the devolution settlement at every stage"" despite the failure to secure consent.  Consent is sought through something known as the Sewel Convention, named after former Labour government minister Lord Sewel, which, in effect, allowed the UK government to ask MSPs for permission to change the law in an area that is devolved to Holyrood. Similar conventions apply in both Wales and Northern Ireland. Until Brexit came along, the Scottish Parliament had only once before refused to give its consent - over some aspects of the Welfare Reform Bill in 2011, which resulted in the Scottish government introducing its own legislation to resolve the row. So Ms Sturgeon is correct to say that pushing through the EU Withdrawal Bill without the consent of the Scottish Parliament means that the long-standing convention has, in effect, been ""ripped up"".However, as its name suggests, it is merely a convention and there is no legal requirement for the UK government to seek Holyrood's permission - or to respect its decision if it says ""no"". This was confirmed by the Supreme Court last year, when it ruled on the case brought by Gina Miller about the triggering of Article 50, which started the Brexit process. Judges ruled that the Sewel Convention was not a legally enforceable rule despite being inserted into the Scotland Act.This meant that the Scottish Parliament did not have a veto over Article 50 or, by extension, the EU Withdrawal Bill. Regardless, ignoring the result of the Scottish Parliament vote was sure to provoke fury from the SNP, with Ms Sturgeon warning that ""the decision to act without our consent, and the manner of doing it, will not be forgotten"".Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questionsFollow us on Twitter"
2018-06-15,A fifty-year building safety problem,https://web.archive.org//web/20180616052934/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44498608,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAt approximately 5:45am on Thursday 16th May 1968, Ivy Hodge lit a match. A duff connection between the gas main and her cooker, however, had allowed gas to leak into the kitchen. The cloud exploded, throwing her to the floor. She was knocked out and received some minor burns. And when she came to, found a large portion of the 22-storey high rise in which she lived had collapsed. The Ronan Point disaster took place almost exactly 50 years ago, and there are clear parallels to Grenfell: in both cases, government policy was pointed at one objective but lost sight of building safety. In recent years, energy efficiency was the goal: hundreds of buildings were funded to install insulation on their exterior walls. In 1968, the target was mass-building of new homes.Sir Keith Joseph, as housing minister from 1962 to 1964, had called for a rise in house-building productivity to cope with the postwar baby booms and wartime bombing. Ronan Point was part of the answer to that call: a brand-new tower block, built using modern techniques that required little skilled labour - or even scaffolding. It was one of the new ""Large Panel System"" designs.Hannah Brack, an independent researcher, has uncovered records which show Anthony Greenwood, the housing minister at the time of the collapse, wrote to Prime Minister Harold Wilson on that very day worrying about central government culpability: they had ""pushed"" the design onto local authorities.The explosion was not huge. Miss Hodge survived - so did her oven, which she took to her new home. When estimating the size of the force applied to the wall, the inquiry notes her eardrums did not burst. But, in the words of the official inquiry, the force was enough to blow out ""the external load-bearing flank walls"" of the flat. In short, the blast knocked out the wall supporting the flats above hers. They, in turn, fell down with enough force to destroy the floors beneath hers. It is a miracle that only four people were killed. Had it occurred later in the day, when more people were in their living rooms, it could have been much higher.The panel-built system is a vulnerable design: in short, you took big panels of concrete. Then, with a crane, you stood up some panels to act as walls, then laid others horizontally on top of them to be floors and ceilings. When you had done one floor, you climbed on top of it, and then did the next. The design was simple, but had two terrible problems. First, was the importance of the joints. Load-bearing walls could be knocked out, as at Ronan Point, if the walls and ceilings were not joined effectively. Technical guidance from 1968 on these buildings actually stated: ""One can hardly over-emphasise the absolute necessity of effectively joining  the various components of the structure together in order to obviate any  possible tendency for it to behave like a 'house of cards'""But bolts to hold them together were often missing. Cavities that should have been filled with concrete were found stuffed with rubbish and newspaper. The buildings were built by unskilled workers paid on a piecework basis: in short, they got paid more for working faster.Second, there was a problem with fire. If you have a fire in a flat, the ceiling panel above the fire will heat up faster than the rest. That will mean it expands, and presses the walls outward. That can create large holes in the walls, through which fire, heat and smoke can spread. In extremis, the fire could cause panels to fall out of the wall, and cause collapse. In 1984, Newham ran a test on the then-unoccupied Ronan Point.  They set a fire in a flat to see how serious these issues were - but stopped it, fearing the whole building would fall over.So what happened next? There were lots of buildings built to the same design. They were ordered to be checked and strengthened, and gas supplies were removed from them. The most important response was replacing gas cookers with electric ones.Lots of these buildings survive: Ms Brack has found at least 1,585 of them still standing. There are 200 towers with 20 storeys or more. You can recognise them easily: they should still have no gas fittings, and usually have a sign that tells residents they are banned from bringing calor gas into the building. Lots have also been pulled down. What we have left has been looked after: councils have invested a lot in strengthening works. But during the investigations following Grenfell, boroughs have found major problems with their towers: the Ledbury Estate in Southwark was evacuated.Since then, concerns have been growing in official circles about just what state these towers are in. In August last year, the government asked local authorities to check their large panel system buildings. In Leicester, a tower is being demolished. In Portsmouth, two towers are being emptied to permit strengthening works. In Hammersmith and Fulham, two towers are being reinforced. The government has asked the Buildings Research Establishment - our key laboratory for building safety - to see if it can update its guidance on how to keep these buildings in a safe condition. To assist with that, a tower in London being demolished is going to be inspected as it is taken apart to see if we can learn more about how they were put up and how they have aged.The ministry of housing told Newsnight: ""We continue to monitor these issues through our comprehensive building safety programme and will provide further guidance if that is needed.""But, looking ahead, as they age, the chance of problems rises. Time is not making them better built or rendering the materials stronger. Wind, heat and rain take a toll. Metal bolts rust, expand and cause cracks in the concrete around them (so-called ""concrete cancer"").  So what now?  Central government should think about what comes next. There are strong reasons not to take down buildings precipitously. Local authorities and housing associations have strong financial incentives to keep these buildings in service as long as possible. And to the people inside them, they're homes - homes with big, airy rooms and, for lots of residents, nice views.But these buildings are entering the end of their service lives. The vulnerabilities are growing. Central government may need to work out a plan for decommissioning the surviving LPS towers in an orderly manner. We got 50 years out of buildings that were poorly built to a fundamentally flawed design. We should not push our luck - or wait for it to run out."

She was so supportive towards the former attorney general, as he argued for Parliament to have a ""meaningful vote"" on the terms of the Brexit deal, that it seemed probable she would join the Euro-rebels in voting for it….For some time the government Chief Whip Julian Smith had been flitting round the Chamber talking to his troops - then he went and had a word with the Solicitor General, Robert Buckland, the government's in-house legal eagle, who is dealing with the techie legal aspects of the EU (Withdrawal) Bill. Soon after, Mr Buckland intervened on Mr Grieve to suggest talks over a compromise deal. It appeared that the head count had been done, and the concession followed. Most dangerousThe meaningful vote is probably the most dangerous of the Lords amendments to the EU (Withdrawal) Bill - because it tees up an unpredictable vote on the final terms of Brexit, towards the end of this year, and opens up the possibility that MPs could demand that ministers change policy, in the event the terms were rejected by the House, or no deal was reached in the talks with the EU….. they could even demand (drumroll) a second referendum…The government would not have sought a deal if it thought it had the votes to win, and they clearly blinked. The decision to seek a compromise marked an important victory for the soft Brexit/Remainer/""realist"" Tory rebels, who have been promised an amendment giving them most of what they want. As I write the full terms of the deal have yet to be revealed, but there is briefing ministers have conceded that a motion, which could be amended, would be put before MPs, in event a final divorce deal is voted down. In other words, in the event of a divorce deal that the Commons refused to accept, MPs would be able to set a new course for Brexit. This whole idea was denounced by Brexiteers as a Trojan horse for Remainers, and for a second referendum, so that concession could well produce some blowback. But for now, the government seems to have prevented an embarrassing defeat, and the Tory rebels have avoided the unpleasantness of colluding in the defeat of their Prime Minister. One of the leading Tory rebels has told the BBC ""the government has bent not broken"" but it leaves the ""fight for another day"".But ministers now know that a narrow but decisive Commons majority can be assembled against them on critical Brexit issues, and that its next outing could well be on a more substantive vote on a customs union. Will that knowledge mean a softer Brexit strategy will now emerge?"

The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks have now moved on to future relations - after agreement was reached on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree within six months on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide, but first let's go back to the basics...It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.1% in the first three months of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.4%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand near a 40-year year low of 4.2%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 4.2% in the year to March 2018, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May is seeking to put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. If passed, it will end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, is supposed to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each playing roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanAn agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement wopuld only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.The full details are not yet known but UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72.We don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pounds buy fewer euros. A slump in the value of the dollar means the exchange rate with the pound is pretty close to where it was before the referendum.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.The UK has proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.A method for calculating the bill has been agreed, but the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more.The question of how and when payments will be made still needs to resolved, but it will be a schedule lasting for many years to come, and it is highly unlikely that anyone will ever be able to give an exact figure for the size of the divorce bill.UK sources say it will be up to £40bn, but some EU sources expect it to be higher than that. No-one can say for sure, and both sides want to keep it that way.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 6.5% in 2016 to 2.7% in 2017, according to the Halifax. It said the slowdown was driven by a squeeze on real wage growth.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-06-15,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180616052934/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to £840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

As I write, Mrs May is holed up with her advisers inside Tory HQ. But a former minister Anna Soubry has called for her to ""consider her position"" - political code for calling for her to resign. Read more from LauraJohn Curtice, Professor of Politics at the University of StrathclydeThis is the third post-war snap election called unexpectedly before a party's term of office had come to an end.  On the two previous occasions in 1970 and February 1974 the PM and the party lost office. While there is no other conceivable administration in the new parliament other than a Conservative-led one, it remains to be seen whether the PM will retain her position. However, so long as the Conservatives can reach an accommodation with the DUP they will have a working majority in the House of Commons.  BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed:When the general election exit poll was revealed at 10pm, the pound immediately dropped by 2% as investors took a position that a hung parliament was a possible outcome of the general election.Why would that cause the currency to decline? Because a hung parliament means that the government's direction of travel would be less certain.

Sir Christopher's intervention was met with shouts of ""shame"" from other MPs.Ministers have criticised him, with Justice Secretary David Gauke tweeting his disappointment.But his backbench colleagues have gone further - Tory MP Nick Boles tweeted that Sir Christopher was a politician ""whose knuckles dragged along the ground"".And George Freeman, who used to lead Theresa May's policy unit, said the move was ""an affront to parliamentary democracy"".Minister for Women Victoria Atkins said the government will allocate time for the bill in Parliament to ensure it does not get pushed down the list of private members' bills.Sir Christopher has yet to speak out about his intervention, but upskirting victim Gina Martin - who started the campaign for the new law - said he told her he objected ""on principle"" because it ""wasn't debated"".She told the BBC he said he ""wasn't really sure"" what upskirting was. ""I said, 'well, I can help you with that',"" Ms Martin added. Liberal Democrat MP Wera Hobhouse, who brought the private member's bill to Parliament, also  criticised the ""out-of-touch Tory"" for ""sabotaging"" it. She has asked for her bill to return to the House on 6 July. Dawn Butler, Labour's shadow minister for women and equalities, said it was ""absolutely disgusting"" that the bill had been blocked.Justice minister Lucy Frazer said the government was ""committed to making sure upskirting becomes a criminal offence and have every expectation that this will happen"". By Mark D'Arcy, BBC parliamentary correspondentSir Christopher is a leading member of a group of backbench Conservatives who make a practice of ensuring that what they see as well-meaning but flabby legislation is not lazily plopped on to the statute book by a few MPs on a poorly-attended Friday sitting. And - after all - this is a bill to create a new criminal offence, for which people can go to jail. So, however worthy the cause, he insists on proper, extensive scrutiny, and he has spent most Commons Fridays for the last 20 years doing just that. Ms Martin said she remained ""hopeful"" and had arranged a meeting to discuss it with Sir Christopher. She started the campaign to change the law after two men took a picture up her skirt while she was at a concert in London's Hyde Park last July. Police said they were unable to prosecute as the picture was not graphic enough because she was wearing underwear.What is the current law?What are the limitations of the current situation in England and Wales?What does the new law propose?"
2018-06-16,Rebels: Brexit bill offer a slap in face,https://web.archive.org//web/20180616211700/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44482652,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe government's bid to avoid a Commons defeat on the Brexit bill has been rejected as ""slap in the face"" by leading rebel Dominic Grieve.Theresa May assured Mr Grieve ahead of a vote on Tuesday that his call for MPs to be given a greater say on a Brexit deal would be taken on board.But he said ministers had changed the wording of an amendment drawn up after talks with him, at the last minute.Further talks are expected ahead of the bill returning to Parliament next week.Solicitor General Robert Buckland said the government had to ""strike a balance"" between rebels' concerns and protecting the government's negotiating position in Brexit talks with the EU.BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said Remain-leaning Tory MPs were furious and it set the scene for another big showdown when the bill returns to Parliament.Mr Grieve, a former attorney general, told BBC One's Question Time he could not understand why the government amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill had been changed ""at the last minute"" after two days of talks.""I'd actually got on a train. I thought it was all over,"" he said.He said the problem was that if the UK reached ""the really apocalyptic moment"" where no Brexit deal had been done by early February 2019, Parliament was not being offered the chance to say what should happen next - only to ""note"" the position.Later he told BBC Radio 4's The World Tonight: ""I simply don't understand why they have done this ... It does feel, I have to say, to be blunt about it, it seems a bit like a slap in the face.""He added that rebels would ""talk further to the government and try to resolve it"".Ah ha, so just to be clear we are now going to have to amend the ‘unamendable’ after the agreed amendable amendment acquired a sneaky sting in the tail. What a time to be alive...End of Twitter post  by @sarahwollastonFellow backbencher Sarah Wollaston described the change as ""a sneaky sting in the tail"" while Anna Soubry described it as a ""big mistake by the prime minister"" adding: ""Unfortunately it looks like she's yet again caved into the hard Brexiteers."" Another pro-EU Tory MP, Stephen Hammond, suggested the amendment had been ""hijacked"" by government figures trying to ""force their will"" onto the process.Asked if ministers had caved into the demands of Brexiteers and changed the wording, Solicitor General Robert Buckland said: ""No, I'm not getting into some Tory psychodrama about this. ""Colleagues had their say and had an input into the process. No deals were done this was all a process that took several hours, to say the least, to try to produce something that could command support and I'm sorry that some colleagues feel that it doesn't go as far as they had hoped for, I really am.""But we have to make a decision, we have to move forward, table an amendment and allow their lordships to have the vigorous debate that I'm sure will follow next week.""A spokesman for the Department for Exiting the European Union said the amendment addressed a ""hypothetical"" scenario adding: ""The government is confident we will agree a good deal with the EU which Parliament will support.""The bill will now returns to the House of Lords early next week, with both the government amendment and Mr Grieve's original amendment expected to be debated. It will then return to the Commons, where a fresh showdown is expected unless a deal is hammered out. The government's amendment to the EU (Withdrawal) Bill sets out what must happen in the event of three scenarios: If MPs vote down the UK-EU Brexit deal, if Theresa May announces before 21 January 2019 that no deal has been reached, or if 21st January passes with no deal being struck.Under these circumstances, a minister must make a statement in Parliament setting out their next steps and give MPs an opportunity to vote.However, the vote would be on ""a motion in neutral terms"", merely stating that the House has considered the statement.Mr Grieve had originally wanted the amendment to say that the government must seek the approval of Parliament for its course of action - and that ministers must be directed by MPs and peers.Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer said: ""The government's amendment is simply not good enough. ""Theresa May has gone back on her word and offered an amendment that takes the meaning out of the meaningful vote. Parliament cannot - and should not - accept it.""Analysis By BBC political correspondent Ben WrightFormer Attorney General Dominic Grieve, Anna Soubry and perhaps a dozen of their Conservative backbench colleagues are leading the fight to ensure the Commons has the chance to shape the government's next move, if no deal is reached with the EU. That is Labour's view too. But the government is emphatic Parliament should not have that power. Why? Because that would effectively neuter the UK government's threat to the EU, that it is prepared to walk out without a deal. That's why Brexiteers are so enraged by this row. And it's why Dominic Grieve and his parliamentary posse are steeled for a drawn-out fight with their own government. The argument moves back to the Lords on Monday before a likely final showdown in the Commons next Wednesday. A compromise may be brokered before then. But a Conservative source told me the bitterness within the party was now worse than it was during the Maastricht saga in the early 1990s - of which today's battle over Brexit is, perhaps, the final act.The UK is due to leave the EU in March 2019, and negotiations have been taking place on the terms of the separation and how the two sides will work together in the future.The government is trying to pass a new law, called the EU Withdrawal Bill, which it says is needed to ensure a ""smooth and orderly Brexit"".Its main purposes are to end the supremacy of EU law in the UK, and transfer existing EU law into UK law so the same rules and regulations apply on the day after Brexit.But as it passes through Parliament, MPs and peers have been trying to change it, in some cases adding bits on that would change the government's Brexit strategy.Mr Grieve summed up the suspicion on both sides of the Brexit argument: ""One background fear is that actually there are some people who would quite like to just tip the UK out of the EU with no deal at all ... the other one is that people are trying to stop Brexit happening."""

The debate resumes on 6th July, where we hope to see the Bill continue to @UKHouseofLords. Agenda will continue to support its passage and make sure the particular needs of women and girls are recognised.End of Twitter post  by @Agenda_allianceThe 23-year-old, from South Norwood, in London, died in September 2010, days after he fell unconscious while being restrained by 11 Metropolitan Police officers at Bethlem Royal Hospital.The measures aim to better govern the use of force in relation to patients in mental health units - and make those who use force more accountable.It would require police officers to wear body cameras while carrying out restraint unless there are legitimate operational reasons for not doing so.Any non-natural death in a mental health unit would automatically trigger an independent investigation under the plans.Labour MP Steve Reed, who brought forward the legislation in a Private Member's Bill, said it was Mr Lewis's legacy and would prevent anyone else going through what he and his family had been through.Health Minister Jackie Doyle-Price paid tribute to Mr Lewis's family - who were watching the debate from the public gallery - for the ""dignified"" way they have campaigned for justice and for change following his death.She said the bill would bring real change in mental health treatment.Conservative MP Philip Davies spoke for nearly two-and-a-half hours, addressing more than 100 amendments put to the Mental Health Units (Use of Force Bill) at report stage by MPs, including several of his own.The Shipley MP clashed frequently with his own front bench over the need for some of his amendments, at one stage branding ministers ""shameful"" after being told one was ""unnecessary"".Other MPs also voiced their frustration at the length of his speech, which finished after 148 minutes.Mr Davies argued the government should accept changes to improve the state of the proposed legislation.With less than 10 minutes for debate time on the bill's third reading, time ran out during a speech by another Conservative MP, Sir Christopher Chope, who then went on to block another bill, that would have outlawed ""upskirting""."

The Muslim Council of Britain welcomed the ""positive step"" but said it fell short of the full inquiry it wants.Conservative peer Baroness Warsi, who was the first female Muslim cabinet minister, has also called for a full inquiry into alleged Islamophobia in the party. Mr Lewis announced the new measures ""as Muslim families gather today to celebrate Eid al-Fitr, marking the end of Ramadan"".He said it was ""utterly unacceptable"" that anyone should suffer abuse because of their faith, race, gender, sexuality or disability.""That is why I believe discrimination of any kind has no place within the Conservative Party,"" Mr Lewis said.""A single case of abuse is one too many, and since becoming chairman I have taken a zero-tolerance approach.""He said there was already a ""clear and fully transparent process for investigating complaints"" and the party had ""immediately suspended members and launched investigations"" where complaints had been made. ""But we should always be looking to do more to stamp out anti-Muslim abuse or discrimination of any kind""He outlined a series of measures: There have been a series of calls from Muslim groups, including within the party, for the Conservatives to do more to tackle Islamophobia among members. Earlier this month, the chairman of the Conservative Muslim Forum Mohammed Amin said the party was perceived as being ""anti-Muslim"" and had prioritised electoral concerns rather than taking ""decisive action"". Baroness Warsi has urged Prime Minister Theresa May to publicly acknowledge that Islamophobia was a problem in the party and said either an internal inquiry or independent inquiry must be established and its findings published.The Muslim Council of Britain has urged the Tories to launch an independent inquiry. In response to Mr Lewis's statement, a spokesman said: ""We welcome the implicit acknowledgement of at least a small number of the serious challenges facing the party, as well as what seems like a movement away from the 'attack the messenger' approach. ""However, whilst a positive step, the very basic proposals do little to deal with the serious concerns that we - amongst others - have raised."" Nor will they distract the public from the very reasonable calls for a full inquiry."""

She said: ""An increasing number of women have either come forward or been identified as saying they were subjected to inappropriate behaviour by Mr Sargeant.""It is not clear when the allegations were made or when they date back to. At the time of his sacking Mr Sargeant, who was married and had two children, had vowed to clear his name.But days later he was found dead - a previous inquest gave a provisional cause of death as hanging.The solicitor for Mr Sargeant's family, Leslie Thomas QC, said the allegations were ""unproven"" and Mr Sargeant was not there to defend himself.Coroner John Gittins said he did not think details of the allegations made by women would be relevant to the inquest,The pre-inquest hearing at Ruthin's Coroner's Court on Friday heard Mr Sargeant had been taking anti-depressants at the time of his death.The first minister was not present but has been called to give evidence at the full inquest into his death. Mr Thomas said the first minister must have been fully aware of Mr Sargeant's personal issues when he sacked him, as they had been friends for 16 years. He added there were ""other stressors"" in Mr Sargeant's life and referred to a ""very sensitive issue"" but did not give further details.In a statement the first minister and Welsh Labour leader said he had not been aware of any mental health illness or vulnerabilities at the time.The hearing was told the full inquest into Mr Sargeant's death will also hear evidence from a driver who collected him from the meeting where he was dismissed from his cabinet job as well as another person who was present at the meeting.Mr Sargeant's son Jack, who replaced his father as Alyn and Deeside AM after his death, attended the hearingThe inquest was adjourned to a date to be fixed."

Campaigners have warned addiction to FOBTS is having a devastating effect on people in some of the poorest communities.A government spokesman said it was ""committed to making sure that vulnerable people are protected"".""But we also need to consider the thousands of people that are employed in the sector, so we are taking time to work with industry to ensure that there is enough time to implement all of the changes,"" he added.He said the changes to FOBTs needed to be made through secondary legislation ""so we need to make sure there is enough time for that process to take place.""When the government announced it was cutting the stake, it said the new limit would come into effect some time next year, but would not set an exact timetable.At the time bookmakers warned the stake reduction could lead to thousands of outlets closing.FOBTs generate £1.8bn in revenue a year for the betting industry, according to the Gambling Commission, and taxes of £400m for the government."

""Sadly, we fell out over that week when Jeremy went into the second leadership election, and I've not spoken to him since that week."" Unite is Labour's largest and most powerful trade union affiliate and biggest donor.Mr Watson, who was elected deputy leader of the party at the same time Mr Corbyn became leader in September 2015, is thought to have come under pressure to denounce Labour MPs who had backed a vote of no confidence in Mr Corbyn.""I felt very difficult there, because Unite funded my campaign, they didn't nominate me, and I think he felt that I, in some way, was obligated to him personally. ""And my obligation was to the Labour Party. You may severely criticise me for taking the wrong position, and that's fair, but I'm not going to be bullied by Len McCluskey. ""I certainly wasn't going to be bullied by Rupert Murdoch, so I'm definitely not going to be bullied by Len McCluskey. And I think he found that very difficult."" The MP, who fought a long-running battle with Mr Murdoch's newspaper group over phone hacking, said he felt he was being persecuted by Mr McCluskey. ""Yes, he is coming for me. They're upping their delegates and all of that,"" he said. ""What will be, will be. He's powerful enough, if he wants to take me out as deputy leader, he probably could, but that's up to him. I'm just going to get on and try and bring everyone back together and do what I can as best I can.""There is no formal mechanism for removing the Labour Party deputy leader.But Mr Watson is understood to be concerned that Unite is engaged in a takeover of the party, with the appointment of Unite officials to key roles, such as new general secretary Jennie Formby and Mr McCluskey's chief of staff, Andrew Murray, who has been seconded to the leader's office.Karie Murphy, who was Unite's favoured candidate in the 2013 selection row ahead of the Falkirk by-election, is Mr Corbyn's chief of staff, while Amy Jackson, a former Unite official, is his political secretary.Mr Watson has also clashed with Mr McCluskey over the union leader's support for the pro-Corbyn pressure group Momentum and efforts by local party activists to de-select some Labour MPs.Mr McCluskey has spoken of his sadness at the demise of his friendship with Mr Watson, but has also accused him of taking part in ""a stupid and rather sinister coup"" to get rid of Mr Corbyn.In September last year, he called for a female deputy leader to be brought in to work alongside Mr Watson.

But with leadership comes responsibility and so I feel it is only right that I step down.""Before my departure in a few weeks' time, I will continue to work with my colleagues to ensure a smooth handover as we work to put our railway back on track and give our passengers a reliable service once again.""RMT general secretary Mick Cash said: ""Mr Horton may now have gone but the rotten franchise he was steering remains in place and no change at the top will alter that.""This whole basket-case operation is a failure on every level.""Charles Horton has been chief executive of Govia Thameslink Railway since September 2014, having previously been managing director of Southeastern.He started his career in transport at the London Underground in 1985, rising to station services director. Mr Horton moved to Connex South Eastern in 2000. He then became managing director of Southern Railway from 2003 to 2006, when he moved to Southeastern.AnalysisBy Tom Edwards, BBC London Transport CorrespondentThe timetable launch was meant to be a new dawn for commuters of new, faster trains and more destinations.Instead it has been a total shambles and descended into cancellations, delays and commuter fury. And now the debacle has claimed its first victim, Charles Horton. He has been resilient - even last week he told me he'd stay and sort the mess out - and he withstood pressure during extremely disruptive Southern strikes over guards' roles on trains.But this timetable launch has been so disastrous he has fallen on his sword.Industry sources say it doesn't mean he takes full responsibility - the timetable is an industry-wide issue. It will all now be subject to an independent review.The bad news for the nearly half-a-million commuters on the mega-franchise is this will not resolve cancellations and delays in the short-term.There is a shortage of ""route-trained"" drivers for London's central tunnelled section, which could take months to resolve .Emily Ketchin, founder of campaign group Harpenden Thameslink Commuters, said: ""The so-called timetable that Thameslink is running today is more like a lottery.""Customers need to see leadership and a rapid improvement to correct the errors that Mr Horton is leaving behind.""Anthony Smith, chief executive of passenger watchdog Transport Focus, said: ""Passengers will probably welcome a fresh start and this recognition of the problems.""A Department for Transport spokesman said: ""Clearly the disruption that passengers have experienced following the recent timetabling changes has been unacceptable and it is right that the industry takes responsibility for its performance.""We will continue to work closely with GTR's leadership to deliver improved services for passengers. Meanwhile, an independent inquiry will get to the bottom of what happened and make sure this does not happen again.""Bedford commuters said Thameslink services were ""destroying lives"".Katy Marshall said trains were dangerously overcrowded, and Ellie Jones said people were left standing and ""falling into each other"" on trains, with nothing to hold on to.Dawn Sawyer-Sheppard said: ""We cannot continue like this, it's destroying lives, jobs and towns.""Another commuter, Fabrizio Garguulo, described Thameslink as a ""poor excuse for a train service"".Louisa Branson said: ""I think that the mental health impact on all commuters is a ticking bomb. People are trying to be kind and decent to each other but after long busy days in the city, patience with one another is wearing very thin on the routes home.""I for one struggle with being so up close and personal with my fellow sufferers.""AA president and Thameslink season ticket holder Edmund King said it had gone beyond a joke, adding: ""If this sorry performance continues, more passengers will give up on the railways and take to the congested roads."""
2018-06-16,Universal Credit 'not value for money',https://web.archive.org//web/20180616211700/https://www.bbc.com/news/education-44468437,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe government's flagship benefits system has been too slow to roll out, causes hardship, and is not delivering value for money, a watchdog has said.The National Audit Office said the £1.9bn Universal Credit system could end up costing more to administer than the benefits system it is replacing. Some claimants waited eight months for payment amid the switch to UC, which rolls six benefits into one, it adds.The government said UC would bring a £34bn return over 10 years.It said more people would get into work - and stay there longer - and that it had taken a ""listen and learn"" approach to the introduction of the programme.The move to UC has long been criticised for its delayed and flawed implementation, with about 25% (113,000) of new claims in 2017 being paid late.Sherry Fuller was made redundant last year after working in local government for 17 years and she started on UC one month ago.She says without the help of friends and family she would be homeless as the payment doesn't cover her essential costs.""It's a horrible place to be. Very often you are getting so little money that you are having to rely on food banks, having to rely on the goodwill of those around you.""Helen Stephens, from Manchester, also had to borrow from friends and family after waiting over two months for a UC payment and says that badly affected her mental health.She said: ""This drove me to depression as I had never needed anything like that in the past. I felt helpless and worthless.""It would appear to me that Universal Credit is designed to be very difficult and give people as little as possible.""Meg Hillier, chairwoman of the Public Accounts Committee, said UC had been ""one long catalogue of delay with huge impact on people's lives"".And the Child Poverty Action Group questioned whether the government should push on with a programme that was ""demonstrably failing"".Key findings in the National Audit Office included:The report noted that ""the Department for Work and Pensions does not accept that UC has caused hardship among claimants"".It pointed to a recent internal departmental report that showed 40% of claimants were experiencing financial difficulties.Analysis of DWP payment data for 2017 revealed late payments were delayed on average by four weeks, but from January to October 2017, 40% of those affected by late payments waited a total of about 11 weeks or more. Some 20% of this group waited almost five months and about 8% had to wait for eight months.Despite recent improvements, one-fifth of new claimants in March 2018 did not receive their full entitlement on time. Some 13% received no payment on time. Universal Credit merges six benefits (income support; income-based jobseeker's allowance; income-related employment and support allowance; housing benefit; child tax credit; working tax credit) into one.It was designed to make claiming benefits simpler. A single payment is paid directly into claimants' bank accounts to cover whichever benefits they are eligible for.Claimants then have to pay costs, such as rent, out of their UC payment. It can be claimed by people whether they are in or out of work - but payment decreases as you earn more.A spokesman for the DWP insisted UC was good value and would realise a return on investment of £34bn over 10 years against a cost of £2bn - with 200,000 more people in work.  ""Furthermore, 83% of claimants are satisfied with the service and the majority agree that it 'financially motivates' them to work,"" he said.Work and pensions minister Alok Sharma said the NAO report was written before the introduction of £1.5bn-worth of measures enabling people to get 100% advances on their first UC payment. Mr Sharma told the Today programme those on housing benefit could also get extra money to help them transition on to UC.""We've not seen the full impact of these very positive changes,"" he added.But Jane Ahrends, of the Child Poverty Action Group, said the NAO presented a ""justifiably bleak"" picture, urging ministers to ""pause for thought"". ""Will the government press on with a programme that is demonstrably failing - causing financial misery for families - or will it restore the money that's been taken out of Universal Credit in an effort to rehabilitate it for struggling families.""Emma Revie, chief executive of food bank charity The Trussell Trust, called for more support for ""groups of people most likely to need a food bank, and debt advice to be offered to everyone moving on to the new system"".  Shadow work and pensions secretary Margaret Greenwood said: ""This report shows just how disastrously wrong the Conservatives have got the roll out of Universal Credit."""

""While production of this so-called delicacy, which is similar to pate, has been banned in Britain since 2000, the fact that imports of it to the UK are allowed means that the suffering and mistreatment of animals continues. ""Our country, which imports about 180 to 200 tonnes of foie gras from mainland Europe each year, sadly continues to play a part in this cruel trade.""Labour MP Kerry McCarthy said foie gras was ""a product of making the animal diseased"" and most people would support an import ban if they knew the ""immense cruelty involved and if people realised that they were eating a diseased organ"".Foie gras factsFrench law states that foie gras ""belongs to the protected cultural and gastronomical heritage of France"", Farming Minister George Eustice told MPs.  ""While we are a member of the European Union, as [Mr Smith] pointed out, we are required to observe law which places restrictions on the introduction of measures that impair the movement of goods within the EU market.""But, he said: ""When we leave the European Union, we do indeed have an opportunity to look at restrictions on sales along the lines that [Mr Smith] pointed out.""Mr Eustice added there were no barriers to an ""ethical ban"" on imports under World Trade Organisation rules, and some countries, such as India, had brought one in."

Scotland's first minister says the passage of the UK's key Brexit legislation without the consent of the Scottish Parliament has ""ripped up the 20-year-old devolution convention"" in the UK. Is she right?Ms Sturgeon's tweet came after the House of Commons spent less than 20 minutes debating the EU Withdrawal Bill's impact on devolution. The SNP said that showed ""contempt for Scottish democracy"", with the party's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, leading a walk-out of his MPs during Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday.The row centres on a so-called ""power grab"", with the Scottish government accusing Westminster of keeping some powers for itself that should go to the Scottish Parliament at Holyrood, after Brexit.  The UK government says the ""temporary"" move will allow the same rules and regulations to remain in place across the whole of the UK in 24 key areas, such as agriculture, fisheries and food labelling.And it points out that the vast majority of the 153 areas where policy in devolved areas is currently decided in Brussels will go directly to the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly, meaning both will have considerably more powers after Brexit than they do now. Months of talks have failed to reach a deal - although the Welsh government dropped its opposition after changes were made that would put a limit on how long the UK government would keep the powers.Last month, the Scottish Parliament voted overwhelmingly to refuse consent for the Brexit bill, with the SNP being joined by Labour, the Greens and Liberal Democrat MSPs and only the Conservatives voting against. The UK government pressed on regardless - so how was it able to do so? When the devolved Scottish Parliament was set up in 1999, it was handed control over many policy areas such as health and education that had previously been decided at Westminster.However, an agreement signed by the two governments in 2001 stated that ""the United Kingdom Parliament retains authority to legislate on any issue, whether devolved or not"" and that it was ""ultimately for parliament to decide what use to make of that power"". It also stated that the UK government ""will proceed in accordance with the convention that the UK Parliament would not normally legislate with regard to devolved matters except with the agreement of the devolved legislature"". This agreement was inserted into the Scotland Act in 2016, which was drawn up after the independence referendum two years earlier.The word ""normally"" is, of course, an important caveat that is open to different interpretations - is Brexit ""normal"", for example?Scottish Secretary David Mundell said these were not normal times and a failure to proceed with the bill would jeopardise businesses across the UK.He accused the Scottish government of wanting a veto over arrangements that would apply to the whole of the UK and insisted the UK government ""followed the spirit and letter of the devolution settlement at every stage"" despite the failure to secure consent.  Consent is sought through something known as the Sewel Convention, named after former Labour government minister Lord Sewel, which, in effect, allowed the UK government to ask MSPs for permission to change the law in an area that is devolved to Holyrood. Similar conventions apply in both Wales and Northern Ireland. Until Brexit came along, the Scottish Parliament had only once before refused to give its consent - over some aspects of the Welfare Reform Bill in 2011, which resulted in the Scottish government introducing its own legislation to resolve the row. So Ms Sturgeon is correct to say that pushing through the EU Withdrawal Bill without the consent of the Scottish Parliament means that the long-standing convention has, in effect, been ""ripped up"".However, as its name suggests, it is merely a convention and there is no legal requirement for the UK government to seek Holyrood's permission - or to respect its decision if it says ""no"". This was confirmed by the Supreme Court last year, when it ruled on the case brought by Gina Miller about the triggering of Article 50, which started the Brexit process. Judges ruled that the Sewel Convention was not a legally enforceable rule despite being inserted into the Scotland Act.This meant that the Scottish Parliament did not have a veto over Article 50 or, by extension, the EU Withdrawal Bill. Regardless, ignoring the result of the Scottish Parliament vote was sure to provoke fury from the SNP, with Ms Sturgeon warning that ""the decision to act without our consent, and the manner of doing it, will not be forgotten"".Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questionsFollow us on Twitter"

Plaid have an official window whereby any member of the assembly group can put their names forward for the leadership. It comes around every two years and it's open for another three weeks.The party also have a weekly news briefing with journalists, each member of the group taking it in turn to appear. What an opportune time it was to ask Mr ap Iorwerth about his intentions. ""No plans to challenge"" he said, as question after question honed in on the same subject. What else could he say? Some took it to be a categorical assurance that he wouldn't challenge Leanne Wood. ""Plans"" change, of course, and I suspect they changed 24 hours later.That's when an emboldened Leanne Wood said she would ""welcome"" a challenge.  In a BBC interview she mentioned Rhun ap Iorwerth by name and her opposition to the Wylfa Newydd nuclear power station became evident.  It's a project he's supporting. It all amounted to what looks like a ""put up or shut up"" strategy and opened the door for ""plans"" to change.Those close to Rhun ap Iorwerth say he's coming under increasing pressure to stand; that was Wednesday night, by the way.On Thursday morning sources close to Adam Price were saying the same thing. He's got the backing of councillors and constituency parties in Carmarthenshire already. But does he want it? Mr Price, currently on paternity leave, hasn't come under the same amount of scrutiny as his potential rivals this week. In 2016 he was described by MP Jonathan Edwards as a ""once in a generation politician … an X factor politician"", labelled by some the ""Mab Darogan"" - prophetic son - of Welsh folklore. Mr Edwards, as it happened, led Ms Wood's leadership campaign in 2012. It could be awkward.So here's what will happen next - a drip, drip of stories about calls for both Rhun ap Iorwerth and Adam Price to stand.  Watch out for something along the lines of ""it's impossible to ignore what the members want"" or ""because Leanne has welcomed a challenge"".  Three AMs have already signed a letter urging colleagues to stand.It gives the challengers a way in to the contest, and the incumbent will at least have clarity about her position at the end of the process.Behind the scenes I suspect it's game on already."
2018-06-16,A fifty-year building safety problem,https://web.archive.org//web/20180616211700/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44498608,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAt approximately 5:45am on Thursday 16th May 1968, Ivy Hodge lit a match. A duff connection between the gas main and her cooker, however, had allowed gas to leak into the kitchen. The cloud exploded, throwing her to the floor. She was knocked out and received some minor burns. And when she came to, found a large portion of the 22-storey high rise in which she lived had collapsed. The Ronan Point disaster took place almost exactly 50 years ago, and there are clear parallels to Grenfell: in both cases, government policy was pointed at one objective but lost sight of building safety. In recent years, energy efficiency was the goal: hundreds of buildings were funded to install insulation on their exterior walls. In 1968, the target was mass-building of new homes.Sir Keith Joseph, as housing minister from 1962 to 1964, had called for a rise in house-building productivity to cope with the postwar baby booms and wartime bombing. Ronan Point was part of the answer to that call: a brand-new tower block, built using modern techniques that required little skilled labour - or even scaffolding. It was one of the new ""Large Panel System"" designs.Hannah Brack, an independent researcher, has uncovered records which show Anthony Greenwood, the housing minister at the time of the collapse, wrote to Prime Minister Harold Wilson on that very day worrying about central government culpability: they had ""pushed"" the design onto local authorities.The explosion was not huge. Miss Hodge survived - so did her oven, which she took to her new home. When estimating the size of the force applied to the wall, the inquiry notes her eardrums did not burst. But, in the words of the official inquiry, the force was enough to blow out ""the external load-bearing flank walls"" of the flat. In short, the blast knocked out the wall supporting the flats above hers. They, in turn, fell down with enough force to destroy the floors beneath hers. It is a miracle that only four people were killed. Had it occurred later in the day, when more people were in their living rooms, it could have been much higher.The panel-built system is a vulnerable design: in short, you took big panels of concrete. Then, with a crane, you stood up some panels to act as walls, then laid others horizontally on top of them to be floors and ceilings. When you had done one floor, you climbed on top of it, and then did the next. The design was simple, but had two terrible problems. First, was the importance of the joints. Load-bearing walls could be knocked out, as at Ronan Point, if the walls and ceilings were not joined effectively. Technical guidance from 1968 on these buildings actually stated: ""One can hardly over-emphasise the absolute necessity of effectively joining  the various components of the structure together in order to obviate any  possible tendency for it to behave like a 'house of cards'""But bolts to hold them together were often missing. Cavities that should have been filled with concrete were found stuffed with rubbish and newspaper. The buildings were built by unskilled workers paid on a piecework basis: in short, they got paid more for working faster.Second, there was a problem with fire. If you have a fire in a flat, the ceiling panel above the fire will heat up faster than the rest. That will mean it expands, and presses the walls outward. That can create large holes in the walls, through which fire, heat and smoke can spread. In extremis, the fire could cause panels to fall out of the wall, and cause collapse. In 1984, Newham ran a test on the then-unoccupied Ronan Point.  They set a fire in a flat to see how serious these issues were - but stopped it, fearing the whole building would fall over.So what happened next? There were lots of buildings built to the same design. They were ordered to be checked and strengthened, and gas supplies were removed from them. The most important response was replacing gas cookers with electric ones.Lots of these buildings survive: Ms Brack has found at least 1,585 of them still standing. There are 200 towers with 20 storeys or more. You can recognise them easily: they should still have no gas fittings, and usually have a sign that tells residents they are banned from bringing calor gas into the building. Lots have also been pulled down. What we have left has been looked after: councils have invested a lot in strengthening works. But during the investigations following Grenfell, boroughs have found major problems with their towers: the Ledbury Estate in Southwark was evacuated.Since then, concerns have been growing in official circles about just what state these towers are in. In August last year, the government asked local authorities to check their large panel system buildings. In Leicester, a tower is being demolished. In Portsmouth, two towers are being emptied to permit strengthening works. In Hammersmith and Fulham, two towers are being reinforced. The government has asked the Buildings Research Establishment - our key laboratory for building safety - to see if it can update its guidance on how to keep these buildings in a safe condition. To assist with that, a tower in London being demolished is going to be inspected as it is taken apart to see if we can learn more about how they were put up and how they have aged.The ministry of housing told Newsnight: ""We continue to monitor these issues through our comprehensive building safety programme and will provide further guidance if that is needed.""But, looking ahead, as they age, the chance of problems rises. Time is not making them better built or rendering the materials stronger. Wind, heat and rain take a toll. Metal bolts rust, expand and cause cracks in the concrete around them (so-called ""concrete cancer"").  So what now?  Central government should think about what comes next. There are strong reasons not to take down buildings precipitously. Local authorities and housing associations have strong financial incentives to keep these buildings in service as long as possible. And to the people inside them, they're homes - homes with big, airy rooms and, for lots of residents, nice views.But these buildings are entering the end of their service lives. The vulnerabilities are growing. Central government may need to work out a plan for decommissioning the surviving LPS towers in an orderly manner. We got 50 years out of buildings that were poorly built to a fundamentally flawed design. We should not push our luck - or wait for it to run out."

2018-06-16,Ministers blink first,https://web.archive.org//web/20180616211700/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-parliaments-44457832,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowMaybe it was the moment when the former education secretary, Justine Greening, intervened on her former ministerial colleague, Dominic Grieve, that the government realised the game was up. She was so supportive towards the former attorney general, as he argued for Parliament to have a ""meaningful vote"" on the terms of the Brexit deal, that it seemed probable she would join the Euro-rebels in voting for it….For some time the government Chief Whip Julian Smith had been flitting round the Chamber talking to his troops - then he went and had a word with the Solicitor General, Robert Buckland, the government's in-house legal eagle, who is dealing with the techie legal aspects of the EU (Withdrawal) Bill. Soon after, Mr Buckland intervened on Mr Grieve to suggest talks over a compromise deal. It appeared that the head count had been done, and the concession followed. Most dangerousThe meaningful vote is probably the most dangerous of the Lords amendments to the EU (Withdrawal) Bill - because it tees up an unpredictable vote on the final terms of Brexit, towards the end of this year, and opens up the possibility that MPs could demand that ministers change policy, in the event the terms were rejected by the House, or no deal was reached in the talks with the EU….. they could even demand (drumroll) a second referendum…The government would not have sought a deal if it thought it had the votes to win, and they clearly blinked. The decision to seek a compromise marked an important victory for the soft Brexit/Remainer/""realist"" Tory rebels, who have been promised an amendment giving them most of what they want. As I write the full terms of the deal have yet to be revealed, but there is briefing ministers have conceded that a motion, which could be amended, would be put before MPs, in event a final divorce deal is voted down. In other words, in the event of a divorce deal that the Commons refused to accept, MPs would be able to set a new course for Brexit. This whole idea was denounced by Brexiteers as a Trojan horse for Remainers, and for a second referendum, so that concession could well produce some blowback. But for now, the government seems to have prevented an embarrassing defeat, and the Tory rebels have avoided the unpleasantness of colluding in the defeat of their Prime Minister. One of the leading Tory rebels has told the BBC ""the government has bent not broken"" but it leaves the ""fight for another day"".But ministers now know that a narrow but decisive Commons majority can be assembled against them on critical Brexit issues, and that its next outing could well be on a more substantive vote on a customs union. Will that knowledge mean a softer Brexit strategy will now emerge?"
2018-06-16,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20180616211700/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks have now moved on to future relations - after agreement was reached on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree within six months on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide, but first let's go back to the basics...It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.1% in the first three months of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.4%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand near a 40-year year low of 4.2%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 4.2% in the year to March 2018, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May is seeking to put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. If passed, it will end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, is supposed to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each playing roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanAn agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement wopuld only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.The full details are not yet known but UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72.We don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pounds buy fewer euros. A slump in the value of the dollar means the exchange rate with the pound is pretty close to where it was before the referendum.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.The UK has proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.A method for calculating the bill has been agreed, but the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more.The question of how and when payments will be made still needs to resolved, but it will be a schedule lasting for many years to come, and it is highly unlikely that anyone will ever be able to give an exact figure for the size of the divorce bill.UK sources say it will be up to £40bn, but some EU sources expect it to be higher than that. No-one can say for sure, and both sides want to keep it that way.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 6.5% in 2016 to 2.7% in 2017, according to the Halifax. It said the slowdown was driven by a squeeze on real wage growth.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-06-16,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180616211700/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to £840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

As I write, Mrs May is holed up with her advisers inside Tory HQ. But a former minister Anna Soubry has called for her to ""consider her position"" - political code for calling for her to resign. Read more from LauraJohn Curtice, Professor of Politics at the University of StrathclydeThis is the third post-war snap election called unexpectedly before a party's term of office had come to an end.  On the two previous occasions in 1970 and February 1974 the PM and the party lost office. While there is no other conceivable administration in the new parliament other than a Conservative-led one, it remains to be seen whether the PM will retain her position. However, so long as the Conservatives can reach an accommodation with the DUP they will have a working majority in the House of Commons.  BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed:When the general election exit poll was revealed at 10pm, the pound immediately dropped by 2% as investors took a position that a hung parliament was a possible outcome of the general election.Why would that cause the currency to decline? Because a hung parliament means that the government's direction of travel would be less certain.

2018-06-17,NHS 'needs 10-year plan for funding boost',https://web.archive.org//web/20180618040313/https://www.bbc.com/news/health-44516123,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowTax rises will be needed to pay for the boost in NHS funding announced by the government, the prime minister says.Theresa May conceded the public would pay more, but promised this would be done in a ""fair and balanced"" way.The government also says economic growth and a ""Brexit dividend"" will help cover the costs of the increased spending, which will see NHS England's budget increase by £20bn by 2023.Labour's John McDonnell called the funding model ""not credible"".He - and others - have been critical about whether there will be the savings from Brexit that ministers are claiming.But in a speech in London, Mrs May insisted it would free up money.""Some of the extra funding I am promising today will come from using the money we will no longer spend on our annual membership subscription to the European Union after we have left.""However, she added that ""taxpayers will have to contribute a bit more in a fair and balanced way to support the NHS we all use"".In return, Mrs May said the NHS had to play its part to ensure ""every penny is well spent"".She has asked NHS England boss Simon Stevens to work with senior doctors to come up with a 10-year plan, looking at productivity, staffing and key areas such as mental health and cancer survival.""It must be a plan that tackles waste, reduces bureaucracy and eliminates unacceptable variation,"" Mrs May said.At the weekend, the government announced the NHS England budget would increase by 3.4% a year on average over the next five years.That means by 2023 the budget will be £20bn higher than it is now, once inflation is taken into account.Currently, NHS England spends £114bn a year.But the plan does not include other parts of the wider health budget, such as training, stop-smoking clinics and other preventative services, so the overall ""health"" increase might be lower than 3.4%.The average annual rise since the foundation of the NHS in 1948 is 3.7%.The plan also means more money will also be given to the rest of the UK - about £4bn - although it will be up to the Welsh and Scottish governments to decide how that is spent.Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the boost in funding was agreed with the Treasury on the basis it would come from three sources - Brexit, economic growth and the taxation system.Mr Hunt did not spell out what that could mean for taxes - but to increase the burden of taxation governments can increase tax rates, extend what is included in taxes, such as increasing the goods and services VAT is applied to, or change the thresholds at which tax is charged.Referring to Brexit, Mr Hunt said: ""We won't be paying subscriptions to Brussels... but that alone won't be anything like enough."" The idea of a ""Brexit dividend"" - a term used by Mrs May on Sunday - has attracted criticism.The Conservative chair of the Commons' Health and Social Care Committee, Sarah Wollaston, said the idea of a Brexit dividend was ""tosh"".And Paul Johnson, director of economic think-tank the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), said the only way the rise could be paid for was by an increase in taxes. He said the financial settlement with the EU, plus the UK's commitments to replace EU funding, ""already uses up all of our EU contributions"" for the next few years.It was a significant funding announcement - few at senior levels in the NHS in England disagree with that.But as the dust settles after the weekend, several unanswered questions are still hanging in the air.What about the areas of health which are not covered? What about investment in hospital buildings and equipment? How will it be paid for?Read more from HughMinisters say there will be more details in the Budget - and there will be a desire to keep any rises to a minimum given the Conservative Party manifesto at the last election said its intention was to reduce taxes on businesses and working families.Mrs May made the point that economic growth would mean there was more money available for public services anyway.But she did acknowledge ""the taxpayer will have to contribute a bit more"".The IFS has looked at how much could be brought in and what the options are.The manifesto ruled out a rise in VAT, but that does not exclude extending the range of goods the tax is applied to.A commitment has also been made to reduce corporation tax.Income tax and National Insurance are the two biggest sources of tax revenue to the government.The IFS says adding a penny to the basic rate of income tax would raise £4bn, while 1p on all the main rates of NI would bring in nearly £10bn.Changing the thresholds at which different rates are applied is another option.Work on the plan will get under way almost immediately, with final proposals expected towards the end of the year.Four main areas of the NHS will be looked at:The plan will build on the five-year strategy Mr Stevens set out in 2015.A big part of that was shifting care out of hospitals and into the community.Mrs May is known to be keen to see a specific stress on mental health and improving cancer survival rates this time.In her speech on Monday, the PM recalled her own reliance on the NHS for help when she was diagnosed with type one diabetes, saying: ""I would not be doing the job I am doing today without that support.""Meanwhile, councils have questioned why the funding announcement did not also include more money for social care and public health, which covers everything from stop smoking services to obesity prevention.Both are considered essential to the sustainability of the NHS, but the increase announced only applied to front-line NHS services such as hospitals, GPs and mental health care.Councillor Izzi Seccombe, of the Local Government Association, said: ""Without essential council services, which help people live healthy lives in their own homes and communities, the NHS cannot thrive.""The government said plans to reform the system will be published in the coming months.Read more from NickFollow Nick on Twitter"
2018-06-17,Government 'could collapse' over Brexit deal,https://web.archive.org//web/20180618040313/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44511969,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowTory rebels ""could collapse the government"" if they vote against a Brexit deal negotiated with the EU, a leading rebel has said.Dominic Grieve said he wakes up ""in a cold sweat"" thinking about what could happen if a final deal is rejected. But he suggested rebels would not back down in a current row with ministers about how much of a say MPs should get.The EU Withdrawal Bill returns to the Lords and Commons this week, with further rebellions expected.Last week the government avoided a defeat on the bill after agreeing to hold further talks with rebels.They want a bigger role for Parliament, should a final Brexit deal be rejected by MPs, or if no deal is reached - the so-called ""meaningful vote"".Former Attorney General Mr Grieve told BBC One's Sunday Politics that he thought they had agreed MPs could have an ""advisory"" vote, that would not order the government to do anything, but would help people to ""keep calm"" during what would be a ""critical situation"". But after two days of talks, Mr Grieve said a government amendment drawn up to avert a rebellion was changed at the last minute and was now ""valueless"".  He implied rebels would vote against it this week: ""I'm absolutely sure that the group is quite determined that the meaningful vote pledge, which was given to us, has got to be fulfilled.""He added: ""The alternative is that we've all got to sign up to a slavery clause now, saying whatever the government does, when it comes to January, however potentially catastrophic it might be for my constituents and my country, I'm signing in blood now that I will follow over the edge of a cliff, and that I can tell you, I am not prepared to do.""   The government's amendment to the EU (Withdrawal) Bill sets out what must happen in the event of three scenarios: If MPs vote down the UK-EU Brexit deal, if Theresa May announces before 21 January 2019 that no deal has been reached, or if 21st January passes with no deal being struck.Under these circumstances, a minister must make a statement in Parliament setting out their next steps and give MPs an opportunity to vote.However, the vote would be on ""a motion in neutral terms"", merely stating that the House has considered the statement.Rebels had originally wanted the amendment to say that the government must seek the approval of Parliament for its course of action - and that ministers must be directed by MPs and peers.When it was put to him that voting against any Brexit deal at ""the 11th hour"" of negotiations could cause the government to collapse, he replied:  ""We could collapse the government and I can assure you, I wake up at 2am in a cold sweat thinking about the problems that we have put on our shoulders."" Last week another Conservative MP, Tom Tugendhat, told Sky News there was ""going to be a new government"" if MPs rejected the government's Brexit deal.Solicitor General Robert Buckland said that ""however well intentioned"" Mr Grieve's plan had been, his worry was that ""it actually plays badly in the most important negotiation, which is over in Brussels"".It would imply to the EU, he said, that ""there's a third party in this relationship"" - Parliament - which could ""trump whatever the UK government say"". He said ministers would stick with the new amendment for Monday, adding: ""Let's see what the Lords make of it. Of course we have Tuesday to consider matters ahead of the Wednesday vote.""Earlier the prime minister defended her handling of the row.She told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show she had met Tory rebels and ""undertook to consider their concerns"".She admitted there had been ""a debate"" about what a ""meaningful"" vote for Parliament meant: ""I've listened carefully to the concerns, I've put an amendment down which I think balances this issue of the role of Parliament together with the need for us to ensure we don't overturn the decision of the British people.""But she said Parliament ""cannot tie the hands of government in negotiations"".The main purposes of the EU Withdrawal Bill are to end the supremacy of EU law in the UK, and transfer existing EU law into UK law so the same rules and regulations apply on the day after Brexit.But as it passes through Parliament, MPs and peers have been trying to change it, in some cases adding bits on that would change the government's Brexit strategy.The government says the whole row is about a ""hypothetical"" scenario and they are ""confident we will agree a good deal with the EU which Parliament will support""."
2018-06-17,Theresa May unveils £20bn boost for NHS,https://web.archive.org//web/20180618040313/https://www.bbc.com/news/health-44495598,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe NHS in England is to get an extra £20bn a year by 2023 as a 70th ""birthday present"", Theresa May says.It means the £114bn budget will rise by an average of 3.4% annually - but that is still less than the 3.7% average rise the NHS has had since 1948.The prime minister said this would be funded partly by a ""Brexit dividend"", but also hinted at tax rises.Labour said the government had failed to fund the NHS properly and was relying on a ""hypothetical"" windfall.Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said Labour's taxation plans meant his party could match the Conservatives' spending plans and ""will go further"".In her BBC interview, Mrs May did not spell out how the £20bn a year would be funded but said: ""As a country we will be contributing more, a bit more, but also we will have that sum of money that is available from the European Union.""But Commons Health and Social Care Committee chairwoman Sarah Wollaston described the idea of a Brexit dividend as ""tosh"".The Conservative MP accused the government of using ""populist arguments rather than evidence"".And the director of economic think tank the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), Paul Johnson, has tweeted to say ""there is no Brexit dividend"".The five-year funding settlement covers just front-line budgets overseen by NHS England.About a 10th of the overall health budget is held by other bodies for things such as training and healthy lifestyle programmes, including stop smoking services and obesity prevention programmes.The BBC understands these will be protected, but beyond that it is unclear what will happen to them.The 2015 spending review - the last time a five-year settlement was announced - saw these budgets cut to help pay for an £8bn increase in NHS England's budget.All figures are above inflationThe announcement means extra money will also be made available for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, although it will be up to the Welsh and Scottish governments to decide how that is spent.Speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr, Mrs May acknowledged that pressure had been growing on the NHS, which was founded 70 years ago, and said her formal announcement on Monday would be about ""securing its future"".""We're going to ensure there's a 10-year plan for the NHS,"" she said. ""That will be a plan for world-class health care - more doctors, more nurses. It means extra money - significantly more money going into the NHS.""Mr Ashworth told the BBC's Sunday Politics that Labour's tax plans meant it would be able to spend more but added the exact percentage of how much it could increase spending by would have to wait until the chancellor presented his own spending plans. And shadow chancellor John McDonnell dismissed the government announcement as a ""publicity stunt"", adding: ""Can you imagine if I came forward with this? There'd be accusations of magic money trees. This is a magic money forest that's come out this morning.""Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents NHS trusts, said the government's settlement was the ""minimum"" that was needed.""After almost a decade of austerity, the NHS has a lot of catching up to do.""By Jonathan Blake, BBC political correspondentStep back from the big figures and the arguments about Brexit and there is something significant in Theresa May's announcement. A Conservative prime minister promising more money for public services, with the implication that taxes could go up to pay for it. Because when Mrs May talks about ""contributing more as a country"" that is what she means. You'll struggle to find a politician arguing against a boost for the NHS, but there might just be one or two Tories privately questioning whether this portrays them as a tax-and-spend party. Support for the NHS is such a big political prize that Mrs May appears willing to go against traditional Conservative low-tax instincts.The government clearly feels the detail on funding is for another day.There will be difficult decisions ahead - but the prime minister appears to be saying ""trust me"".Mr Hopson also pointed out that the government needed to work out what it was going to do about social care run by councils.Ministers have promised the system, covering care homes and help at home, will be reformed soon to ensure there is better access to services.And Niall Dickson, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents healthcare organisations, said the announcement ""isn't a bonanza by any means"" and that it fell short of the of the 4% extra-a-year figure an independent report had suggested was needed.However, he added: ""It's a lot better than we've been used to over the last few years.""And Ian Dalton, head of regulator NHS Improvement, said the settlement was good news for the NHS and would ""enable the dedicated staff in our NHS to go on improving the care we can offer the patients"".In her BBC interview, Mrs May said the funding boost was partly coming from a ""Brexit dividend"".""Some people may remember seeing a figure on the side of a bus a while back of £350m a week in cash,"" she said.""I can tell you that what I'm announcing will mean that in 2023-24 there will be about £600m a week, more in cash, going into the NHS.""That will be through the Brexit dividend. The fact that we're no longer sending vast amounts of money every year to the EU once we leave the EU.""But she also conceded that ""as a country"" we will need to contribute more.She did not spell out that would require tax rises, although a recent report by the IFS said they would be needed because it was hard to imagine the money could be found from economic growth or raiding other areas of government spending.And Mr Johnson said the government had accepted Brexit would weaken the public finances and the financial settlement with the EU plus commitments to replace EU funding ""already uses up all of our EU contributions"" for the next few years.There has been a lot of speculation that Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt - supported by NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens - had been pushing for close to 4% a year extra. This was the figure many in the health service had said was needed to get services back on track and to improve waiting times.Reports have suggested the Treasury were initially offering less than 3%.So the 3.4% average appears to be a compromise between the two camps - and is close to the 3.7% average increase the NHS has seen if you look back over the past 70 years.So what will this mean? The final picture is somewhat clouded by the lack of clarity about what will happen to the wider health budget.However, talk to those working for the health service and they say this was the ""bare minimum"" that was needed to keep services going. They say tough choices will still be needed and that the public should not expect a dramatic increase in performance - targets for cancer, A&E and hospital operations are all being missed."

Home Office proposals announced last month aim to give police drivers more legal protection and aim to smash the ""myth"" that officers cannot pursue riders who are not wearing helmets.It followed concerns among officers that they risk prosecution for careless or dangerous driving if they chase criminals at high speed, particularly those on mopeds and motorcycles.Mr Javid told the newspaper: ""It's ridiculous. Police should be allowed to get on with the job.""If someone commits a crime and police want to pursue them, they should have much more freedom to.""Use our tool to see how badly your neighbourhood is affected (London only).

He is banned from taking the remedy at home.A spokeswoman for the Home Office said it had granted an ""exceptional licence"" for a ""short term emergency"" and it would be reviewed.The Home Office's initial decision, and then its reversal, prompted calls for drug law reform from MPs on all sides.Mr Blunt, a Conservative, said the existing law was based on an ""outdated"" claim that cannabis had no medicinal value.He told BBC Radio 5 Live that there was ""very well established science"" that cannabis help various epileptic conditions and some multiple sclerosis symptoms.""We need to get serious now about getting the benefits of these medicines, and move to change the frankly absurd position we are in,"" he said.Former Conservative health minister Dan Poulter said the current situation was ""ridiculous"" and he said he would push for an urgent change in the law.He said: ""I genuinely don't understand why we see... medicinal cannabis through the prism of the 1971 Misuse of Drugs legislation, when actually this is a medical issue, it's not a prohibition of drugs issue, and that's what's got to change.""We've got to move this away from the Home Office and allow doctors to prescribe this just as they can prescribe many other drugs, under supervision, for the benefit of their patients.""Other MPs including Green Party co-leader Caroline Lucas, Labour MP Paul Flynn and Lib Dem MP Norman Lamb all called for the legalisation of medicinal cannabis.Lib Dem MP Norman Baker, a former Home Office minister, said he had called for a change in the laws on medicinal cannabis when in office but had been ""obstructed all the way"" by then home secretary Theresa May, who he accused of having ""some sort of pathological fear of cannabis"".After Billy received the cannabis oil on Saturday, Ms Caldwell, from County Tyrone, said his ""little body has been completely broken and his little mind"".""No other family should have to go through this sort of ordeal, travelling halfway round the world to get medication which should be freely available,"" she said.""My experience leaves me in no doubt that the Home Office can no longer play a role in the administration of medication for sick children in our country.""In 2017, Billy was prescribed the medication on the NHS. But in May this year, his GP was told he could no longer prescribe it.At the time the Department of Health in Northern Ireland said cannabis had not yet been licensed in the UK as a medicine.CBD and Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) are two types of cannabinoids found naturally in the resin of the marijuana plant.A cannabis-based drug called Sativex has been licensed in the UK to treat MS. It contains THC and CBD. Doctors could, in theory, prescribe it for other things outside of this licence, but at their own risk. MS patients prescribed Sativex, who resupply it to other people, also face prosecution. Another licensed treatment is Nabilone. It contains an artificial version of THC and can be given to cancer patients to help relieve nausea during chemotherapy.Source: NHS Choices"

Her speech mentioned the big issues like Brexit and the stalemate at Stormont - but it also focused on Sinn Féin's bid to get into government in Dublin - touching numerous policy bases such as housing, healthcare and education.""To those who are on an agenda to exclude us, I invite them to wake up and smell the coffee,"" she said. She also paid tribute to her predecessor Gerry Adams.But with Ms McDonald and Michelle O'Neill now leading the charge for Sinn Féin, it's perhaps fitting that the party's conference played out with ""sisters are doing it for themselves"" blasting from the speakers. She said the party ""remain in a fixed, negative space"", but that Sinn Féin is still committed to the restoration of power-sharing at Stormont.Northern Ireland has been without a government since the DUP- Sinn Féin coalition collapsed in January 2017.""A power-sharing executive and assembly in the north is still the right thing - and we are up for that,"" Ms McDonald said.However, without a return to Stormont in the near future, Ms McDonald reiterated her call for London and Dublin to reconvene the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference ""without further delay"".""People in the north cannot wait while the DUP play political games and go into hiding,"" she added.Ms McDonald also addressed speculation about the prospect of Sinn Féin entering government in the Republic of Ireland in the future.She told delegates she wants to lead Sinn Fein ""into a progressive government in the south"".""After the next election, Sinn Féin will talk to all political parties and the independents,"" she said.""It is not for Leo Varadkar (Irish prime minister) or Micheál Martin (the leader of Fianna Fail) to decide whether or not we enter government.""That decision will be made in the first instance by the people."""

Sir Christopher's intervention was met with shouts of ""shame"" from other MPs.Ministers have criticised him, with Justice Secretary David Gauke tweeting his disappointment.But his backbench colleagues have gone further - Tory MP Nick Boles tweeted that Sir Christopher was a politician ""whose knuckles dragged along the ground"".And George Freeman, who used to lead Theresa May's policy unit, said the move was ""an affront to parliamentary democracy"".Minister for Women Victoria Atkins said the government will allocate time for the bill in Parliament to ensure it does not get pushed down the list of private members' bills.Sir Christopher has yet to speak out about his intervention, but upskirting victim Gina Martin - who started the campaign for the new law - said he told her he objected ""on principle"" because it ""wasn't debated"".She told the BBC he said he ""wasn't really sure"" what upskirting was. ""I said, 'well, I can help you with that',"" Ms Martin added. Liberal Democrat MP Wera Hobhouse, who brought the private member's bill to Parliament, also  criticised the ""out-of-touch Tory"" for ""sabotaging"" it. She has asked for her bill to return to the House on 6 July. Dawn Butler, Labour's shadow minister for women and equalities, said it was ""absolutely disgusting"" that the bill had been blocked.Justice minister Lucy Frazer said the government was ""committed to making sure upskirting becomes a criminal offence and have every expectation that this will happen"". By Mark D'Arcy, BBC parliamentary correspondentSir Christopher is a leading member of a group of backbench Conservatives who make a practice of ensuring that what they see as well-meaning but flabby legislation is not lazily plopped on to the statute book by a few MPs on a poorly-attended Friday sitting. And - after all - this is a bill to create a new criminal offence, for which people can go to jail. So, however worthy the cause, he insists on proper, extensive scrutiny, and he has spent most Commons Fridays for the last 20 years doing just that. Ms Martin said she remained ""hopeful"" and had arranged a meeting to discuss it with Sir Christopher. She started the campaign to change the law after two men took a picture up her skirt while she was at a concert in London's Hyde Park last July. Police said they were unable to prosecute as the picture was not graphic enough because she was wearing underwear.What is the current law?What are the limitations of the current situation in England and Wales?What does the new law propose?"
2018-06-17,Rebels: Brexit bill offer a slap in face,https://web.archive.org//web/20180618040313/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44482652,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe government's bid to avoid a Commons defeat on the Brexit bill has been rejected as ""slap in the face"" by leading rebel Dominic Grieve.Theresa May assured Mr Grieve ahead of a vote on Tuesday that his call for MPs to be given a greater say on a Brexit deal would be taken on board.But he said ministers had changed the wording of an amendment drawn up after talks with him, at the last minute.Further talks are expected ahead of the bill returning to Parliament next week.Solicitor General Robert Buckland said the government had to ""strike a balance"" between rebels' concerns and protecting the government's negotiating position in Brexit talks with the EU.BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said Remain-leaning Tory MPs were furious and it set the scene for another big showdown when the bill returns to Parliament.Mr Grieve, a former attorney general, told BBC One's Question Time he could not understand why the government amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill had been changed ""at the last minute"" after two days of talks.""I'd actually got on a train. I thought it was all over,"" he said.He said the problem was that if the UK reached ""the really apocalyptic moment"" where no Brexit deal had been done by early February 2019, Parliament was not being offered the chance to say what should happen next - only to ""note"" the position.Later he told BBC Radio 4's The World Tonight: ""I simply don't understand why they have done this ... It does feel, I have to say, to be blunt about it, it seems a bit like a slap in the face.""He added that rebels would ""talk further to the government and try to resolve it"".Ah ha, so just to be clear we are now going to have to amend the ‘unamendable’ after the agreed amendable amendment acquired a sneaky sting in the tail. What a time to be alive...End of Twitter post  by @sarahwollastonFellow backbencher Sarah Wollaston described the change as ""a sneaky sting in the tail"" while Anna Soubry described it as a ""big mistake by the prime minister"" adding: ""Unfortunately it looks like she's yet again caved into the hard Brexiteers."" Another pro-EU Tory MP, Stephen Hammond, suggested the amendment had been ""hijacked"" by government figures trying to ""force their will"" onto the process.Asked if ministers had caved into the demands of Brexiteers and changed the wording, Solicitor General Robert Buckland said: ""No, I'm not getting into some Tory psychodrama about this. ""Colleagues had their say and had an input into the process. No deals were done this was all a process that took several hours, to say the least, to try to produce something that could command support and I'm sorry that some colleagues feel that it doesn't go as far as they had hoped for, I really am.""But we have to make a decision, we have to move forward, table an amendment and allow their lordships to have the vigorous debate that I'm sure will follow next week.""A spokesman for the Department for Exiting the European Union said the amendment addressed a ""hypothetical"" scenario adding: ""The government is confident we will agree a good deal with the EU which Parliament will support.""The bill will now returns to the House of Lords early next week, with both the government amendment and Mr Grieve's original amendment expected to be debated. It will then return to the Commons, where a fresh showdown is expected unless a deal is hammered out. The government's amendment to the EU (Withdrawal) Bill sets out what must happen in the event of three scenarios: If MPs vote down the UK-EU Brexit deal, if Theresa May announces before 21 January 2019 that no deal has been reached, or if 21st January passes with no deal being struck.Under these circumstances, a minister must make a statement in Parliament setting out their next steps and give MPs an opportunity to vote.However, the vote would be on ""a motion in neutral terms"", merely stating that the House has considered the statement.Mr Grieve had originally wanted the amendment to say that the government must seek the approval of Parliament for its course of action - and that ministers must be directed by MPs and peers.Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer said: ""The government's amendment is simply not good enough. ""Theresa May has gone back on her word and offered an amendment that takes the meaning out of the meaningful vote. Parliament cannot - and should not - accept it.""Analysis By BBC political correspondent Ben WrightFormer Attorney General Dominic Grieve, Anna Soubry and perhaps a dozen of their Conservative backbench colleagues are leading the fight to ensure the Commons has the chance to shape the government's next move, if no deal is reached with the EU. That is Labour's view too. But the government is emphatic Parliament should not have that power. Why? Because that would effectively neuter the UK government's threat to the EU, that it is prepared to walk out without a deal. That's why Brexiteers are so enraged by this row. And it's why Dominic Grieve and his parliamentary posse are steeled for a drawn-out fight with their own government. The argument moves back to the Lords on Monday before a likely final showdown in the Commons next Wednesday. A compromise may be brokered before then. But a Conservative source told me the bitterness within the party was now worse than it was during the Maastricht saga in the early 1990s - of which today's battle over Brexit is, perhaps, the final act.The UK is due to leave the EU in March 2019, and negotiations have been taking place on the terms of the separation and how the two sides will work together in the future.The government is trying to pass a new law, called the EU Withdrawal Bill, which it says is needed to ensure a ""smooth and orderly Brexit"".Its main purposes are to end the supremacy of EU law in the UK, and transfer existing EU law into UK law so the same rules and regulations apply on the day after Brexit.But as it passes through Parliament, MPs and peers have been trying to change it, in some cases adding bits on that would change the government's Brexit strategy.Mr Grieve summed up the suspicion on both sides of the Brexit argument: ""One background fear is that actually there are some people who would quite like to just tip the UK out of the EU with no deal at all ... the other one is that people are trying to stop Brexit happening."""

Scotland's first minister says the passage of the UK's key Brexit legislation without the consent of the Scottish Parliament has ""ripped up the 20-year-old devolution convention"" in the UK. Is she right?Ms Sturgeon's tweet came after the House of Commons spent less than 20 minutes debating the EU Withdrawal Bill's impact on devolution. The SNP said that showed ""contempt for Scottish democracy"", with the party's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, leading a walk-out of his MPs during Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday.The row centres on a so-called ""power grab"", with the Scottish government accusing Westminster of keeping some powers for itself that should go to the Scottish Parliament at Holyrood, after Brexit.  The UK government says the ""temporary"" move will allow the same rules and regulations to remain in place across the whole of the UK in 24 key areas, such as agriculture, fisheries and food labelling.And it points out that the vast majority of the 153 areas where policy in devolved areas is currently decided in Brussels will go directly to the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly, meaning both will have considerably more powers after Brexit than they do now. Months of talks have failed to reach a deal - although the Welsh government dropped its opposition after changes were made that would put a limit on how long the UK government would keep the powers.Last month, the Scottish Parliament voted overwhelmingly to refuse consent for the Brexit bill, with the SNP being joined by Labour, the Greens and Liberal Democrat MSPs and only the Conservatives voting against. The UK government pressed on regardless - so how was it able to do so? When the devolved Scottish Parliament was set up in 1999, it was handed control over many policy areas such as health and education that had previously been decided at Westminster.However, an agreement signed by the two governments in 2001 stated that ""the United Kingdom Parliament retains authority to legislate on any issue, whether devolved or not"" and that it was ""ultimately for parliament to decide what use to make of that power"". It also stated that the UK government ""will proceed in accordance with the convention that the UK Parliament would not normally legislate with regard to devolved matters except with the agreement of the devolved legislature"". This agreement was inserted into the Scotland Act in 2016, which was drawn up after the independence referendum two years earlier.The word ""normally"" is, of course, an important caveat that is open to different interpretations - is Brexit ""normal"", for example?Scottish Secretary David Mundell said these were not normal times and a failure to proceed with the bill would jeopardise businesses across the UK.He accused the Scottish government of wanting a veto over arrangements that would apply to the whole of the UK and insisted the UK government ""followed the spirit and letter of the devolution settlement at every stage"" despite the failure to secure consent.  Consent is sought through something known as the Sewel Convention, named after former Labour government minister Lord Sewel, which, in effect, allowed the UK government to ask MSPs for permission to change the law in an area that is devolved to Holyrood. Similar conventions apply in both Wales and Northern Ireland. Until Brexit came along, the Scottish Parliament had only once before refused to give its consent - over some aspects of the Welfare Reform Bill in 2011, which resulted in the Scottish government introducing its own legislation to resolve the row. So Ms Sturgeon is correct to say that pushing through the EU Withdrawal Bill without the consent of the Scottish Parliament means that the long-standing convention has, in effect, been ""ripped up"".However, as its name suggests, it is merely a convention and there is no legal requirement for the UK government to seek Holyrood's permission - or to respect its decision if it says ""no"". This was confirmed by the Supreme Court last year, when it ruled on the case brought by Gina Miller about the triggering of Article 50, which started the Brexit process. Judges ruled that the Sewel Convention was not a legally enforceable rule despite being inserted into the Scotland Act.This meant that the Scottish Parliament did not have a veto over Article 50 or, by extension, the EU Withdrawal Bill. Regardless, ignoring the result of the Scottish Parliament vote was sure to provoke fury from the SNP, with Ms Sturgeon warning that ""the decision to act without our consent, and the manner of doing it, will not be forgotten"".Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questionsFollow us on Twitter"
2018-06-17,Game on?,https://web.archive.org//web/20180618040313/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-44497225,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe world of political predictions is a mug's game but I'm going to call this one and I'm prepared to eat humble pie on 4 July.I was told on Twitter this week that stories about the leadership of Plaid Cymru were as a result of ""media stirring"".Here is my case for the defence and why I think there will be a three-way battle for the top job. Much was made on Tuesday of Rhun ap Iorwerth's remarks denying any plan to challenge Leanne Wood, but here's some context. Plaid have an official window whereby any member of the assembly group can put their names forward for the leadership. It comes around every two years and it's open for another three weeks.The party also have a weekly news briefing with journalists, each member of the group taking it in turn to appear. What an opportune time it was to ask Mr ap Iorwerth about his intentions. ""No plans to challenge"" he said, as question after question honed in on the same subject. What else could he say? Some took it to be a categorical assurance that he wouldn't challenge Leanne Wood. ""Plans"" change, of course, and I suspect they changed 24 hours later.That's when an emboldened Leanne Wood said she would ""welcome"" a challenge.  In a BBC interview she mentioned Rhun ap Iorwerth by name and her opposition to the Wylfa Newydd nuclear power station became evident.  It's a project he's supporting. It all amounted to what looks like a ""put up or shut up"" strategy and opened the door for ""plans"" to change.Those close to Rhun ap Iorwerth say he's coming under increasing pressure to stand; that was Wednesday night, by the way.On Thursday morning sources close to Adam Price were saying the same thing. He's got the backing of councillors and constituency parties in Carmarthenshire already. But does he want it? Mr Price, currently on paternity leave, hasn't come under the same amount of scrutiny as his potential rivals this week. In 2016 he was described by MP Jonathan Edwards as a ""once in a generation politician … an X factor politician"", labelled by some the ""Mab Darogan"" - prophetic son - of Welsh folklore. Mr Edwards, as it happened, led Ms Wood's leadership campaign in 2012. It could be awkward.So here's what will happen next - a drip, drip of stories about calls for both Rhun ap Iorwerth and Adam Price to stand.  Watch out for something along the lines of ""it's impossible to ignore what the members want"" or ""because Leanne has welcomed a challenge"".  Three AMs have already signed a letter urging colleagues to stand.It gives the challengers a way in to the contest, and the incumbent will at least have clarity about her position at the end of the process.Behind the scenes I suspect it's game on already."
2018-06-17,A fifty-year building safety problem,https://web.archive.org//web/20180618040313/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44498608,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAt approximately 5:45am on Thursday 16th May 1968, Ivy Hodge lit a match. A duff connection between the gas main and her cooker, however, had allowed gas to leak into the kitchen. The cloud exploded, throwing her to the floor. She was knocked out and received some minor burns. And when she came to, found a large portion of the 22-storey high rise in which she lived had collapsed. The Ronan Point disaster took place almost exactly 50 years ago, and there are clear parallels to Grenfell: in both cases, government policy was pointed at one objective but lost sight of building safety. In recent years, energy efficiency was the goal: hundreds of buildings were funded to install insulation on their exterior walls. In 1968, the target was mass-building of new homes.Sir Keith Joseph, as housing minister from 1962 to 1964, had called for a rise in house-building productivity to cope with the postwar baby booms and wartime bombing. Ronan Point was part of the answer to that call: a brand-new tower block, built using modern techniques that required little skilled labour - or even scaffolding. It was one of the new ""Large Panel System"" designs.Hannah Brack, an independent researcher, has uncovered records which show Anthony Greenwood, the housing minister at the time of the collapse, wrote to Prime Minister Harold Wilson on that very day worrying about central government culpability: they had ""pushed"" the design onto local authorities.The explosion was not huge. Miss Hodge survived - so did her oven, which she took to her new home. When estimating the size of the force applied to the wall, the inquiry notes her eardrums did not burst. But, in the words of the official inquiry, the force was enough to blow out ""the external load-bearing flank walls"" of the flat. In short, the blast knocked out the wall supporting the flats above hers. They, in turn, fell down with enough force to destroy the floors beneath hers. It is a miracle that only four people were killed. Had it occurred later in the day, when more people were in their living rooms, it could have been much higher.The panel-built system is a vulnerable design: in short, you took big panels of concrete. Then, with a crane, you stood up some panels to act as walls, then laid others horizontally on top of them to be floors and ceilings. When you had done one floor, you climbed on top of it, and then did the next. The design was simple, but had two terrible problems. First, was the importance of the joints. Load-bearing walls could be knocked out, as at Ronan Point, if the walls and ceilings were not joined effectively. Technical guidance from 1968 on these buildings actually stated: ""One can hardly over-emphasise the absolute necessity of effectively joining  the various components of the structure together in order to obviate any  possible tendency for it to behave like a 'house of cards'""But bolts to hold them together were often missing. Cavities that should have been filled with concrete were found stuffed with rubbish and newspaper. The buildings were built by unskilled workers paid on a piecework basis: in short, they got paid more for working faster.Second, there was a problem with fire. If you have a fire in a flat, the ceiling panel above the fire will heat up faster than the rest. That will mean it expands, and presses the walls outward. That can create large holes in the walls, through which fire, heat and smoke can spread. In extremis, the fire could cause panels to fall out of the wall, and cause collapse. In 1984, Newham ran a test on the then-unoccupied Ronan Point.  They set a fire in a flat to see how serious these issues were - but stopped it, fearing the whole building would fall over.So what happened next? There were lots of buildings built to the same design. They were ordered to be checked and strengthened, and gas supplies were removed from them. The most important response was replacing gas cookers with electric ones.Lots of these buildings survive: Ms Brack has found at least 1,585 of them still standing. There are 200 towers with 20 storeys or more. You can recognise them easily: they should still have no gas fittings, and usually have a sign that tells residents they are banned from bringing calor gas into the building. Lots have also been pulled down. What we have left has been looked after: councils have invested a lot in strengthening works. But during the investigations following Grenfell, boroughs have found major problems with their towers: the Ledbury Estate in Southwark was evacuated.Since then, concerns have been growing in official circles about just what state these towers are in. In August last year, the government asked local authorities to check their large panel system buildings. In Leicester, a tower is being demolished. In Portsmouth, two towers are being emptied to permit strengthening works. In Hammersmith and Fulham, two towers are being reinforced. The government has asked the Buildings Research Establishment - our key laboratory for building safety - to see if it can update its guidance on how to keep these buildings in a safe condition. To assist with that, a tower in London being demolished is going to be inspected as it is taken apart to see if we can learn more about how they were put up and how they have aged.The ministry of housing told Newsnight: ""We continue to monitor these issues through our comprehensive building safety programme and will provide further guidance if that is needed.""But, looking ahead, as they age, the chance of problems rises. Time is not making them better built or rendering the materials stronger. Wind, heat and rain take a toll. Metal bolts rust, expand and cause cracks in the concrete around them (so-called ""concrete cancer"").  So what now?  Central government should think about what comes next. There are strong reasons not to take down buildings precipitously. Local authorities and housing associations have strong financial incentives to keep these buildings in service as long as possible. And to the people inside them, they're homes - homes with big, airy rooms and, for lots of residents, nice views.But these buildings are entering the end of their service lives. The vulnerabilities are growing. Central government may need to work out a plan for decommissioning the surviving LPS towers in an orderly manner. We got 50 years out of buildings that were poorly built to a fundamentally flawed design. We should not push our luck - or wait for it to run out."

She was so supportive towards the former attorney general, as he argued for Parliament to have a ""meaningful vote"" on the terms of the Brexit deal, that it seemed probable she would join the Euro-rebels in voting for it….For some time the government Chief Whip Julian Smith had been flitting round the Chamber talking to his troops - then he went and had a word with the Solicitor General, Robert Buckland, the government's in-house legal eagle, who is dealing with the techie legal aspects of the EU (Withdrawal) Bill. Soon after, Mr Buckland intervened on Mr Grieve to suggest talks over a compromise deal. It appeared that the head count had been done, and the concession followed. Most dangerousThe meaningful vote is probably the most dangerous of the Lords amendments to the EU (Withdrawal) Bill - because it tees up an unpredictable vote on the final terms of Brexit, towards the end of this year, and opens up the possibility that MPs could demand that ministers change policy, in the event the terms were rejected by the House, or no deal was reached in the talks with the EU….. they could even demand (drumroll) a second referendum…The government would not have sought a deal if it thought it had the votes to win, and they clearly blinked. The decision to seek a compromise marked an important victory for the soft Brexit/Remainer/""realist"" Tory rebels, who have been promised an amendment giving them most of what they want. As I write the full terms of the deal have yet to be revealed, but there is briefing ministers have conceded that a motion, which could be amended, would be put before MPs, in event a final divorce deal is voted down. In other words, in the event of a divorce deal that the Commons refused to accept, MPs would be able to set a new course for Brexit. This whole idea was denounced by Brexiteers as a Trojan horse for Remainers, and for a second referendum, so that concession could well produce some blowback. But for now, the government seems to have prevented an embarrassing defeat, and the Tory rebels have avoided the unpleasantness of colluding in the defeat of their Prime Minister. One of the leading Tory rebels has told the BBC ""the government has bent not broken"" but it leaves the ""fight for another day"".But ministers now know that a narrow but decisive Commons majority can be assembled against them on critical Brexit issues, and that its next outing could well be on a more substantive vote on a customs union. Will that knowledge mean a softer Brexit strategy will now emerge?"

The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks have now moved on to future relations - after agreement was reached on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree within six months on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide, but first let's go back to the basics...It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.1% in the first three months of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.4%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand near a 40-year year low of 4.2%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 4.2% in the year to March 2018, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May is seeking to put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. If passed, it will end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, is supposed to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each playing roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanAn agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement wopuld only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.The full details are not yet known but UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72.We don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pounds buy fewer euros. A slump in the value of the dollar means the exchange rate with the pound is pretty close to where it was before the referendum.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.The UK has proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.A method for calculating the bill has been agreed, but the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more.The question of how and when payments will be made still needs to resolved, but it will be a schedule lasting for many years to come, and it is highly unlikely that anyone will ever be able to give an exact figure for the size of the divorce bill.UK sources say it will be up to £40bn, but some EU sources expect it to be higher than that. No-one can say for sure, and both sides want to keep it that way.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 6.5% in 2016 to 2.7% in 2017, according to the Halifax. It said the slowdown was driven by a squeeze on real wage growth.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-06-17,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180618040313/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to £840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

On the two previous occasions in 1970 and February 1974 the PM and the party lost office. While there is no other conceivable administration in the new parliament other than a Conservative-led one, it remains to be seen whether the PM will retain her position. However, so long as the Conservatives can reach an accommodation with the DUP they will have a working majority in the House of Commons.  BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed:When the general election exit poll was revealed at 10pm, the pound immediately dropped by 2% as investors took a position that a hung parliament was a possible outcome of the general election.Why would that cause the currency to decline? Because a hung parliament means that the government's direction of travel would be less certain.

And negotiations have been taking place over the terms of its departure.But there is an ongoing row about what happens if Parliament votes to reject the final deal reached between the two sides - or if no deal is reached.One side says Parliament should intervene to prevent the UK from ""crashing out"" of the EU without a deal - but critics say the prospect of this happening would undermine the UK's negotiating hand.Last week, Theresa May avoided defeat on the issue - but rebels said they were not happy with the concessions they had been offered in return for not voting against the government.Now, peers have backed an amendment from former Conservative cabinet minister Lord Hailsham, which goes further than the government's proposals on how much power MPs could get.The 119 majority was 28 more than the last time peers voted on the so-called ""meaningful vote"" issue.Lord Hailsham, who described Brexit as a ""national calamity"" in his speech, said his amendment represented what had been agreed ""in good faith"" by the would-be Tory rebels, led by former Attorney General Dominic Grieve, and Downing Street last week.""It's a matter of honour,"" he said.He also said his proposals were in the ""national interest"", adding: ""In order to safeguard our nation's vital interests, in the event that there be no deal on the table, Parliament should have the authority to intervene.""Lord Hailsham described his amendment as ""Grieve Two"", meaning it was a new version of proposals tabled last week by former Attorney General Dominic Grieve, who wants Parliament to get more of a say over Brexit.It would apply in three scenarios: Under these circumstances, the government has said, a minister will make a statement in Parliament, setting out the government's next steps.The government had offered MPs the chance to vote ""on neutral terms"" on this statement. But the amendment backed by the Lords on Monday goes further, saying the statement would have to be approved by MPs.Lord Hailsham also criticised what he called ""disgraceful"" newspaper attacks on Mr Grieve and said it was ""perfectly true"" that he had held talks with other parties in drawing up his amendment.""I make absolutely no apology for that,"" he said.""This is the high court of Parliament, and we are not party hacks.""Lord Hailsham's fellow Tory peer Lord True said ministers had already ""made a serious attempt to compromise"" with the rebels' demands.""People outside Parliament are getting a little bit tired of the parliamentary games,"" he said.""They actually want to know when they're going to get Brexit, when it will be delivered and when it will be done."""
2018-06-18,Tax rise to pay for NHS boost - PM,https://web.archive.org//web/20180618203033/https://www.bbc.com/news/health-44516123,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowTax rises will be needed to pay for the boost in NHS funding announced by the government, the prime minister says.Theresa May conceded the public would pay more, but promised this would be done in a ""fair and balanced"" way.The government also says economic growth and a ""Brexit dividend"" will help cover the costs of the increased spending, which will see NHS England's budget increase by £20bn by 2023.Labour's John McDonnell called the funding model ""not credible"".He - and others - have been critical about whether there will be the savings from Brexit that ministers are claiming.But in a speech in London, Mrs May insisted it would free up money.""Some of the extra funding I am promising today will come from using the money we will no longer spend on our annual membership subscription to the European Union after we have left.""However, she added that ""taxpayers will have to contribute a bit more in a fair and balanced way to support the NHS we all use"".In return, Mrs May said the NHS had to play its part to ensure ""every penny is well spent"".She has asked NHS England boss Simon Stevens to work with senior doctors to come up with a 10-year plan, looking at productivity, staffing and key areas such as mental health and cancer survival.""It must be a plan that tackles waste, reduces bureaucracy and eliminates unacceptable variation,"" Mrs May said.At the weekend, the government announced the NHS England budget would increase by 3.4% a year on average over the next five years.That means by 2023 the budget will be £20bn higher than it is now, once inflation is taken into account.Currently, NHS England spends £114bn a year.But the plan does not include other parts of the wider health budget, such as training, stop-smoking clinics and other preventative services, so the overall ""health"" increase might be lower than 3.4%.The average annual rise since the foundation of the NHS in 1948 is 3.7%.The plan also means more money will also be given to the rest of the UK - about £4bn - although it will be up to the Welsh and Scottish governments to decide how that is spent.Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the boost in funding was agreed with the Treasury on the basis it would come from three sources - Brexit, economic growth and the taxation system.Mr Hunt did not spell out what that could mean for taxes - but to increase the burden of taxation governments can increase tax rates, extend what is included in taxes, such as increasing the goods and services VAT is applied to, or change the thresholds at which tax is charged.Referring to Brexit, Mr Hunt said: ""We won't be paying subscriptions to Brussels... but that alone won't be anything like enough."" The idea of a ""Brexit dividend"" - a term used by Mrs May on Sunday - has attracted criticism.The Conservative chair of the Commons' Health and Social Care Committee, Sarah Wollaston, said the idea of a Brexit dividend was ""tosh"".And Paul Johnson, director of economic think-tank the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), said the only way the rise could be paid for was by an increase in taxes. He said the financial settlement with the EU, plus the UK's commitments to replace EU funding, ""already uses up all of our EU contributions"" for the next few years.It was a significant funding announcement - few at senior levels in the NHS in England disagree with that.But as the dust settles after the weekend, several unanswered questions are still hanging in the air.What about the areas of health which are not covered? What about investment in hospital buildings and equipment? How will it be paid for?Read more from HughMinisters say there will be more details in the Budget - and there will be a desire to keep any rises to a minimum given the Conservative Party manifesto at the last election said its intention was to reduce taxes on businesses and working families.Mrs May made the point that economic growth would mean there was more money available for public services anyway.But she did acknowledge ""the taxpayer will have to contribute a bit more"".The IFS has looked at how much could be brought in and what the options are.The manifesto ruled out a rise in VAT, but that does not exclude extending the range of goods the tax is applied to.A commitment has also been made to reduce corporation tax.Income tax and National Insurance are the two biggest sources of tax revenue to the government.The IFS says adding a penny to the basic rate of income tax would raise £4bn, while 1p on all the main rates of NI would bring in nearly £10bn.Changing the thresholds at which different rates are applied is another option.Work on the plan will get under way almost immediately, with final proposals expected towards the end of the year.Four main areas of the NHS will be looked at:The plan will build on the five-year strategy Mr Stevens set out in 2015.A big part of that was shifting care out of hospitals and into the community.Mrs May is known to be keen to see a specific stress on mental health and improving cancer survival rates this time.In her speech on Monday, the PM recalled her own reliance on the NHS for help when she was diagnosed with type one diabetes, saying: ""I would not be doing the job I am doing today without that support.""Meanwhile, councils have questioned why the funding announcement did not also include more money for social care and public health, which covers everything from stop smoking services to obesity prevention.Both are considered essential to the sustainability of the NHS, but the increase announced only applied to front-line NHS services such as hospitals, GPs and mental health care.Councillor Izzi Seccombe, of the Local Government Association, said: ""Without essential council services, which help people live healthy lives in their own homes and communities, the NHS cannot thrive.""The government said plans to reform the system will be published in the coming months.Read more from NickFollow Nick on Twitter"
2018-06-18,'Pants protest' against Commons row MP,https://web.archive.org//web/20180618203033/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44518706,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAnger over a Conservative MP's decision to block a bill to make ""upskirting"" a criminal offence has manifested itself in an unusual way in Parliament.The entrance to Sir Christopher Chope's Commons office was decorated with women's pants in an apparent protest by Commons staff against his actions.No 10 has now said the government will now bring forward its own legislation.The MP told the BBC he was ""delighted"" by this and suggested he had been ""maligned for motives he never had"". Justice minister Lucy Frazer said by promising a bill before the end of July, ministers were sending a clear message that upskirting - the practice of secretly taking a photo up a woman's skirt - would not be tolerated.Lib Dem Wera Hobhouse, whose own bill was blocked by the Tory MP on Friday, said she was pleased the government had stepped in.Glad my bill has @theresa_may's backing, and that the law will change. I've applied for an Urgent Question this morning, so hopefully there will be some debate today. Will continue to work cross party to get this through! https://t.co/kte1vJHB3eEnd of Twitter post  by @Wera_HobhouseAnd a lawyer for Gina Martin, a victim of upskirting whose campaign helped raise attention to the issue, said it was a ""great day not only for women but for all right-thinking individuals and justice itself"".""The gap in the law that existed was an affront to the English criminal law and it is right and proper that the government has decided to act,"" Ryan Whelan said. Sir Christopher has insisted he does recognise the seriousness of the offence but believed it was wrong to approve a new law without any real debate - as he suggested could have happened on Friday. He told BBC South he had achieved his aim of getting the government to legislate, rather than leaving it to a private member's bill, and this would ensure it happened more quickly. He said Ms Martin ""fully understood"" why he had objected, adding that he found it ""intolerable"" that other people have ascribed motives to him that he never had.""Other people have so cruelly misunderstood what I did,"" he said, describing the criticism he had received on social media as ""a really unpleasant storm"".Sir Christopher has been criticised in the past for effectively stopping private member's bills that would have posthumously pardoned World War Two code-breaker Alan Turing for his 1952 conviction for homosexual activity and scrapped hospital parking charges for carers. ""Any new law needs to be debated,"" he told LBC. ""We don't have legislation by decree - that is what they have in Putin's Russia or Erdogan's Turkey. ""I think it is the moral duty of MPs to stand up for freedom and democracy and not to say just because there seems to be a lot of support for something, it does not need to be questioned.""Mrs Hobhouse's bill was expected to sail through the Commons on Friday, but parliamentary rules mean it required only one MP to shout: ""Object,"" to block its progress.Private members bills are considered on Fridays, when the Commons is often sparsely attended, and depend on government support to progress. Senior Tories have made their displeasure known, former Education Secretary Nicky Morgan saying arguments about parliamentary procedure could not be used to ""explain away this reputation-damaging episode"".

Under current conventions, when one of their number dies or retires, a by-election is held to elect a successor. The contest is open to all those with hereditary titles on the register kept by the clerk of the parliaments.Of the 19 candidates this time around, the 56-year old Lord Snowdon is the only one not to issue a short statement outlining his reasons for standing and his relevant experience.When he was born, in 1961, he was fifth in line to the throne and now sits 19th. He has published a number of books on design and set up a furniture, upholstery and accessories business in 1985. It was reported in 2012 that he had lost executive control of the business. His father sat in the House of Lords for more than 50 years after he was made a peer in 1961, a year after he married the Queen's younger sister. He was one of 10 hereditary peers to accept a life peerage in 1999, allowing them to continue to attend the Lords.If he were to be successful, his son would sit as a crossbencher - with no affiliation to any political party. He is not the only candidate with a royal connection. One of his rivals, Lord Bridges, has been the Queen's personal solicitor since 2002. He will shortly retire as a partner with the law firm Farrer and Co.The result of the ballot will be announced on 4 July. Only the 31 existing hereditary crossbenchers will be permitted to vote in the contest. Labour peer Lord Grocott has led a campaign to ban elections for hereditary peers, which he has called ""beyond ridiculous"". But a bill tabled in 2016 failed to make any headway. A separate election will be held on 17 July to elect a successor to Conservative hereditary peer Lord Glentoran. The list of candidates will be published later this month. "

First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the Sewel convention had been ""ripped up"" by the UK government, saying Scotland had been ""treated with utter contempt"".She said: ""Our interests have been ignored, the voice and views of the Scottish Parliament have been completely cast aside, and I don't think it will be quickly or easily forgotten.""However, Lord Sewel himself has said that the ""major constitutional adjustment"" of Brexit could be justification for the UK government to ""act on its own initiative"", without securing devolved consent.Formerly an Aberdeen district councillor and president of the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, John Sewel was a member of the Scottish Constitutional Convention before becoming a Labour life peer in 1996. He served as a Scotland Office minister under Tony Blair at the time the Scottish Parliament was being set up. He helped pilot the Scotland Act through the parliament, and his name was given to the ""Sewel convention"" - that Westminster would not normally legislate on devolved matters without consent.Lord Sewel told BBC Scotland that nobody had foreseen anything like Brexit at the time the convention was drafted.He said: ""There is that 'not normally' phrase in the convention which does I think clearly recognise the possibility that something quite out of the ordinary would happen, which would mean the UK parliament would be required to legislate in a devolved matter even without the permission of the Scottish Parliament.""I think we're all pretty well agreed that Brexit and leaving the EU is a major constitutional adjustment. We don't live in normal times, in other words.""Both sides can have an argument on this. But I would tend to fall back on the one that the size and the scale of the change that's envisaged and being brought about because of Brexit does put it in a class of its own, and requires the possibility that the UK government would act on its own initiative, without necessarily the approval of the Scottish government.""Despite months of negotiations, Scottish and UK ministers have been unable to come to an agreement over how to set up joint frameworks of rules and regulations after Brexit, using powers currently held in Brussels.Scottish ministers claim Holyrood is the victim of a ""power grab"", while their Whitehall counterparts say the Scottish government is seeking a ""veto"" over UK-wide rules.Scottish Brexit minister Mike Russell said Lord Sewel's point about Brexit being a ""major constitutional adjustment"" made it ""even more important"" that the rules ""protecting the Scottish Parliament's powers"" were followed.During Monday's debate, the SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford told MPs that the Sewel convention was now ""unworkable"", adding that what was ""not normal"" was the ""attack on devolution"" by the UK government.He said the Conservatives had ""stabbed the Scottish parliament and the Scottish people in the back"", accusing the UK government of being ""anti-Scotland"" and calling for the Scottish Secretary David Mundell to quit.Mr Blackford said the UK government should table emergency legislation to ""end the power grab"" and ""resolve this constitutional crisis"".A UK government spokesman said Lord Sewel had confirmed that it was proceeding ""entirely in line with the devolution settlement"", saying ""both we, the Scottish government and now Lord Sewel acknowledge that these are not normal times"".Mr Mundell has also said the that UK government ""followed the spirit and letter of the devolution settlement at every stage"".He said: ""This is not a situation any of us would have chosen. It is not however a crisis, nor is it unforeseen.  ""Whilst the devolution settlements did not predict EU exit, they did explicitly provide that in situations of disagreement the UK parliament may be required to legislate without the consent of the devolved legislature.""Mr Mundell also noted that the bill had been changed from its original form, to reflect a deal with the Welsh government to secure the consent of the parliament there.Lord Sewel said he did not think the move could ""fairly be described as a power grab"", because the Scotland Act states ""quite explicitly that it doesn't affect the power of the UK parliament to make laws for Scotland"".While he conceded that ""the Scottish government has got an argument"" in that many of the powers concerned lie in devolved areas like agriculture and the environment, he said it was not a case of the UK government bidding to ""somehow remove"" responsibilities from Holyrood.The life peer - who resigned from the House of Lords in 2015 after being filmed allegedly taking drugs - said the convention bearing his name has ""worked well"" up until now.He added: ""You get a major crisis, of course - and Brexit is a major crisis - and these things get stretched to their limits. But it's also worth remembering that it is just a convention.""It is not unknown for political parties to seek political advantage over these sort of issues, and there's a fair bit of that going on. It's not a constitutional crisis."""

But she has now been accused of ""damaging"" UKIP after saying Mr Hamilton was unsuitable for the role of assembly commissioner.A spokesman for Ms Jones said she stood by what she said.Ms Jones's objection to the appointment of Mr Hamilton - who remains UKIP Wales leader despite not leading the group in the assembly - triggered a vote in the assembly, which saw the nomination voted down by 31 AMs to 17.Mr Hamilton had been nominated by UKIP for the role on the commission, which administers the assembly.She opposed the nomination because of the Mid and West Wales AM's decision to abstain on the interim anti-harassment policy in the assembly. In an email party secretary Adam Richardson said Ms Jones's speech last week was ""damaging to Mr Hamilton and to the larger party in Wales, which is in desperate need of unity.""He said the resulting press publicity was ""all... quite unnecessary and extremely harmful at a temperamental time"". Ms Jones now faces an emergency disciplinary hearing, which she will be able to attend.A spokesman for Mandy Jones said: ""Mandy Jones stands by what she said in the Chamber last week and has no regrets. The majority agreed with her. ""UKIP has lost nothing - they simply need to field an appropriate candidate for the role."" The North Wales AM joined the assembly last December after UKIP Wales MEP Nathan Gill resigned.She was prevented from joining the UKIP group in the assembly amid a row over her staff - leaving her as an independent."

Labour MP Liz McInnes sent her best wishes to Dimbleby and spoke of her keenness to see a woman at the helm of the show. Fantastic to see so many women in the frame to succeed David Dimbleby. I hope that whoever takes over brings their own style and remains very much their own woman. Best wishes to DD in his semi-retirement #bbcqt https://t.co/FptsxfzrsaEnd of Twitter post  by @LizMcInnes_MPIt is not known how much Dimbleby is paid for his role because Question Time is made by an independent production company, meaning his salary did not appear in last year's list of top paid BBC stars. Recent reports in the Telegraph speculated that he was paid £450,000 per annum by the corporation.Question Time has been on air for nearly 40 years. It was initially chaired by Robin Day (1979-89) and later by Peter Sissons (1989-93)."

But he suggested rebels would not back down in a current row with ministers about how much of a say MPs should get.The EU Withdrawal Bill returns to the Lords and Commons this week, with further rebellions expected.Last week the government avoided a defeat on the bill after agreeing to hold further talks with rebels.They want a bigger role for Parliament, should a final Brexit deal be rejected by MPs, or if no deal is reached - the so-called ""meaningful vote"".Former Attorney General Mr Grieve told BBC One's Sunday Politics that he thought they had agreed MPs could have an ""advisory"" vote, that would not order the government to do anything, but would help people to ""keep calm"" during what would be a ""critical situation"". But after two days of talks, Mr Grieve said a government amendment drawn up to avert a rebellion was changed at the last minute and was now ""valueless"".  He implied rebels would vote against it this week: ""I'm absolutely sure that the group is quite determined that the meaningful vote pledge, which was given to us, has got to be fulfilled.""He added: ""The alternative is that we've all got to sign up to a slavery clause now, saying whatever the government does, when it comes to January, however potentially catastrophic it might be for my constituents and my country, I'm signing in blood now that I will follow over the edge of a cliff, and that I can tell you, I am not prepared to do.""   The government's amendment to the EU (Withdrawal) Bill sets out what must happen in the event of three scenarios: If MPs vote down the UK-EU Brexit deal, if Theresa May announces before 21 January 2019 that no deal has been reached, or if 21st January passes with no deal being struck.Under these circumstances, a minister must make a statement in Parliament setting out their next steps and give MPs an opportunity to vote.However, the vote would be on ""a motion in neutral terms"", merely stating that the House has considered the statement.Rebels had originally wanted the amendment to say that the government must seek the approval of Parliament for its course of action - and that ministers must be directed by MPs and peers.When it was put to him that voting against any Brexit deal at ""the 11th hour"" of negotiations could cause the government to collapse, he replied:  ""We could collapse the government and I can assure you, I wake up at 2am in a cold sweat thinking about the problems that we have put on our shoulders."" Last week another Conservative MP, Tom Tugendhat, told Sky News there was ""going to be a new government"" if MPs rejected the government's Brexit deal.Solicitor General Robert Buckland said that ""however well intentioned"" Mr Grieve's plan had been, his worry was that ""it actually plays badly in the most important negotiation, which is over in Brussels"".It would imply to the EU, he said, that ""there's a third party in this relationship"" - Parliament - which could ""trump whatever the UK government say"". He said ministers would stick with the new amendment for Monday, adding: ""Let's see what the Lords make of it. Of course we have Tuesday to consider matters ahead of the Wednesday vote.""Earlier the prime minister defended her handling of the row.She told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show she had met Tory rebels and ""undertook to consider their concerns"".She admitted there had been ""a debate"" about what a ""meaningful"" vote for Parliament meant: ""I've listened carefully to the concerns, I've put an amendment down which I think balances this issue of the role of Parliament together with the need for us to ensure we don't overturn the decision of the British people.""But she said Parliament ""cannot tie the hands of government in negotiations"".The main purposes of the EU Withdrawal Bill are to end the supremacy of EU law in the UK, and transfer existing EU law into UK law so the same rules and regulations apply on the day after Brexit.But as it passes through Parliament, MPs and peers have been trying to change it, in some cases adding bits on that would change the government's Brexit strategy.The government says the whole row is about a ""hypothetical"" scenario and they are ""confident we will agree a good deal with the EU which Parliament will support""."

That's what the prime minister used to say.She hasn't suddenly started believing that it exists in the depths of some forest somewhere, let alone in the well-manicured back garden of Number 10.But when she used to say that, what Theresa May meant was that the Tories did not want to raise taxes or borrow more to pay for the NHS.She would always remind you that the overall amount of money going in was increasing - but as is well-documented, the demands on the health service have been outpacing the resources available.What's happened is that after many months of argument - remember the cabinet discussing tax rises for health much earlier this year and the ongoing desire of Brexiteers in government to find more cash for the NHS (more of that in a minute) - the prime minister has been convinced by the health secretary and others that the strain on the health service is so acute that there simply is no choice.Jeremy Hunt has been remarkably open about this in recent weeks, and explicitly so today. Theresa May has also made it plain that tax rises are on the table.But what she won't do yet is tell us who will pay, or even rule out any particular taxes going up, down or being frozen to find the money.Be clear, the political decision to find the money has been made. It is even more political to decide from where. And this moment is not just about the NHS, it's about the era when the Tories' priority was paying down the deficit above all else coming to an end.Opposition politicians are rightly pushing for more detail. But this political shift is also awkward for Labour, as the amount promised is more than Labour had proposed during the election - advocating tax rises themselves, it's not clear where else the party can go.It is also the moment when Theresa May seems rather boldly to be willing to try to pull off a rhetorical accounting trick. She repeated her suggestion today that the money for the NHS will come, in part, from the so called ""Brexit dividend"".That is a matter of political presentation, not reality. Yes, after we leave the European Union and complete the transition period (leaving the departure lounge) it is true that we will no longer pay what's basically a membership subscription of £9bn a year.But what Number 10 and especially the Treasury know very well is that as things stand official forecasts suggest that the economy, the overall amount of cash available for the government to spend, will be smaller than if we had stayed in.In the most simple terms, Whitehall number-crunchers predict we will lose more cash wise than we will gain. Now, economic forecasts are often and thoroughly shown to be wrong. But right now, to suggest somehow that Brexit will partly pay for the NHS is at best extremely uncertain, at worst, downright misleading.Remember this though. The Vote Leave campaign repeatedly used a real figure of £350m that they knew gave only part of the picture about the costs of leaving the EU.That drove the Remain side, and plenty of voters, crazy - and there is still anger about it now. But they knew also that every time the other side complained about it, their claims about the NHS were heard by more people.Is Theresa May doing the same? Whether it is designed to cause controversy, or just give her Brexiteer ministers something rhetorical to applaud, she is certainly taking flak. It is one thing for a campaign group to put a pretty slippery gloss on statistics, and that caused enough outrage.It's quite another for the whole machinery of government to do the same."
2018-06-18,Week ahead,https://web.archive.org//web/20180618203033/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-parliaments-44495167,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowIt's back to Brexit again in both Houses of Parliament, after the issue of a ""meaningful vote"" unexpectedly detonated. Soft Brexit/Remainer Tory MPs, led by the former attorney general Dominic Grieve, thought they had a deal with the prime minister on the issue. They had drawn back from rebelling on Tuesday on the promise of a compromise - but then discovered that the government was not offering them what they thought had been conceded.Essentially the issue is about what happens if the divorce talks with the EU run out of time, or fail to deliver a deal, or if MPs reject the proposed deal. Here comes the science bit - concentrate!On Tuesday, MPs were presented with a Lords amendment that would have given the power to MPs to direct the government's next steps in those contingencies. The government offered a replacement amendment in the Commons (an ""amendment in lieu"" in parliamentary jargon) which gave MPs a vote on the final deal, but, crucially, did not give them the opportunity to direct the government's future strategy - what they would get instead would be a statement within 28 days, setting out how the government ""proposes to proceed in relation to negotiations for the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the EU"".Dominic Grieve responded with his own amendment, which was similar to the Lords proposal, but put stronger conditions on MPs being given the power to direct the government. He set out three options which would only kick in three particular scenarios: Having pulled back from rebellion he was expecting the government to concede most of these powers, but it was not to be - and now his Lords ally Lord Hailsham (the former cabinet minister Douglass Hogg) is to put forward his proposals in the Lords, with the aim of replacing the amendment the government won in the Commons, and kicking it back to MPs. The point is that Mr Grieve and his allies would then have a chance to press it to a vote - and quite possibly win.  Both Houses have to agree on the final form of legislation before it can become law, and this intricate process - ""ping pong"" in Westminster-speak - is how MPs and peers reach an agreed wording. So on Monday we will have the Lords votes on the changes made by the Commons. Peers will probably accept most of them, but the Hailsham amendment looks set fair to be accepted (the previous version was passed by a majority of 91 votes) and it will then be kicked back to the Commons, for consideration on Wednesday.Will it win there? The government has a narrow majority with its DUP allies, but if the group around Mr Grieve vote with Labour and the other opposition parties, they would have a majority. Unless some Labour MPs broke ranks and voted with the government, or abstained. And there is a contingent of pro Brexit MPs and MPs from strongly Leave constituencies who may well do so. The arithmetic looks very tight, and the rival sets of party whips will doubtless be working very hard to minimise the number of rebels on their side. It's worth remembering that the Grieve group, unlike the Brexiteers, are not bloodied in rebellion from years of backbench insurgency - so it will be interesting to see if the iron has entered their souls, or whether they can be persuaded to relent. In the end it might even come down to MPs being taken ill or stuck on a train - but unless a new compromise is struck over the weekend, and the implication of bad faith around the previous deal may make that hard to do - we could be in for a week of drama which could prove highly destabilising to the government.Something else to watch out for is an effort to secure an Estimates Day debate on the Defence Budget; debates on these days are under a procedure which allows detailed discussion of money issues, and both the Defence Select Committee and the Public Accounts Committee are extremely concerned about the state of the Ministry of Defence finances. As luck would have it, members of both were recently together at Rossyth, for a visit to the new aircraft carrier, HMS Queen Elizabeth II, and the rumour is that a coordinated move to get the issue onto the floor of the Commons has been cooked up. Here's my rundown of the week ahead:The Commons opens (2.30 pm) with Housing, Communities and Local Government questions - and any statements or urgent questions will follow at 3.30 pm. Then comes the Emergency Debate secured by the SNP leader, Ian Blackford, on the Sewel Convention - the convention that Westminster seeks ""legislative consent"" for new laws touching on the devolved governments of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.  This follows the passage of amendments to the EU (Withdrawal) Bill on which EU powers will and will not be passed to the devolved parliaments, which were opposed by the Scottish Parliament. After  last week's furious scenes, this could provide another flashpoint between the SNP and, in particular, the Scottish Tory MPs and the government whips - the whips have developed a habit of standing close to the SNP benches and heckling their MPs, which is much resented. MPs then deal with Lords amendments to the Automated and Electric Vehicles Bill - in what should be a pretty brief encounter, before moving on to votes on a statutory instrument on the Draft European Union (Definition of Treaties) (Canada Trade Agreement) Order and European Documents relating to EU Trade Agreements: EU-Japan Economic Partnership Agreement. And after that there is a general debate on how the NHS and other public services deal with acquired brain injuries.In Westminster Hall (4.30 pm) MPs debate e-petition 209433: ""Give the electorate a referendum on the abolition of the House of Lords - the House of Lords is a place of patronage where unelected and unaccountable individuals hold a disproportionate amount of influence and power which can be used to frustrate the elected representatives of the people."" The petition attracted 168,755 signatures.My committee pick is the Transport Committee hearing (4.45pm) on Rail timetable changes - when MPs will question top executives from GTR, Arriva Rail North, London North Western and Network Rail. It was announced on Friday that Charles Horton is to resign as chief executive of Govia Thameslink Railway, following months of controversy over delays and cancellations to services. Bring popcorn. In the Lords, after a half hour question time at 2.30pm, peers embark on their consideration of Commons amendments to the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill  (see above).MPs kick off (at 11.30 am) with Health and Social Care questions, after which the Conservative Craig Mackinlay presents a Ten Minute Rule Bill to give Gibraltar an MP (this had been due to be debated some months ago, and was rescheduled). Then comes a Labour Opposition Day Debate on a motion (or motions) to be announced.In Westminster Hall, the opening debate (9.30am) is on Romania: the member state which will hold the EU Presidency next year, and therefore has a crucial brokering role in the final Brexit negotiations. The debate will be opened by the Conservative, Bob Blackman, who believes Romania is very keen to help, and will want to extend bilateral arrangements with the UK, post Brexit. He also wants to discuss Romanian concerns about Russian activity in the Black Sea.Labour's Helen Goodman (2.30pm) leads a debate on geothermal energy, which she says has a huge potential to provide a carbon free energy source - including in former coal communities, where decommissioned mine shafts can be used. But, she says, it does not feature in the government's energy strategy. Her aim in this debate is to raise the profile and press ministers to take the opportunities seriously.My committee corridor pick is the International Development hearing (10am) on the humanitarian situation in Gaza, with witnesses from the UN, followed by the Foreign Office and International Development and minister, Alistair Burt.In the Lords (2.30pm) peers debate the detail of the Rating (Property in Common Occupation) and Council Tax (Empty Dwellings) Bill - the measure that will allow local councils to increase the tax on empty homes. Then there is a short debate on encouraging a recovery in the population of bees and other pollinators.The Commons begins (11.30am) with half an hour of Northern Ireland questions, before moving on to the high noon of Prime Minister's Question time.The day's Ten Minute Rule Bill, from the SNP's Martin Docherty-Hughes aims to create an Armed Forces Representative Body. Time has then been set aside to consider Lords amendments to the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill (see above) and there will be a general debate on Nato.One thing to keep an eye on is a possible statement from a health minister on the findings of Bishop James Jones' independent inquiry into deaths at the Gosport Memorial Hospital. The inquiry was commissioned during the coalition years, following concerns about the over-use of morphine on patients. Look out for Lib Dem former health minister Norman Lamb...In Westminster Hall, there are debates on the UN report on the convention on the rights of persons with disabilities (9.30am-11am);  the UK constitutional machinery and the frameworks for intergovernmental cooperation (2.30pm-4pm); UK and Polish war reparations against Germany (4pm-4.30pm) and insecure work and the gig economy (4.30pm-5.30pm). On the committee corridor, the Housing, Communities and Local Government Committee (9.30am) takes evidence one year on, on local authority support for Grenfell Tower survivors - there are witnesses from Grenfell United, the North Kensington Law Centre, Councillor Elizabeth Campbell, the Leader of Kensington and Chelsea Council, and Nick Hurd, the minister of state for Policing and Fire Service, with responsibility for Grenfell Tower victims work, at the Home Office. And meanwhile, there's a lively session in prospect, when arch europhile MEP Guy ""the Hoff"" Verhofstadt, the coordinator and chair of the European Parliament Brexit Steering Group, gives evidence to the Brexit Committee on the progress of the UK's negotiations on EU withdrawal (9.15 am) - and he turns up again in the afternoon, before the Home Affairs Committee (2.30pm) to talk about Post-Brexit migration policy. The European Parliament has to sign off on the EU side of Britain's divorce deal, so his views will matter.In the Lords (3pm), the main event is the second reading of the Courts and Tribunals (Judiciary and Functions of Staff) Bill, which seeks to remove restrictions on how judges can be deployed, so they can hear a wider range of cases. The Commons opens (9.30am) with Digital, Culture, Media and Sport questions, followed by questions to the Attorney General (10.10am) and the weekly Business Questions to the Leader of the House. The main debates are on backbench motions on the importance of refugee family reunion - the SNP's Angus Brendan MacNeil proposes a motion welcoming the fact that the Refugees (Family Reunion) (No.2) Bill was given its second reading without opposition on 16 March 2018, and calling on the government to support the bill.Then Labour MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle has a motion on the future of the Erasmus+ student exchange scheme, after 2020, calling on the government to ensure continued UK access, after Brexit.In the Lords (11am) question time marks national Yoga Day with a query on the benefits of yoga for obese school children. Peers then debate the support available to carers and the Carers Action Plan 2018 - 2020; and the implications for the UKs future trade relations following the failure to reach agreement at the G7 Summit in Canada. And then they discuss the contribution of the armed forces reserves to national security. Neither House sits on Friday 22 June."

But in the process he's angered anti-war activists and critics of British and Western foreign policy, who claim he's been biased against them. ""Christmas Day, Eid day, Easter Day, Cup final day, early hours of the morning, in the middle of the night - this man is on my case,"" says George Galloway, the former Labour and Respect Party MP. ""And it doesn't take an Einstein to work out he's not tending this garden with loving care or to make it look as nice as it can look. It's the opposite."" The subject of Galloway's ire is a prolific Wikipedia editor who goes by the name ""Philip Cross"". He's been the subject of a huge debate on the internet encyclopaedia - one of the world's most popular websites - and also on Twitter. And he's been accused of bias for interacting, sometimes negatively, with some of the people whose Wikipedia pages he's edited. The Philip Cross account was created at precisely 18:48 GMT on 26 October 2004. Since then, he's made more than 130,000 edits to more 30,000 pages. That's a substantial amount, but not hugely unusual - it's not enough edits, for example, to put him in the top 300 editors on Wikipedia. But it's what he edits which has preoccupied anti-war politicians and journalists. In his top 10 most-edited pages are the jazz musician Duke Ellington, The Sun newspaper, and Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre. But also in that top 10 are a number of vocal critics of American and British foreign policy: the journalist John Pilger, Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn and Corbyn's director of strategy, Seamus Milne.His critics also say that Philip Cross has made favourable edits to pages about public figures who are supportive of Western military intervention in the Middle East. He's recently caught the attention of bloggers and has been the subject of stories in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz and Russian state-owned outlets Sputnik and RT. There have been allegations on social media - all unproven - that he's a government agent, employed by rich and powerful media interests, or is a mainstream journalist with an obsessive hobby.You may also be interested in:""His edits are remorselessly targeted at people who oppose the Iraq war, who've opposed the subsequent intervention wars … in Libya and Syria, and people who criticise Israel,"" Galloway says.

More on this storyFor example, a sentence where Galloway criticised the Labour Party as ""Tony Blair's lie machine"" was removed, with Cross citing ""partial repetition, poor source"". In another case, Cross removed links to lurid tabloid headlines about Galloway's private life. In addition, many of the edits were simply grammatically or stylistic.  At one point Cross noted: ""It helps the article if each sentence or paragraph does not begin with 'Galloway' or 'He'.""Wikipedia, which was launched in 2001, relies on volunteers to write and edit entries. Wikipedians have developed an enormous set of rules and procedures guiding the development of a site which now has more than 5.5m articles in English.In addition to his Wikipedia edits, Philip Cross has a Twitter account which he has used to interact with Galloway and other politicians and journalists. In one tweet, for instance, he called a group of anti-war activists ""goons"". That raised claims of a conflict of interest, which is potentially against Wikipedia guidelines. The account is currently subject to a review process run by Wikipedia volunteers, although Philip Cross has promised to stop editing Galloway's entry for an ""indeterminate length of time regardless of any decision"".The Wikimedia Foundation - which established and funds Wikipedia - declined an interview request, but said in a statement:""Independent volunteer editors consistently monitor Wikipedia, often aided by technology, to ensure its articles remain neutral and well-sourced for the hundreds of millions of people who rely on it every month. ""If repeat violations to Wikipedia policies do occur, volunteers have a variety of mechanisms to draw from, including issuing warnings and blockings, to address content and behaviour that does not meet Wikipedia standards."" On Twitter, Wikipedia's co-founder, Jimmy Wales, rejected claims that Philip Cross is making entries biased.Because as far as I can tell so far, those complaints are so wrong as to be risible.

2018-06-18,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20180618203033/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-44470777,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe claim: The UK's 20-year devolution convention has been ""ripped up"".Reality Check verdict: The convention has been undermined but there is no legal reason why the UK government cannot ignore the Scottish Parliament over Brexit. Scotland's first minister says the passage of the UK's key Brexit legislation without the consent of the Scottish Parliament has ""ripped up the 20-year-old devolution convention"" in the UK. Is she right?Ms Sturgeon's tweet came after the House of Commons spent less than 20 minutes debating the EU Withdrawal Bill's impact on devolution. The SNP said that showed ""contempt for Scottish democracy"", with the party's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, leading a walk-out of his MPs during Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday.The row centres on a so-called ""power grab"", with the Scottish government accusing Westminster of keeping some powers for itself that should go to the Scottish Parliament at Holyrood, after Brexit.  The UK government says the ""temporary"" move will allow the same rules and regulations to remain in place across the whole of the UK in 24 key areas, such as agriculture, fisheries and food labelling.And it points out that the vast majority of the 153 areas where policy in devolved areas is currently decided in Brussels will go directly to the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly, meaning both will have considerably more powers after Brexit than they do now. Months of talks have failed to reach a deal - although the Welsh government dropped its opposition after changes were made that would put a limit on how long the UK government would keep the powers.Last month, the Scottish Parliament voted overwhelmingly to refuse consent for the Brexit bill, with the SNP being joined by Labour, the Greens and Liberal Democrat MSPs and only the Conservatives voting against. The UK government pressed on regardless - so how was it able to do so? When the devolved Scottish Parliament was set up in 1999, it was handed control over many policy areas such as health and education that had previously been decided at Westminster.However, an agreement signed by the two governments in 2001 stated that ""the United Kingdom Parliament retains authority to legislate on any issue, whether devolved or not"" and that it was ""ultimately for parliament to decide what use to make of that power"". It also stated that the UK government ""will proceed in accordance with the convention that the UK Parliament would not normally legislate with regard to devolved matters except with the agreement of the devolved legislature"". This agreement was inserted into the Scotland Act in 2016, which was drawn up after the independence referendum two years earlier.The word ""normally"" is, of course, an important caveat that is open to different interpretations - is Brexit ""normal"", for example?Scottish Secretary David Mundell said these were not normal times and a failure to proceed with the bill would jeopardise businesses across the UK.He accused the Scottish government of wanting a veto over arrangements that would apply to the whole of the UK and insisted the UK government ""followed the spirit and letter of the devolution settlement at every stage"" despite the failure to secure consent.  Consent is sought through something known as the Sewel Convention, named after former Labour government minister Lord Sewel, which, in effect, allowed the UK government to ask MSPs for permission to change the law in an area that is devolved to Holyrood. Similar conventions apply in both Wales and Northern Ireland. Until Brexit came along, the Scottish Parliament had only once before refused to give its consent - over some aspects of the Welfare Reform Bill in 2011, which resulted in the Scottish government introducing its own legislation to resolve the row. So Ms Sturgeon is correct to say that pushing through the EU Withdrawal Bill without the consent of the Scottish Parliament means that the long-standing convention has, in effect, been ""ripped up"".However, as its name suggests, it is merely a convention and there is no legal requirement for the UK government to seek Holyrood's permission - or to respect its decision if it says ""no"". This was confirmed by the Supreme Court last year, when it ruled on the case brought by Gina Miller about the triggering of Article 50, which started the Brexit process. Judges ruled that the Sewel Convention was not a legally enforceable rule despite being inserted into the Scotland Act.This meant that the Scottish Parliament did not have a veto over Article 50 or, by extension, the EU Withdrawal Bill. Regardless, ignoring the result of the Scottish Parliament vote was sure to provoke fury from the SNP, with Ms Sturgeon warning that ""the decision to act without our consent, and the manner of doing it, will not be forgotten"".Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questionsFollow us on Twitter"
2018-06-18,Game on?,https://web.archive.org//web/20180618203033/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-44497225,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe world of political predictions is a mug's game but I'm going to call this one and I'm prepared to eat humble pie on 4 July.I was told on Twitter this week that stories about the leadership of Plaid Cymru were as a result of ""media stirring"".Here is my case for the defence and why I think there will be a three-way battle for the top job. Much was made on Tuesday of Rhun ap Iorwerth's remarks denying any plan to challenge Leanne Wood, but here's some context. Plaid have an official window whereby any member of the assembly group can put their names forward for the leadership. It comes around every two years and it's open for another three weeks.The party also have a weekly news briefing with journalists, each member of the group taking it in turn to appear. What an opportune time it was to ask Mr ap Iorwerth about his intentions. ""No plans to challenge"" he said, as question after question honed in on the same subject. What else could he say? Some took it to be a categorical assurance that he wouldn't challenge Leanne Wood. ""Plans"" change, of course, and I suspect they changed 24 hours later.That's when an emboldened Leanne Wood said she would ""welcome"" a challenge.  In a BBC interview she mentioned Rhun ap Iorwerth by name and her opposition to the Wylfa Newydd nuclear power station became evident.  It's a project he's supporting. It all amounted to what looks like a ""put up or shut up"" strategy and opened the door for ""plans"" to change.Those close to Rhun ap Iorwerth say he's coming under increasing pressure to stand; that was Wednesday night, by the way.On Thursday morning sources close to Adam Price were saying the same thing. He's got the backing of councillors and constituency parties in Carmarthenshire already. But does he want it? Mr Price, currently on paternity leave, hasn't come under the same amount of scrutiny as his potential rivals this week. In 2016 he was described by MP Jonathan Edwards as a ""once in a generation politician … an X factor politician"", labelled by some the ""Mab Darogan"" - prophetic son - of Welsh folklore. Mr Edwards, as it happened, led Ms Wood's leadership campaign in 2012. It could be awkward.So here's what will happen next - a drip, drip of stories about calls for both Rhun ap Iorwerth and Adam Price to stand.  Watch out for something along the lines of ""it's impossible to ignore what the members want"" or ""because Leanne has welcomed a challenge"".  Three AMs have already signed a letter urging colleagues to stand.It gives the challengers a way in to the contest, and the incumbent will at least have clarity about her position at the end of the process.Behind the scenes I suspect it's game on already."
2018-06-18,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20180618203033/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks have now moved on to future relations - after agreement was reached on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree within six months on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide, but first let's go back to the basics...It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.1% in the first three months of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.4%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand near a 40-year year low of 4.2%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 4.2% in the year to March 2018, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May is seeking to put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. If passed, it will end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, is supposed to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each playing roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanAn agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement wopuld only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.The full details are not yet known but UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72.We don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pounds buy fewer euros. A slump in the value of the dollar means the exchange rate with the pound is pretty close to where it was before the referendum.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.The UK has proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.A method for calculating the bill has been agreed, but the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more.The question of how and when payments will be made still needs to resolved, but it will be a schedule lasting for many years to come, and it is highly unlikely that anyone will ever be able to give an exact figure for the size of the divorce bill.UK sources say it will be up to £40bn, but some EU sources expect it to be higher than that. No-one can say for sure, and both sides want to keep it that way.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 6.5% in 2016 to 2.7% in 2017, according to the Halifax. It said the slowdown was driven by a squeeze on real wage growth.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-06-18,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180618203033/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to £840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

On the two previous occasions in 1970 and February 1974 the PM and the party lost office. While there is no other conceivable administration in the new parliament other than a Conservative-led one, it remains to be seen whether the PM will retain her position. However, so long as the Conservatives can reach an accommodation with the DUP they will have a working majority in the House of Commons.

And negotiations have been taking place over the terms of its departure.But there is an ongoing row about what happens if Parliament votes to reject the final deal reached between the two sides - or if no deal is reached.One side says Parliament should intervene to prevent the UK from ""crashing out"" of the EU without a deal - but critics say the prospect of this happening would undermine the UK's negotiating hand.Last week, Theresa May avoided defeat on the issue - but rebels said they were not happy with the concessions they had been offered in return for not voting against the government.Now, peers have backed an amendment from former Conservative cabinet minister Lord Hailsham, which goes further than the government's proposals on how much power MPs could get.The 119 majority was 28 more than the last time peers voted on the so-called ""meaningful vote"" issue.Lord Hailsham, who described Brexit as a ""national calamity"" in his speech, said his amendment represented what had been agreed ""in good faith"" by the would-be Tory rebels, led by former Attorney General Dominic Grieve, and Downing Street last week.""It's a matter of honour,"" he said.He also said his proposals were in the ""national interest"", adding: ""In order to safeguard our nation's vital interests, in the event that there be no deal on the table, Parliament should have the authority to intervene.""Lord Hailsham described his amendment as ""Grieve Two"", meaning it was a new version of proposals tabled last week by former Attorney General Dominic Grieve, who wants Parliament to get more of a say over Brexit.It would apply in three scenarios: Under these circumstances, the government has said, a minister will make a statement in Parliament, setting out the government's next steps.The government had offered MPs the chance to vote ""on neutral terms"" on this statement. But the amendment backed by the Lords on Monday goes further, saying the statement would have to be approved by MPs.Lord Hailsham also criticised what he called ""disgraceful"" newspaper attacks on Mr Grieve and said it was ""perfectly true"" that he had held talks with other parties in drawing up his amendment.""I make absolutely no apology for that,"" he said.""This is the high court of Parliament, and we are not party hacks.""Lord Hailsham's fellow Tory peer Lord True said ministers had already ""made a serious attempt to compromise"" with the rebels' demands.""People outside Parliament are getting a little bit tired of the parliamentary games,"" he said.""They actually want to know when they're going to get Brexit, when it will be delivered and when it will be done."""
2018-06-19,Tax rise to pay for NHS boost - PM,https://web.archive.org//web/20180618203033/https://www.bbc.com/news/health-44516123,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowTax rises will be needed to pay for the boost in NHS funding announced by the government, the prime minister says.Theresa May conceded the public would pay more, but promised this would be done in a ""fair and balanced"" way.The government also says economic growth and a ""Brexit dividend"" will help cover the costs of the increased spending, which will see NHS England's budget increase by £20bn by 2023.Labour's John McDonnell called the funding model ""not credible"".He - and others - have been critical about whether there will be the savings from Brexit that ministers are claiming.But in a speech in London, Mrs May insisted it would free up money.""Some of the extra funding I am promising today will come from using the money we will no longer spend on our annual membership subscription to the European Union after we have left.""However, she added that ""taxpayers will have to contribute a bit more in a fair and balanced way to support the NHS we all use"".In return, Mrs May said the NHS had to play its part to ensure ""every penny is well spent"".She has asked NHS England boss Simon Stevens to work with senior doctors to come up with a 10-year plan, looking at productivity, staffing and key areas such as mental health and cancer survival.""It must be a plan that tackles waste, reduces bureaucracy and eliminates unacceptable variation,"" Mrs May said.At the weekend, the government announced the NHS England budget would increase by 3.4% a year on average over the next five years.That means by 2023 the budget will be £20bn higher than it is now, once inflation is taken into account.Currently, NHS England spends £114bn a year.But the plan does not include other parts of the wider health budget, such as training, stop-smoking clinics and other preventative services, so the overall ""health"" increase might be lower than 3.4%.The average annual rise since the foundation of the NHS in 1948 is 3.7%.The plan also means more money will also be given to the rest of the UK - about £4bn - although it will be up to the Welsh and Scottish governments to decide how that is spent.Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the boost in funding was agreed with the Treasury on the basis it would come from three sources - Brexit, economic growth and the taxation system.Mr Hunt did not spell out what that could mean for taxes - but to increase the burden of taxation governments can increase tax rates, extend what is included in taxes, such as increasing the goods and services VAT is applied to, or change the thresholds at which tax is charged.Referring to Brexit, Mr Hunt said: ""We won't be paying subscriptions to Brussels... but that alone won't be anything like enough."" The idea of a ""Brexit dividend"" - a term used by Mrs May on Sunday - has attracted criticism.The Conservative chair of the Commons' Health and Social Care Committee, Sarah Wollaston, said the idea of a Brexit dividend was ""tosh"".And Paul Johnson, director of economic think-tank the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), said the only way the rise could be paid for was by an increase in taxes. He said the financial settlement with the EU, plus the UK's commitments to replace EU funding, ""already uses up all of our EU contributions"" for the next few years.It was a significant funding announcement - few at senior levels in the NHS in England disagree with that.But as the dust settles after the weekend, several unanswered questions are still hanging in the air.What about the areas of health which are not covered? What about investment in hospital buildings and equipment? How will it be paid for?Read more from HughMinisters say there will be more details in the Budget - and there will be a desire to keep any rises to a minimum given the Conservative Party manifesto at the last election said its intention was to reduce taxes on businesses and working families.Mrs May made the point that economic growth would mean there was more money available for public services anyway.But she did acknowledge ""the taxpayer will have to contribute a bit more"".The IFS has looked at how much could be brought in and what the options are.The manifesto ruled out a rise in VAT, but that does not exclude extending the range of goods the tax is applied to.A commitment has also been made to reduce corporation tax.Income tax and National Insurance are the two biggest sources of tax revenue to the government.The IFS says adding a penny to the basic rate of income tax would raise £4bn, while 1p on all the main rates of NI would bring in nearly £10bn.Changing the thresholds at which different rates are applied is another option.Work on the plan will get under way almost immediately, with final proposals expected towards the end of the year.Four main areas of the NHS will be looked at:The plan will build on the five-year strategy Mr Stevens set out in 2015.A big part of that was shifting care out of hospitals and into the community.Mrs May is known to be keen to see a specific stress on mental health and improving cancer survival rates this time.In her speech on Monday, the PM recalled her own reliance on the NHS for help when she was diagnosed with type one diabetes, saying: ""I would not be doing the job I am doing today without that support.""Meanwhile, councils have questioned why the funding announcement did not also include more money for social care and public health, which covers everything from stop smoking services to obesity prevention.Both are considered essential to the sustainability of the NHS, but the increase announced only applied to front-line NHS services such as hospitals, GPs and mental health care.Councillor Izzi Seccombe, of the Local Government Association, said: ""Without essential council services, which help people live healthy lives in their own homes and communities, the NHS cannot thrive.""The government said plans to reform the system will be published in the coming months.Read more from NickFollow Nick on Twitter"

Justice minister Lucy Frazer said by promising a bill before the end of July, ministers were sending a clear message that upskirting - the practice of secretly taking a photo up a woman's skirt - would not be tolerated.Lib Dem Wera Hobhouse, whose own bill was blocked by the Tory MP on Friday, said she was pleased the government had stepped in.Glad my bill has @theresa_may's backing, and that the law will change. I've applied for an Urgent Question this morning, so hopefully there will be some debate today. Will continue to work cross party to get this through! https://t.co/kte1vJHB3eEnd of Twitter post  by @Wera_HobhouseAnd a lawyer for Gina Martin, a victim of upskirting whose campaign helped raise attention to the issue, said it was a ""great day not only for women but for all right-thinking individuals and justice itself"".""The gap in the law that existed was an affront to the English criminal law and it is right and proper that the government has decided to act,"" Ryan Whelan said. Sir Christopher has insisted he does recognise the seriousness of the offence but believed it was wrong to approve a new law without any real debate - as he suggested could have happened on Friday. He told BBC South he had achieved his aim of getting the government to legislate, rather than leaving it to a private member's bill, and this would ensure it happened more quickly. He said Ms Martin ""fully understood"" why he had objected, adding that he found it ""intolerable"" that other people have ascribed motives to him that he never had.""Other people have so cruelly misunderstood what I did,"" he said, describing the criticism he had received on social media as ""a really unpleasant storm"".Sir Christopher has been criticised in the past for effectively stopping private member's bills that would have posthumously pardoned World War Two code-breaker Alan Turing for his 1952 conviction for homosexual activity and scrapped hospital parking charges for carers. ""Any new law needs to be debated,"" he told LBC. ""We don't have legislation by decree - that is what they have in Putin's Russia or Erdogan's Turkey. ""I think it is the moral duty of MPs to stand up for freedom and democracy and not to say just because there seems to be a lot of support for something, it does not need to be questioned.""Mrs Hobhouse's bill was expected to sail through the Commons on Friday, but parliamentary rules mean it required only one MP to shout: ""Object,"" to block its progress.Private members bills are considered on Fridays, when the Commons is often sparsely attended, and depend on government support to progress. Senior Tories have made their displeasure known, former Education Secretary Nicky Morgan saying arguments about parliamentary procedure could not be used to ""explain away this reputation-damaging episode"". Writing in Conservative Home, she said she and most others in the party had been ""appalled"" by his behaviour.""It proves to everyone beyond the Westminster bubble that the work so many of us are engaged in, and have supported - to bring the Conservative Party into the modern era - remains uncompleted,"" she wrote. What is the current law?What are the limitations of the current situation in England and Wales?What does the new law propose?"
2018-06-19,Queen's nephew seeks election to Lords,https://web.archive.org//web/20180618203033/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44522954,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe Queen's nephew, who is 19th in line to the throne, is standing for election to the House of Lords.Lord Snowdon, the son of the late Princess Margaret and photographer Antony Armstrong-Jones, is one of 19 candidates for the ballot on 3 July.A furniture designer and former UK chairman of Christie's auctioneers, David Armstrong-Jones inherited his father's title on his death last year.Next month's ballot was triggered by the retirement of Lord Baldwin.There are 92 hereditary peers in the Lords, who stayed in the upper chamber after the remainder were expelled in 1999 in changes carried out by the government of Tony Blair. Under current conventions, when one of their number dies or retires, a by-election is held to elect a successor. The contest is open to all those with hereditary titles on the register kept by the clerk of the parliaments.Of the 19 candidates this time around, the 56-year old Lord Snowdon is the only one not to issue a short statement outlining his reasons for standing and his relevant experience.When he was born, in 1961, he was fifth in line to the throne and now sits 19th. He has published a number of books on design and set up a furniture, upholstery and accessories business in 1985. It was reported in 2012 that he had lost executive control of the business. His father sat in the House of Lords for more than 50 years after he was made a peer in 1961, a year after he married the Queen's younger sister. He was one of 10 hereditary peers to accept a life peerage in 1999, allowing them to continue to attend the Lords.If he were to be successful, his son would sit as a crossbencher - with no affiliation to any political party. He is not the only candidate with a royal connection. One of his rivals, Lord Bridges, has been the Queen's personal solicitor since 2002. He will shortly retire as a partner with the law firm Farrer and Co.The result of the ballot will be announced on 4 July. Only the 31 existing hereditary crossbenchers will be permitted to vote in the contest. Labour peer Lord Grocott has led a campaign to ban elections for hereditary peers, which he has called ""beyond ridiculous"". But a bill tabled in 2016 failed to make any headway. A separate election will be held on 17 July to elect a successor to Conservative hereditary peer Lord Glentoran. The list of candidates will be published later this month. "

First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the Sewel convention had been ""ripped up"" by the UK government, saying Scotland had been ""treated with utter contempt"".She said: ""Our interests have been ignored, the voice and views of the Scottish Parliament have been completely cast aside, and I don't think it will be quickly or easily forgotten.""However, Lord Sewel himself has said that the ""major constitutional adjustment"" of Brexit could be justification for the UK government to ""act on its own initiative"", without securing devolved consent.Formerly an Aberdeen district councillor and president of the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, John Sewel was a member of the Scottish Constitutional Convention before becoming a Labour life peer in 1996. He served as a Scotland Office minister under Tony Blair at the time the Scottish Parliament was being set up. He helped pilot the Scotland Act through the parliament, and his name was given to the ""Sewel convention"" - that Westminster would not normally legislate on devolved matters without consent.Lord Sewel told BBC Scotland that nobody had foreseen anything like Brexit at the time the convention was drafted.He said: ""There is that 'not normally' phrase in the convention which does I think clearly recognise the possibility that something quite out of the ordinary would happen, which would mean the UK parliament would be required to legislate in a devolved matter even without the permission of the Scottish Parliament.""I think we're all pretty well agreed that Brexit and leaving the EU is a major constitutional adjustment. We don't live in normal times, in other words.""Both sides can have an argument on this. But I would tend to fall back on the one that the size and the scale of the change that's envisaged and being brought about because of Brexit does put it in a class of its own, and requires the possibility that the UK government would act on its own initiative, without necessarily the approval of the Scottish government.""Despite months of negotiations, Scottish and UK ministers have been unable to come to an agreement over how to set up joint frameworks of rules and regulations after Brexit, using powers currently held in Brussels.Scottish ministers claim Holyrood is the victim of a ""power grab"", while their Whitehall counterparts say the Scottish government is seeking a ""veto"" over UK-wide rules.Scottish Brexit minister Mike Russell said Lord Sewel's point about Brexit being a ""major constitutional adjustment"" made it ""even more important"" that the rules ""protecting the Scottish Parliament's powers"" were followed.During Monday's debate, the SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford told MPs that the Sewel convention was now ""unworkable"", adding that what was ""not normal"" was the ""attack on devolution"" by the UK government.He said the Conservatives had ""stabbed the Scottish parliament and the Scottish people in the back"", accusing the UK government of being ""anti-Scotland"" and calling for the Scottish Secretary David Mundell to quit.Mr Blackford said the UK government should table emergency legislation to ""end the power grab"" and ""resolve this constitutional crisis"".A UK government spokesman said Lord Sewel had confirmed that it was proceeding ""entirely in line with the devolution settlement"", saying ""both we, the Scottish government and now Lord Sewel acknowledge that these are not normal times"".Mr Mundell has also said the that UK government ""followed the spirit and letter of the devolution settlement at every stage"".He said: ""This is not a situation any of us would have chosen. It is not however a crisis, nor is it unforeseen.  ""Whilst the devolution settlements did not predict EU exit, they did explicitly provide that in situations of disagreement the UK parliament may be required to legislate without the consent of the devolved legislature.""Mr Mundell also noted that the bill had been changed from its original form, to reflect a deal with the Welsh government to secure the consent of the parliament there.Lord Sewel said he did not think the move could ""fairly be described as a power grab"", because the Scotland Act states ""quite explicitly that it doesn't affect the power of the UK parliament to make laws for Scotland"".While he conceded that ""the Scottish government has got an argument"" in that many of the powers concerned lie in devolved areas like agriculture and the environment, he said it was not a case of the UK government bidding to ""somehow remove"" responsibilities from Holyrood.The life peer - who resigned from the House of Lords in 2015 after being filmed allegedly taking drugs - said the convention bearing his name has ""worked well"" up until now.He added: ""You get a major crisis, of course - and Brexit is a major crisis - and these things get stretched to their limits. But it's also worth remembering that it is just a convention.""It is not unknown for political parties to seek political advantage over these sort of issues, and there's a fair bit of that going on. It's not a constitutional crisis."""

But she has now been accused of ""damaging"" UKIP after saying Mr Hamilton was unsuitable for the role of assembly commissioner.A spokesman for Ms Jones said she stood by what she said.Ms Jones's objection to the appointment of Mr Hamilton - who remains UKIP Wales leader despite not leading the group in the assembly - triggered a vote in the assembly, which saw the nomination voted down by 31 AMs to 17.Mr Hamilton had been nominated by UKIP for the role on the commission, which administers the assembly.She opposed the nomination because of the Mid and West Wales AM's decision to abstain on the interim anti-harassment policy in the assembly. In an email party secretary Adam Richardson said Ms Jones's speech last week was ""damaging to Mr Hamilton and to the larger party in Wales, which is in desperate need of unity.""He said the resulting press publicity was ""all... quite unnecessary and extremely harmful at a temperamental time"". Ms Jones now faces an emergency disciplinary hearing, which she will be able to attend.A spokesman for Mandy Jones said: ""Mandy Jones stands by what she said in the Chamber last week and has no regrets. The majority agreed with her. ""UKIP has lost nothing - they simply need to field an appropriate candidate for the role."" The North Wales AM joined the assembly last December after UKIP Wales MEP Nathan Gill resigned.She was prevented from joining the UKIP group in the assembly amid a row over her staff - leaving her as an independent."

Labour MP Liz McInnes sent her best wishes to Dimbleby and spoke of her keenness to see a woman at the helm of the show. Fantastic to see so many women in the frame to succeed David Dimbleby. I hope that whoever takes over brings their own style and remains very much their own woman. Best wishes to DD in his semi-retirement #bbcqt https://t.co/FptsxfzrsaEnd of Twitter post  by @LizMcInnes_MPIt is not known how much Dimbleby is paid for his role because Question Time is made by an independent production company, meaning his salary did not appear in last year's list of top paid BBC stars. Recent reports in the Telegraph speculated that he was paid £450,000 per annum by the corporation.Question Time has been on air for nearly 40 years. It was initially chaired by Robin Day (1979-89) and later by Peter Sissons (1989-93)."

2018-06-19,Government 'could collapse' over Brexit deal,https://web.archive.org//web/20180618203033/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44511969,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowTory rebels ""could collapse the government"" if they vote against a Brexit deal negotiated with the EU, a leading rebel has said.Dominic Grieve said he wakes up ""in a cold sweat"" thinking about what could happen if a final deal is rejected. But he suggested rebels would not back down in a current row with ministers about how much of a say MPs should get.The EU Withdrawal Bill returns to the Lords and Commons this week, with further rebellions expected.Last week the government avoided a defeat on the bill after agreeing to hold further talks with rebels.They want a bigger role for Parliament, should a final Brexit deal be rejected by MPs, or if no deal is reached - the so-called ""meaningful vote"".Former Attorney General Mr Grieve told BBC One's Sunday Politics that he thought they had agreed MPs could have an ""advisory"" vote, that would not order the government to do anything, but would help people to ""keep calm"" during what would be a ""critical situation"". But after two days of talks, Mr Grieve said a government amendment drawn up to avert a rebellion was changed at the last minute and was now ""valueless"".  He implied rebels would vote against it this week: ""I'm absolutely sure that the group is quite determined that the meaningful vote pledge, which was given to us, has got to be fulfilled.""He added: ""The alternative is that we've all got to sign up to a slavery clause now, saying whatever the government does, when it comes to January, however potentially catastrophic it might be for my constituents and my country, I'm signing in blood now that I will follow over the edge of a cliff, and that I can tell you, I am not prepared to do.""   The government's amendment to the EU (Withdrawal) Bill sets out what must happen in the event of three scenarios: If MPs vote down the UK-EU Brexit deal, if Theresa May announces before 21 January 2019 that no deal has been reached, or if 21st January passes with no deal being struck.Under these circumstances, a minister must make a statement in Parliament setting out their next steps and give MPs an opportunity to vote.However, the vote would be on ""a motion in neutral terms"", merely stating that the House has considered the statement.Rebels had originally wanted the amendment to say that the government must seek the approval of Parliament for its course of action - and that ministers must be directed by MPs and peers.When it was put to him that voting against any Brexit deal at ""the 11th hour"" of negotiations could cause the government to collapse, he replied:  ""We could collapse the government and I can assure you, I wake up at 2am in a cold sweat thinking about the problems that we have put on our shoulders."" Last week another Conservative MP, Tom Tugendhat, told Sky News there was ""going to be a new government"" if MPs rejected the government's Brexit deal.Solicitor General Robert Buckland said that ""however well intentioned"" Mr Grieve's plan had been, his worry was that ""it actually plays badly in the most important negotiation, which is over in Brussels"".It would imply to the EU, he said, that ""there's a third party in this relationship"" - Parliament - which could ""trump whatever the UK government say"". He said ministers would stick with the new amendment for Monday, adding: ""Let's see what the Lords make of it. Of course we have Tuesday to consider matters ahead of the Wednesday vote.""Earlier the prime minister defended her handling of the row.She told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show she had met Tory rebels and ""undertook to consider their concerns"".She admitted there had been ""a debate"" about what a ""meaningful"" vote for Parliament meant: ""I've listened carefully to the concerns, I've put an amendment down which I think balances this issue of the role of Parliament together with the need for us to ensure we don't overturn the decision of the British people.""But she said Parliament ""cannot tie the hands of government in negotiations"".The main purposes of the EU Withdrawal Bill are to end the supremacy of EU law in the UK, and transfer existing EU law into UK law so the same rules and regulations apply on the day after Brexit.But as it passes through Parliament, MPs and peers have been trying to change it, in some cases adding bits on that would change the government's Brexit strategy.The government says the whole row is about a ""hypothetical"" scenario and they are ""confident we will agree a good deal with the EU which Parliament will support""."

That's what the prime minister used to say.She hasn't suddenly started believing that it exists in the depths of some forest somewhere, let alone in the well-manicured back garden of Number 10.But when she used to say that, what Theresa May meant was that the Tories did not want to raise taxes or borrow more to pay for the NHS.She would always remind you that the overall amount of money going in was increasing - but as is well-documented, the demands on the health service have been outpacing the resources available.What's happened is that after many months of argument - remember the cabinet discussing tax rises for health much earlier this year and the ongoing desire of Brexiteers in government to find more cash for the NHS (more of that in a minute) - the prime minister has been convinced by the health secretary and others that the strain on the health service is so acute that there simply is no choice.Jeremy Hunt has been remarkably open about this in recent weeks, and explicitly so today. Theresa May has also made it plain that tax rises are on the table.But what she won't do yet is tell us who will pay, or even rule out any particular taxes going up, down or being frozen to find the money.Be clear, the political decision to find the money has been made. It is even more political to decide from where. And this moment is not just about the NHS, it's about the era when the Tories' priority was paying down the deficit above all else coming to an end.Opposition politicians are rightly pushing for more detail. But this political shift is also awkward for Labour, as the amount promised is more than Labour had proposed during the election - advocating tax rises themselves, it's not clear where else the party can go.It is also the moment when Theresa May seems rather boldly to be willing to try to pull off a rhetorical accounting trick. She repeated her suggestion today that the money for the NHS will come, in part, from the so called ""Brexit dividend"".That is a matter of political presentation, not reality. Yes, after we leave the European Union and complete the transition period (leaving the departure lounge) it is true that we will no longer pay what's basically a membership subscription of £9bn a year.But what Number 10 and especially the Treasury know very well is that as things stand official forecasts suggest that the economy, the overall amount of cash available for the government to spend, will be smaller than if we had stayed in.In the most simple terms, Whitehall number-crunchers predict we will lose more cash wise than we will gain. Now, economic forecasts are often and thoroughly shown to be wrong. But right now, to suggest somehow that Brexit will partly pay for the NHS is at best extremely uncertain, at worst, downright misleading.Remember this though. The Vote Leave campaign repeatedly used a real figure of £350m that they knew gave only part of the picture about the costs of leaving the EU.That drove the Remain side, and plenty of voters, crazy - and there is still anger about it now. But they knew also that every time the other side complained about it, their claims about the NHS were heard by more people.Is Theresa May doing the same? Whether it is designed to cause controversy, or just give her Brexiteer ministers something rhetorical to applaud, she is certainly taking flak. It is one thing for a campaign group to put a pretty slippery gloss on statistics, and that caused enough outrage.It's quite another for the whole machinery of government to do the same."
2018-06-19,Week ahead,https://web.archive.org//web/20180618203033/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-parliaments-44495167,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowIt's back to Brexit again in both Houses of Parliament, after the issue of a ""meaningful vote"" unexpectedly detonated. Soft Brexit/Remainer Tory MPs, led by the former attorney general Dominic Grieve, thought they had a deal with the prime minister on the issue. They had drawn back from rebelling on Tuesday on the promise of a compromise - but then discovered that the government was not offering them what they thought had been conceded.Essentially the issue is about what happens if the divorce talks with the EU run out of time, or fail to deliver a deal, or if MPs reject the proposed deal. Here comes the science bit - concentrate!On Tuesday, MPs were presented with a Lords amendment that would have given the power to MPs to direct the government's next steps in those contingencies. The government offered a replacement amendment in the Commons (an ""amendment in lieu"" in parliamentary jargon) which gave MPs a vote on the final deal, but, crucially, did not give them the opportunity to direct the government's future strategy - what they would get instead would be a statement within 28 days, setting out how the government ""proposes to proceed in relation to negotiations for the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the EU"".Dominic Grieve responded with his own amendment, which was similar to the Lords proposal, but put stronger conditions on MPs being given the power to direct the government. He set out three options which would only kick in three particular scenarios: Having pulled back from rebellion he was expecting the government to concede most of these powers, but it was not to be - and now his Lords ally Lord Hailsham (the former cabinet minister Douglass Hogg) is to put forward his proposals in the Lords, with the aim of replacing the amendment the government won in the Commons, and kicking it back to MPs. The point is that Mr Grieve and his allies would then have a chance to press it to a vote - and quite possibly win.  Both Houses have to agree on the final form of legislation before it can become law, and this intricate process - ""ping pong"" in Westminster-speak - is how MPs and peers reach an agreed wording. So on Monday we will have the Lords votes on the changes made by the Commons. Peers will probably accept most of them, but the Hailsham amendment looks set fair to be accepted (the previous version was passed by a majority of 91 votes) and it will then be kicked back to the Commons, for consideration on Wednesday.Will it win there? The government has a narrow majority with its DUP allies, but if the group around Mr Grieve vote with Labour and the other opposition parties, they would have a majority. Unless some Labour MPs broke ranks and voted with the government, or abstained. And there is a contingent of pro Brexit MPs and MPs from strongly Leave constituencies who may well do so. The arithmetic looks very tight, and the rival sets of party whips will doubtless be working very hard to minimise the number of rebels on their side. It's worth remembering that the Grieve group, unlike the Brexiteers, are not bloodied in rebellion from years of backbench insurgency - so it will be interesting to see if the iron has entered their souls, or whether they can be persuaded to relent. In the end it might even come down to MPs being taken ill or stuck on a train - but unless a new compromise is struck over the weekend, and the implication of bad faith around the previous deal may make that hard to do - we could be in for a week of drama which could prove highly destabilising to the government.Something else to watch out for is an effort to secure an Estimates Day debate on the Defence Budget; debates on these days are under a procedure which allows detailed discussion of money issues, and both the Defence Select Committee and the Public Accounts Committee are extremely concerned about the state of the Ministry of Defence finances. As luck would have it, members of both were recently together at Rossyth, for a visit to the new aircraft carrier, HMS Queen Elizabeth II, and the rumour is that a coordinated move to get the issue onto the floor of the Commons has been cooked up. Here's my rundown of the week ahead:The Commons opens (2.30 pm) with Housing, Communities and Local Government questions - and any statements or urgent questions will follow at 3.30 pm. Then comes the Emergency Debate secured by the SNP leader, Ian Blackford, on the Sewel Convention - the convention that Westminster seeks ""legislative consent"" for new laws touching on the devolved governments of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.  This follows the passage of amendments to the EU (Withdrawal) Bill on which EU powers will and will not be passed to the devolved parliaments, which were opposed by the Scottish Parliament. After  last week's furious scenes, this could provide another flashpoint between the SNP and, in particular, the Scottish Tory MPs and the government whips - the whips have developed a habit of standing close to the SNP benches and heckling their MPs, which is much resented. MPs then deal with Lords amendments to the Automated and Electric Vehicles Bill - in what should be a pretty brief encounter, before moving on to votes on a statutory instrument on the Draft European Union (Definition of Treaties) (Canada Trade Agreement) Order and European Documents relating to EU Trade Agreements: EU-Japan Economic Partnership Agreement. And after that there is a general debate on how the NHS and other public services deal with acquired brain injuries.In Westminster Hall (4.30 pm) MPs debate e-petition 209433: ""Give the electorate a referendum on the abolition of the House of Lords - the House of Lords is a place of patronage where unelected and unaccountable individuals hold a disproportionate amount of influence and power which can be used to frustrate the elected representatives of the people."" The petition attracted 168,755 signatures.My committee pick is the Transport Committee hearing (4.45pm) on Rail timetable changes - when MPs will question top executives from GTR, Arriva Rail North, London North Western and Network Rail. It was announced on Friday that Charles Horton is to resign as chief executive of Govia Thameslink Railway, following months of controversy over delays and cancellations to services. Bring popcorn. In the Lords, after a half hour question time at 2.30pm, peers embark on their consideration of Commons amendments to the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill  (see above).MPs kick off (at 11.30 am) with Health and Social Care questions, after which the Conservative Craig Mackinlay presents a Ten Minute Rule Bill to give Gibraltar an MP (this had been due to be debated some months ago, and was rescheduled). Then comes a Labour Opposition Day Debate on a motion (or motions) to be announced.In Westminster Hall, the opening debate (9.30am) is on Romania: the member state which will hold the EU Presidency next year, and therefore has a crucial brokering role in the final Brexit negotiations. The debate will be opened by the Conservative, Bob Blackman, who believes Romania is very keen to help, and will want to extend bilateral arrangements with the UK, post Brexit. He also wants to discuss Romanian concerns about Russian activity in the Black Sea.Labour's Helen Goodman (2.30pm) leads a debate on geothermal energy, which she says has a huge potential to provide a carbon free energy source - including in former coal communities, where decommissioned mine shafts can be used. But, she says, it does not feature in the government's energy strategy. Her aim in this debate is to raise the profile and press ministers to take the opportunities seriously.My committee corridor pick is the International Development hearing (10am) on the humanitarian situation in Gaza, with witnesses from the UN, followed by the Foreign Office and International Development and minister, Alistair Burt.In the Lords (2.30pm) peers debate the detail of the Rating (Property in Common Occupation) and Council Tax (Empty Dwellings) Bill - the measure that will allow local councils to increase the tax on empty homes. Then there is a short debate on encouraging a recovery in the population of bees and other pollinators.The Commons begins (11.30am) with half an hour of Northern Ireland questions, before moving on to the high noon of Prime Minister's Question time.The day's Ten Minute Rule Bill, from the SNP's Martin Docherty-Hughes aims to create an Armed Forces Representative Body. Time has then been set aside to consider Lords amendments to the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill (see above) and there will be a general debate on Nato.One thing to keep an eye on is a possible statement from a health minister on the findings of Bishop James Jones' independent inquiry into deaths at the Gosport Memorial Hospital. The inquiry was commissioned during the coalition years, following concerns about the over-use of morphine on patients. Look out for Lib Dem former health minister Norman Lamb...In Westminster Hall, there are debates on the UN report on the convention on the rights of persons with disabilities (9.30am-11am);  the UK constitutional machinery and the frameworks for intergovernmental cooperation (2.30pm-4pm); UK and Polish war reparations against Germany (4pm-4.30pm) and insecure work and the gig economy (4.30pm-5.30pm). On the committee corridor, the Housing, Communities and Local Government Committee (9.30am) takes evidence one year on, on local authority support for Grenfell Tower survivors - there are witnesses from Grenfell United, the North Kensington Law Centre, Councillor Elizabeth Campbell, the Leader of Kensington and Chelsea Council, and Nick Hurd, the minister of state for Policing and Fire Service, with responsibility for Grenfell Tower victims work, at the Home Office. And meanwhile, there's a lively session in prospect, when arch europhile MEP Guy ""the Hoff"" Verhofstadt, the coordinator and chair of the European Parliament Brexit Steering Group, gives evidence to the Brexit Committee on the progress of the UK's negotiations on EU withdrawal (9.15 am) - and he turns up again in the afternoon, before the Home Affairs Committee (2.30pm) to talk about Post-Brexit migration policy. The European Parliament has to sign off on the EU side of Britain's divorce deal, so his views will matter.In the Lords (3pm), the main event is the second reading of the Courts and Tribunals (Judiciary and Functions of Staff) Bill, which seeks to remove restrictions on how judges can be deployed, so they can hear a wider range of cases. The Commons opens (9.30am) with Digital, Culture, Media and Sport questions, followed by questions to the Attorney General (10.10am) and the weekly Business Questions to the Leader of the House. The main debates are on backbench motions on the importance of refugee family reunion - the SNP's Angus Brendan MacNeil proposes a motion welcoming the fact that the Refugees (Family Reunion) (No.2) Bill was given its second reading without opposition on 16 March 2018, and calling on the government to support the bill.Then Labour MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle has a motion on the future of the Erasmus+ student exchange scheme, after 2020, calling on the government to ensure continued UK access, after Brexit.In the Lords (11am) question time marks national Yoga Day with a query on the benefits of yoga for obese school children. Peers then debate the support available to carers and the Carers Action Plan 2018 - 2020; and the implications for the UKs future trade relations following the failure to reach agreement at the G7 Summit in Canada. And then they discuss the contribution of the armed forces reserves to national security. Neither House sits on Friday 22 June."

But in the process he's angered anti-war activists and critics of British and Western foreign policy, who claim he's been biased against them. ""Christmas Day, Eid day, Easter Day, Cup final day, early hours of the morning, in the middle of the night - this man is on my case,"" says George Galloway, the former Labour and Respect Party MP. ""And it doesn't take an Einstein to work out he's not tending this garden with loving care or to make it look as nice as it can look. It's the opposite."" The subject of Galloway's ire is a prolific Wikipedia editor who goes by the name ""Philip Cross"". He's been the subject of a huge debate on the internet encyclopaedia - one of the world's most popular websites - and also on Twitter. And he's been accused of bias for interacting, sometimes negatively, with some of the people whose Wikipedia pages he's edited. The Philip Cross account was created at precisely 18:48 GMT on 26 October 2004. Since then, he's made more than 130,000 edits to more 30,000 pages. That's a substantial amount, but not hugely unusual - it's not enough edits, for example, to put him in the top 300 editors on Wikipedia. But it's what he edits which has preoccupied anti-war politicians and journalists. In his top 10 most-edited pages are the jazz musician Duke Ellington, The Sun newspaper, and Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre. But also in that top 10 are a number of vocal critics of American and British foreign policy: the journalist John Pilger, Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn and Corbyn's director of strategy, Seamus Milne.His critics also say that Philip Cross has made favourable edits to pages about public figures who are supportive of Western military intervention in the Middle East. He's recently caught the attention of bloggers and has been the subject of stories in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz and Russian state-owned outlets Sputnik and RT. There have been allegations on social media - all unproven - that he's a government agent, employed by rich and powerful media interests, or is a mainstream journalist with an obsessive hobby.You may also be interested in:""His edits are remorselessly targeted at people who oppose the Iraq war, who've opposed the subsequent intervention wars … in Libya and Syria, and people who criticise Israel,"" Galloway says.

More on this storyFor example, a sentence where Galloway criticised the Labour Party as ""Tony Blair's lie machine"" was removed, with Cross citing ""partial repetition, poor source"". In another case, Cross removed links to lurid tabloid headlines about Galloway's private life. In addition, many of the edits were simply grammatically or stylistic.  At one point Cross noted: ""It helps the article if each sentence or paragraph does not begin with 'Galloway' or 'He'.""Wikipedia, which was launched in 2001, relies on volunteers to write and edit entries. Wikipedians have developed an enormous set of rules and procedures guiding the development of a site which now has more than 5.5m articles in English.In addition to his Wikipedia edits, Philip Cross has a Twitter account which he has used to interact with Galloway and other politicians and journalists. In one tweet, for instance, he called a group of anti-war activists ""goons"". That raised claims of a conflict of interest, which is potentially against Wikipedia guidelines. The account is currently subject to a review process run by Wikipedia volunteers, although Philip Cross has promised to stop editing Galloway's entry for an ""indeterminate length of time regardless of any decision"".The Wikimedia Foundation - which established and funds Wikipedia - declined an interview request, but said in a statement:""Independent volunteer editors consistently monitor Wikipedia, often aided by technology, to ensure its articles remain neutral and well-sourced for the hundreds of millions of people who rely on it every month. ""If repeat violations to Wikipedia policies do occur, volunteers have a variety of mechanisms to draw from, including issuing warnings and blockings, to address content and behaviour that does not meet Wikipedia standards."" On Twitter, Wikipedia's co-founder, Jimmy Wales, rejected claims that Philip Cross is making entries biased.Because as far as I can tell so far, those complaints are so wrong as to be risible.

2018-06-19,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20180618203033/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-44470777,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe claim: The UK's 20-year devolution convention has been ""ripped up"".Reality Check verdict: The convention has been undermined but there is no legal reason why the UK government cannot ignore the Scottish Parliament over Brexit. Scotland's first minister says the passage of the UK's key Brexit legislation without the consent of the Scottish Parliament has ""ripped up the 20-year-old devolution convention"" in the UK. Is she right?Ms Sturgeon's tweet came after the House of Commons spent less than 20 minutes debating the EU Withdrawal Bill's impact on devolution. The SNP said that showed ""contempt for Scottish democracy"", with the party's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, leading a walk-out of his MPs during Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday.The row centres on a so-called ""power grab"", with the Scottish government accusing Westminster of keeping some powers for itself that should go to the Scottish Parliament at Holyrood, after Brexit.  The UK government says the ""temporary"" move will allow the same rules and regulations to remain in place across the whole of the UK in 24 key areas, such as agriculture, fisheries and food labelling.And it points out that the vast majority of the 153 areas where policy in devolved areas is currently decided in Brussels will go directly to the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly, meaning both will have considerably more powers after Brexit than they do now. Months of talks have failed to reach a deal - although the Welsh government dropped its opposition after changes were made that would put a limit on how long the UK government would keep the powers.Last month, the Scottish Parliament voted overwhelmingly to refuse consent for the Brexit bill, with the SNP being joined by Labour, the Greens and Liberal Democrat MSPs and only the Conservatives voting against. The UK government pressed on regardless - so how was it able to do so? When the devolved Scottish Parliament was set up in 1999, it was handed control over many policy areas such as health and education that had previously been decided at Westminster.However, an agreement signed by the two governments in 2001 stated that ""the United Kingdom Parliament retains authority to legislate on any issue, whether devolved or not"" and that it was ""ultimately for parliament to decide what use to make of that power"". It also stated that the UK government ""will proceed in accordance with the convention that the UK Parliament would not normally legislate with regard to devolved matters except with the agreement of the devolved legislature"". This agreement was inserted into the Scotland Act in 2016, which was drawn up after the independence referendum two years earlier.The word ""normally"" is, of course, an important caveat that is open to different interpretations - is Brexit ""normal"", for example?Scottish Secretary David Mundell said these were not normal times and a failure to proceed with the bill would jeopardise businesses across the UK.He accused the Scottish government of wanting a veto over arrangements that would apply to the whole of the UK and insisted the UK government ""followed the spirit and letter of the devolution settlement at every stage"" despite the failure to secure consent.  Consent is sought through something known as the Sewel Convention, named after former Labour government minister Lord Sewel, which, in effect, allowed the UK government to ask MSPs for permission to change the law in an area that is devolved to Holyrood. Similar conventions apply in both Wales and Northern Ireland. Until Brexit came along, the Scottish Parliament had only once before refused to give its consent - over some aspects of the Welfare Reform Bill in 2011, which resulted in the Scottish government introducing its own legislation to resolve the row. So Ms Sturgeon is correct to say that pushing through the EU Withdrawal Bill without the consent of the Scottish Parliament means that the long-standing convention has, in effect, been ""ripped up"".However, as its name suggests, it is merely a convention and there is no legal requirement for the UK government to seek Holyrood's permission - or to respect its decision if it says ""no"". This was confirmed by the Supreme Court last year, when it ruled on the case brought by Gina Miller about the triggering of Article 50, which started the Brexit process. Judges ruled that the Sewel Convention was not a legally enforceable rule despite being inserted into the Scotland Act.This meant that the Scottish Parliament did not have a veto over Article 50 or, by extension, the EU Withdrawal Bill. Regardless, ignoring the result of the Scottish Parliament vote was sure to provoke fury from the SNP, with Ms Sturgeon warning that ""the decision to act without our consent, and the manner of doing it, will not be forgotten"".Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questionsFollow us on Twitter"
2018-06-19,Game on?,https://web.archive.org//web/20180618203033/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-44497225,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe world of political predictions is a mug's game but I'm going to call this one and I'm prepared to eat humble pie on 4 July.I was told on Twitter this week that stories about the leadership of Plaid Cymru were as a result of ""media stirring"".Here is my case for the defence and why I think there will be a three-way battle for the top job. Much was made on Tuesday of Rhun ap Iorwerth's remarks denying any plan to challenge Leanne Wood, but here's some context. Plaid have an official window whereby any member of the assembly group can put their names forward for the leadership. It comes around every two years and it's open for another three weeks.The party also have a weekly news briefing with journalists, each member of the group taking it in turn to appear. What an opportune time it was to ask Mr ap Iorwerth about his intentions. ""No plans to challenge"" he said, as question after question honed in on the same subject. What else could he say? Some took it to be a categorical assurance that he wouldn't challenge Leanne Wood. ""Plans"" change, of course, and I suspect they changed 24 hours later.That's when an emboldened Leanne Wood said she would ""welcome"" a challenge.  In a BBC interview she mentioned Rhun ap Iorwerth by name and her opposition to the Wylfa Newydd nuclear power station became evident.  It's a project he's supporting. It all amounted to what looks like a ""put up or shut up"" strategy and opened the door for ""plans"" to change.Those close to Rhun ap Iorwerth say he's coming under increasing pressure to stand; that was Wednesday night, by the way.On Thursday morning sources close to Adam Price were saying the same thing. He's got the backing of councillors and constituency parties in Carmarthenshire already. But does he want it? Mr Price, currently on paternity leave, hasn't come under the same amount of scrutiny as his potential rivals this week. In 2016 he was described by MP Jonathan Edwards as a ""once in a generation politician … an X factor politician"", labelled by some the ""Mab Darogan"" - prophetic son - of Welsh folklore. Mr Edwards, as it happened, led Ms Wood's leadership campaign in 2012. It could be awkward.So here's what will happen next - a drip, drip of stories about calls for both Rhun ap Iorwerth and Adam Price to stand.  Watch out for something along the lines of ""it's impossible to ignore what the members want"" or ""because Leanne has welcomed a challenge"".  Three AMs have already signed a letter urging colleagues to stand.It gives the challengers a way in to the contest, and the incumbent will at least have clarity about her position at the end of the process.Behind the scenes I suspect it's game on already."
2018-06-19,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20180618203033/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks have now moved on to future relations - after agreement was reached on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree within six months on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide, but first let's go back to the basics...It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.1% in the first three months of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.4%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand near a 40-year year low of 4.2%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 4.2% in the year to March 2018, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May is seeking to put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. If passed, it will end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, is supposed to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each playing roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanAn agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement wopuld only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.The full details are not yet known but UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72.We don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pounds buy fewer euros. A slump in the value of the dollar means the exchange rate with the pound is pretty close to where it was before the referendum.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.The UK has proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.A method for calculating the bill has been agreed, but the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more.The question of how and when payments will be made still needs to resolved, but it will be a schedule lasting for many years to come, and it is highly unlikely that anyone will ever be able to give an exact figure for the size of the divorce bill.UK sources say it will be up to £40bn, but some EU sources expect it to be higher than that. No-one can say for sure, and both sides want to keep it that way.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 6.5% in 2016 to 2.7% in 2017, according to the Halifax. It said the slowdown was driven by a squeeze on real wage growth.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-06-19,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180618203033/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to £840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"".

As I write, Mrs May is holed up with her advisers inside Tory HQ. But a former minister Anna Soubry has called for her to ""consider her position"" - political code for calling for her to resign. Read more from LauraJohn Curtice, Professor of Politics at the University of StrathclydeThis is the third post-war snap election called unexpectedly before a party's term of office had come to an end.  On the two previous occasions in 1970 and February 1974 the PM and the party lost office. While there is no other conceivable administration in the new parliament other than a Conservative-led one, it remains to be seen whether the PM will retain her position. However, so long as the Conservatives can reach an accommodation with the DUP they will have a working majority in the House of Commons.  BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed:When the general election exit poll was revealed at 10pm, the pound immediately dropped by 2% as investors took a position that a hung parliament was a possible outcome of the general election.Why would that cause the currency to decline? Because a hung parliament means that the government's direction of travel would be less certain.

Michael Russell said the Scottish government no longer trusted UK ministers after they pushed through the Brexit bill last week.He was speaking as Nicola Sturgeon arrived in Guernsey for talks with UK Cabinet Minister David Lidington.Mr Lidington said governments should ""co-operate on the big issues"".He insisted the UK government was committed to maintaining a good working relationship with the devolved administrations despite the ""inevitable political noise"" over Brexit.And he urged the Scottish government ""to maintain their own side of that relationship"".Relations between the two governments are said to be at their lowest ever level after the Commons last week spent less than 20 minutes debating the EU Withdrawal Bill's impact on devolution, despite the Scottish Parliament voting to withhold consent. Ms Sturgeon has accused the UK government of ""ripping up"" the devolution settlement.The first minister also said she was ""proud"" of SNP MPs who walked out of Prime Minister's Questions in protest over the UK government's handling of the bill - a move that was derided as a ""pre-arranged stunt"" by opponents. Senior SNP and Scottish government figures have said the protest was not a one-off, and it would not be ""business as usual"" for devolution.Speaking to the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme, Mr Russell said he ""couldn't conceive of circumstances"" where MSPs would vote to give approval for further UK legislation related to leaving the EU, such as trade, agriculture and fisheries.He added: ""We are absolutely clear that the way that devolution operates and the structures of devolution have failed, and they failed because the UK government is refusing to operate them.""For example, on the Sewel Convention, we need to have the interpretation of that written down in statute and made legally binding, because what we've presently got is a situation where the UK government makes the rules and then breaks them themselves, and there are no sanctions.""He said that, while there was ""practical work"" to do to prepare for Brexit, ""it is very difficult to do that work because, frankly, we don't trust the UK government with it"".Ms Sturgeon and Mr Lidington are at a meeting of the British-Irish Council in Guernsey, which is also being attended by Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones and representatives from Guernsey, Jersey and the Isle of Man.Ahead of the meeting, Ms Sturgeon and Mr Jones issued a joint statement in which they repeated their call for the UK to remain in the single market and customs union after Brexit - which has already been ruled out by Prime Minister Theresa May. Airbus announced on Friday morning that it could leave the UK if the country exits the European Union single market and customs union without a transition deal.Mr Russell said the announcement was further evidence of the ""carnage"" in terms of jobs and the economy that Brexit could bring. The EU Withdrawal has been at the centre of a long-running row between Edinburgh and London, and has been pushed through by the UK government despite MSPs at Holyrood refusing to grant consent.It is the first time this has happened since the Scottish Parliament was created in 1999.Please upgrade your browserMr Lidington said voters expected the governments across the UK to work together and highlighted how Scotland had voted to remain part of the UK.He said: ""Working together is exactly what people all across the UK want to see their respective governments doing.""They want to see their lives being improved through joint endeavour. They don't expect different governments - with politicians from different parties - to agree on everything.""But they do expect us to keep talking - and listening - to each other, and to co-operate on the big issues that affect us all.""The UK government is committed to ""not normally"" passing laws that impact on devolved powers under something known as the Sewel Convention.But it argues that Brexit means these are not ""normal"" times, and that it needed to act despite not having Holyrood consent in order to allow a smooth transition after the UK leaves the EU.The row over the Brexit bill centres on 153 powers in what are now devolved areas, but which were sent to Brussels when the UK joined the EU in 1973. Westminster effectively wants to keep ""temporary"" control of 24 of these powers when they return to the UK after Brexit, with the remainder of the 153 going directly to the Scottish Parliament.It says having control in key areas such as farming and food labelling for the first few years after Brexit will ensure the same rules continue to be followed across the UK.The Scottish government wants all of the powers straight away - although it agrees that UK-wide rules and regulations are needed - and has repeatedly accused the UK government of a ""power grab""."

The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019.The UK government is considering two other options: a customs partnership that would remove the need for new customs checks at the border; and a ""highly streamlined"" customs arrangement that would minimise customs checks rather than getting rid of them altogether.Michel Barnier, the EU's Brexit negotiator, has said that both options are unrealistic.A spokesperson for Prime Minister Theresa May said: ""We are confident that we are going to get a good deal, one that ensures that trade is as free and frictionless as possible, including for the aerospace sector,"" A Welsh government spokesperson said the Airbus announcement was ""extremely worrying"".""We have repeatedly warned that the UK cannot take the huge economic risk of cutting ourselves adrift from the single market and customs union. Particularly in the case of manufacturing sectors, which in Wales are so important in providing high-paid, high-skilled jobs.""The BBC's business editor, Simon Jack, says the Airbus announcement reflects ""growing exasperation"" over Brexit in the UK's boardrooms.He adds that Business Secretary Greg Clark has been similarly exasperated by companies' tendency to complain to him about the issue, only to soften their tone when faced with the prime minister.""He, I think, will be delighted that a company with Airbus's footprint has gone as public as this,"" our business editor said.In its Brexit ""risk assessment"" published on Thursday, Airbus said if the UK left the EU next year without a deal - meaning it left both the single market and customs union immediately and without any agreed transition - it would ""lead to severe disruption and interruption of UK production"". ""This scenario would force Airbus to reconsider its investments in the UK, and its long-term footprint in the country,"" it added.The company, which makes wings for the A320, A330/A340, A350 and A380 passenger planes in the UK, also said the current planned transition period, due to end in December 2020, was too short for it to make changes to its supply chain. As a result, it would ""refrain from extending"" its UK supplier base. It said it currently had more than 4,000 suppliers in the UK.Tom Williams, chief operating officer of Airbus Commercial Aircraft, said in ""any scenario"", Brexit had ""severe negative consequences"" for the UK aerospace industry and Airbus in particular.Without a deal, he said Airbus believed the impact on its UK operations could be ""significant"". ""Put simply, a no-deal scenario directly threatens Airbus' future in the UK.""Mr Williams told the BBC's Today programme that Airbus was currently working on developing the ""next generation"" of aircraft wings in the UK.""We are seriously considering whether we should continue that development or whether we should find alternative solutions,"" he added.Airbus UK's senior vice-president, Katherine Bennett, said the company had ""huge concerns"" about a possible no-deal Brexit: ""We're very fearful there will be chaos at the borders and we want our factories to be able to operate as smoothly as possible.""Conservative MP Stephen Crabb said the warning from Airbus should be a ""wake-up call"".Mr Crabb tweeted: ""The enormous Airbus factory in North Wales is one of the jewels in the crown of UK manufacturing. This is a wake-up call. A pragmatic, sensible Brexit that protects trade & jobs is vital.""And shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer tweeted: ""If proof was needed that the PM's Brexit red lines need to be abandoned (and fast), this is it.""The warnings from Airbus echo comments made on Wednesday by the boss of Siemens in the UK.  Jürgen Maier said the UK should remain in the customs union after Brexit unless there was a ""proper alternative"".Last week, Paul Drechsler, the outgoing president of the CBI, said some parts of industry in the UK faced extinction if the country left the EU customs union.Paul Drechsler said car firm bosses had come to him saying the industry would suffer unless there was ""real frictionless trade"".Mr Drechsler also said there was ""zero evidence"" that trade deals outside the EU would provide any economic benefit to Britain."
2018-06-20,£2.4m spent on Commons gagging clauses,https://web.archive.org//web/20180622101246/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44571120,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe House of Commons spent £2.4m on ""gagging clauses"" for former staff since 2013, BBC Newsnight has learned.Fifty-three departing members of the House of Commons Service signed contracts compelling them not to reveal information about the Commons.So-called ""non-disclosure agreements"" (NDAs) can be used to silence victims of bullying or harassment.A House spokesman said the clauses were used ""to resolve employment disputes under certain circumstances"".Newsnight uncovered the information via a Freedom of Information Act request, which was made as part of its investigation into bullying and harassment by MPs of members of the House of Commons Service - the apolitical employees who run the Commons and its committees. These people are usually referred to in Westminster as ""clerks"".Newsnight has previously reported that Angus Sinclair, formerly the Speaker's secretary, was paid £86,000 - more than a year of pay - as part of a settlement that entailed him signing a non-disclosure agreement. He felt he was being paid off to stay quiet about being bullied by the Speaker of the House of Commons (an allegation that the Speaker denies). The answer to the request reveals that £2.4m was spent on 53 settlements including gagging clauses with departing staff members since 2013. (The Press Association has, by the same means, got the same information which they are publishing independently.) The average settlement cost £45,418.Jill Rutter of the Institute for Government, said: ""The public sector should not be allowed to waste taxpayers' money on NDAs"". She said it was ""impossible to justify as [value for money]"".These figures are a slight underestimate. There may also be some other cases in 2012 and 2018, but the numbers involved are small enough that they fear publishing them would allow people to figure out information about identifiable individuals. The House of Commons reply to Newsnight clarifies that the NDAs were ""settlement agreements (formerly known as compromise agreements) which include a confidentiality clause"". It is unclear how many of these contracts were signed, as Mr Sinclair believes was the case for him, in order to prevent information about bullying or harassment leaking out.Newsnight has established, however, that confidentiality clauses were not standard in House of Commons exit deals: the annual report for the financial year 2016-17 shows 43 people left the House on ""exit packages"", but only 23 were given NDAs in all of 2016 and 2017.  We also know that people, known to Newsnight, who had made complaints about sexual harassment or bullying at the House were asked to sign NDAs when they left with an exit deal. Some other NDAs, however, were really a means of getting rid of a staff member more easily. Getting them to sign a non-disclosure agreement could be used as a justification for a bigger pay-off. Gagging clauses are sometimes suggested by unions to get more money out of employers for a departing member of staff. So while some of these NDAs may have been intended to keep the culture under wraps, it is not clear how many that applies to. The House of Commons, however, is now likely to face questions about its use of NDAs. The House of Commons does not have trade secrets, for example, that might justify the use of gagging clauses. Maria Miller, chair of the women and equalities committee, which is researching the use of NDAs, said: ""There needs to be more transparency on why payments such as this are being made in the first place.""

2018-06-20,Watchdog expected to find Vote Leave broke rules,https://web.archive.org//web/20180622101246/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44567588,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAn investigation into whether the official Leave campaign in the EU Referendum broke electoral rules is scheduled to be published within weeks. The draft Electoral Commission's report concludes that Vote Leave and another smaller campaign group did break the rules, the BBC understands, and is expected to recommend at least one fine.  The latest investigation comes after allegations were made by the whistleblowers Christopher Wylie and Shahmir Sanni that the official Brexit campaign broke the law by colluding with a smaller group, BeLeave. It is understood that the commission did consider this new evidence, but it is not thought that the new information was decisive in proving a breach of the law. This is the first full formal investigation into Vote Leave, although the Electoral Commission had twice examined the campaign's behaviour. One source said that the draft report was ""bizarre"" and had ""gone way off track"" by focusing on the original information that has already been pored over, rather than additional evidence. It's suggested that the commission did not interview, nor request interviews, with the senior members of the Vote Leave Campaign team. Lawyers for those criticised in the report are understood to be challenging the draft findings, and publication could therefore be subject to delay. It is not clear if the commission plans only to recommend civil sanctions like fines, or also suggest referring the matter to the police or Crown Prosecution Service. Suggestions that the official Leave campaign, which featured senior Cabinet ministers, broke the law, would be highly controversial. Vote Leave and BeLeave have both always denied the allegations. An Electoral Commission spokesperson said: ""In accordance with its Enforcement Policy, the Electoral Commission has written to Vote Leave, Mr Darren Grimes and Veterans for Britain to advise each campaigner of the outcome of the investigation announced on 20 November 2017. ""The campaigners have 28 days to make representations before final decisions are taken. ""The commission will announce the outcome of the investigation and publish an investigation report once this final decision has been taken.""  Lawyer Tamsin Allen, who acts for Mr Sanni, Mr Wylie and a third whistleblower, said ""The legal opinion and evidence submitted to the EC demonstrated the grounds for suspecting that Vote Leave and BeLeave conducted an unlawful spending scheme.  ""If the Electoral Commission has indeed found those in the scheme guilty of  electoral offences, this is vindication for the whistleblowers, but a serious blow for the public and for the integrity of the referendum vote."""
2018-06-20,UK's plan for EU citizens who want to stay,https://web.archive.org//web/20180622101246/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44553225,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowEU citizens will have to answer three ""simple"" questions online if they want to continue living in the UK after Brexit, the home secretary has said.Sajid Javid said the government's ""default"" position would be to grant, not refuse, settled status.People will be asked to prove their ID, whether they have criminal convictions and whether they live in the UK.Their answers will be checked against government databases and a decision given ""very quickly"", said Mr Javid.The scheme will operate online and via a smartphone app, Mr Javid said, and would be ""as simple as people can reasonably expect"", with most decisions turned around within two weeks or sooner.Speaking to a House of Lords committee, Mr Javid said there would have to be ""a very good reason"" why an application would be refused.The Home Office said the criminal record checks would be about ""serious and persistent criminality, not parking fines"".The £170m scheme will be compulsory for all EU citizens living in the UK - the government expects a total of 3.5 million applications.EU citizens and family members who have been in the UK for five years by the end of 2020 will be able to apply for ""settled status"", meaning they are free to go on living and working in the UK indefinitely.Those who have arrived by December 31, 2020, but do not have five years' residence, can seek to stay until they have, at which point they can seek settled status.The scheme also includes citizens of Switzerland, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.Applications will cost £65 for adults and £32.50 for children and be free for EU nationals who already have residency or indefinite leave to remain.Applicants will be asked to provide their biographical information, declare whether they have any criminal records, and upload a facial photograph.The process requires verification of the applicant's identity and nationality using a passport, ID card or other valid document, which can be done using a smartphone app or through secure post.The government hopes to start trials within a few weeks, with people allowed to start registering in the autumn.Mr Javid told the Lords EU Justice sub-committee he wanted it to be fully operational by the ""start of next year"", adding that he wanted to avoid a ""surge"" of applicants when the UK leaves the EU in March.The scheme would run for at least two years after Brexit day, probably to around June 2021, said the home secretary.The hope is that most applicants will not have to provide supporting documents because their answers will be checked against HM Revenue and Customs and other government databases.Applicants with Android phones will be able to download an app which can read the chip in their passport to verify their identity - and they will be able to take a ""selfie"" that can be checked against Home Office records, said Mr Javid.But he said there was an ""an issue at the moment"" with Apple device users, who will not be able to make use of this app, and instead will have to send in their passport to prove their identity.The home secretary said he had raised the issue with Apple on a recent visit to Silicon Valley and the company was ""looking at it actively"".Analysis by BBC Home Affairs correspondent Danny ShawWhat the Home Office is embarking on is a hugely complex project within a tight timescale.  When challenged about the potential for it go wrong, officials point to the Passport Office as an example of a service successfully processing millions of cases every year. But unlike the biometric passport system, the EU registration scheme is being built from scratch. For hundreds of thousands of EU nationals, who have a straightforward and legitimate employment history in Britain and are comfortable using digital technology, their applications may well be resolved ""within days"", the time officials rather ambitiously claim cases will take. But for claimants hoping to bring in relatives, people unfamiliar with computers and those with a more sketchy background in Britain, perhaps involving some cash-in-hand work, the process may be a hurdle they'll struggle with - or avoid altogether.“After two years of being left in limbo, we don’t take things on trust… we want legally binding guarantees” @maikebohn on ‘settled status’ and rights of EU citizens in UK after Brexit #bbcdp pic.twitter.com/iCyREHpf4iEnd of Twitter post  by @daily_politicsLabour MP Yvette Cooper, chair of the Commons home affairs committee, said ""far more"" answers were needed from the government ""about what happens to those who aren't registered by June 2021 through no fault of their own, such as children"". ""At the moment it appears that if children aren't registered within the next three years then they will lose their legal rights even though they may have been here all their lives."" SNP home affairs spokeswoman Jo Cherry, speaking in the Commons, said: ""There are potentially significant numbers of people who could fall through the cracks here. ""If just 5% of the estimated three million EU citizens living in the UK don't register by the deadline there would be a population of nearly 200,000 left without status.""Former Labour minister Hilary Benn, who chairs the Commons Brexit Committee, asked ministers if the scheme would still stand in the event of a no-deal Brexit.Immigration Minister Caroline Nokes said: ""We have confidence that there will be a deal.""Sajid Javid promised there would be no repeat of the Windrush scandal - which saw people who had lived in the UK for decades threatened with deportation because they did not have the right paperwork - for EU migrants, adding ""lessons had been learned"".The new ""settled status"" scheme would establish the right of EU migrants to remain in the UK, unlike in the case of Windrush families where there was only an assumption they had a right to stay, without any documentary proof, he told the committee.The home secretary accused EU nations, such as France and Spain, of failing to match the UK's progress on plans for expats after Brexit.There are about 900,000 UK citizens in the EU, according to ONS figures.Both sides of the Brexit negotiations have resolved to secure the status of expats by the time the UK leaves the EU in March 2019.But any deal they reach will have to be ratified by the European Parliament and agreed to by member states.If the UK leaves the EU without a deal then the status of British citizens living in the EU member states is less certain.The UK would expect member states to allow Britons living in the EU the same rights as it plans to grant EU citizens in the UK but it would be down to individual countries to decide what to do."

Producing clothes requires toxic chemicals and produces climate-changing emissions. ""Every time we put on a wash, thousands of plastic fibres wash down the drain and into the oceans. We don't know where or how to recycle end of life clothing.""Our inquiry will look at how the fashion industry can remodel itself to be both thriving and sustainable.""The committee is inviting people to comment by September on the environmental impact of the fashion industry, waste, unwanted clothing and working conditions in UK garment factories.Among the questions it will ask is whether fast fashion is unsustainable, and what can be done to encourage people to buy fewer clothes and think more about how they are disposed of."

Nearly 500 Caribbean migrants from countries including Jamaica, Bermuda and Trinidad exited the Windrush on the 22 June 1948 when it docked at Tilbury in Essex. They had applied to job adverts after World War Two with the hope of finding long-term employment in the UK, having gained a type of citizenship under the British Nationality Act of 1948.The Westminster Abbey service will commemorate the contribution the migrants and their families have made to the UK. Meanwhile, a celebration of Caribbean culture will be held at Tilbury Docks to mark the anniversary.The government has also announced Baroness Floella Benjamin is to lead a commemoration committee overseeing the creation of a ""fitting legacy"" to the Windrush generation. A statue celebrating their achievements is among the ideas for the permanent tribute.Baroness Benjamin, a former children's television presenter and Lib Dem peer, was born in Trinidad but emigrated to the UK with her family in 1960. She said: ""This a significant step in recognising the contribution made to Britain by Caribbean people and this committee will make sure the work and sacrifices of the Windrush pioneers will live on in the hearts and minds of future generations.""The right to remain in the UK for Commonwealth migrants who arrived before 1973 was supposed to be legally guaranteed. But it emerged this year that some migrants from the Windrush generation - many of them who arrived as children  - had faced deportation. They were being refused healthcare and access to jobs because they did not have the paperwork to prove their status following a tightening of immigration rules in 2014.The government has since apologised for the crisis and says a dedicated taskforce has now provided documentation to over 2,000 people demonstrating their right to live in the UK. Earlier this week, the government announced an annual Windrush Day would take place."

The duties on €2.8bn (£2.4bn) worth of US goods came into force on Friday. Tariffs have been imposed on products such as bourbon whiskey, motorcycles and orange juice.European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker said duties imposed by the US on the EU go against ""all logic and history"".Addressing the Irish parliament in Dublin, he added that ""we will do what we have to do to rebalance and safeguard"" the EU.The Trump administration announced in March that it would introduce tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminium imported into the US.Mr Trump has argued that global oversupply of steel and aluminium, driven by China, threatens American steel and aluminium producers, which are vital to the US.After being deferred, the duties on steel and aluminium went ahead on 1 June and affect the EU, Canada, Mexico and other close US allies, including India.For its part, India has said it will raise taxes on 29 products imported from the US - including some agricultural goods, steel and iron products - in retaliation for the wide-ranging US tariffs.The new duties will come into effect from 4 August and will affect US almonds, walnuts and chick peas, among other products. South Korea, Argentina, Australia and Brazil have agreed to put limits on the volume of metals they can ship to the US in lieu of tariffs.However, Canada has announced it will impose retaliatory tariffs on C$16.6bn (£9.5bn) worth of US exports from 1 July.And Mexico put tariffs on $3bn worth of American products ranging from steel to pork and bourbon two weeks ago.Earlier this week, Mr Trump threatened to impose 10% duties on an additional $200bn (£150bn) worth of Chinese goods which he said would come into force if China ""refuses to change its practices"".However, China accused the US of an act of ""extreme pressure and blackmail"" and said it would respond with ""strong counter-measures"".President Trump believes that if you have a trade deficit - if you import more than you export - you are losing out.He is especially irked by the hefty deficits in US trade with China and Mexico, but has indicated that he will not let any country ""take advantage of us on trade any more"".Sorry, we cannot let our friends, or enemies, take advantage of us on Trade anymore. We must put the American worker first!End of Twitter post  by @realDonaldTrumpThe US trade deficit has increased in recent years, running at around $50bn (£38bn).However, this could be the result of a stronger economy, with US consumers buying more goods from overseas. The new tariffs are meant to correct this imbalance.There were confrontational scenes and words after the recent G7 summit in Quebec, at which the other major world economies challenged Mr Trump's tariffs and trade policies. The majority of US goods targeted by the EU, such as tobacco, Harley Davidson motorcycles, cranberries and peanut butter, will now carry a tariff of 25%. However, the EU has introduced a 50% duty on goods such as footwear, some types of clothing and washing machines.Many of the products the EU has in its sights are specifically chosen to have maximum political effect. Bourbon whiskey is produced in Kentucky, the state of Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell.Orange juice is a key export for Florida, a swing state in the US elections.Meanwhile, economists have warned the US tariffs could lead to higher metal costs, disrupt supply chains and even get passed on to US households. It's difficult to tell.US trade officials have said they deliberately targeted a list of imports that will not raise prices for consumers. But retailers and producers do not agree.Rick Helfenbein, president and chief executive officer of the American Apparel & Footwear Association, says the average family of four in the US will pay at least an extra $500 a year to buy consumer products affected by the tariffs.In some cases, the tariffs may simply compel firms to seek supplies from other countries rather than pay the extra cost. If, for instance, Florida orange juice goes up in price in Europe because of the EU counter-tariffs, then firms can always import Brazilian orange juice instead.For the US, that would be an unintended consequence of the tit-for-tat spat. But it's a good example of how trade wars can take unexpected turns."
2018-06-20,Hammond: Treasury not the 'enemy of Brexit',https://web.archive.org//web/20180622101246/https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44568125,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe Treasury is not ""the enemy of Brexit"", Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond has insisted.In a speech in the City of London, Mr Hammond said the UK needed to protect patterns of trade with the EU that had been ""built over decades"".The chancellor also used his Mansion House speech to confirm taxes will have to go up to boost spending on the NHS.But he said the increase would be partly funded by lower contributions to Brussels post-Brexit. In the past the chancellor has come under fire from supporters of Brexit.Earlier this month Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson called the Treasury ""the heart of Remain"", in comments to a private dinner. However, addressing a City audience on Thursday, Mr Hammond said the ""immediate key"" to the UK and London's economic success was ""ensuring we get a good Brexit deal"".He said the goal was a partnership that ""recognises that our European neighbours are our most important trading partners, and that Dover to Calais is the busiest trading corridor in Europe"".As the UK leaves the EU, he said the new relationship should ""maintain low friction borders and open markets"".He went on: ""That does not make the Treasury, on my watch, 'the enemy of Brexit'; rather, it makes it the champion of prosperity for the British people outside the EU, but working and trading closely with it.""Mr Hammond also said the £20bn five-year NHS funding package announced by the prime minister this week would be partly funded by lower contributions to Brussels.However, he also said the government would stick to its fiscal rules and ""continue to reduce debt"".As a result taxpayers will have to ""contribute a bit more"", he added.Earlier this week, Prime Minister Theresa May announced a boost in NHS spending, which will see NHS England's budget increase by £20bn by 2023.The plan also means more money will be given to the rest of the UK - about £4bn - although it will be up to the Welsh and Scottish governments to decide how that is spent.Mr Hammond said the NHS was the government's ""number one priority for the forthcoming spending review"".""So, as the Prime Minister said, taxpayers will have to contribute a bit more, in a fair and balanced way, to support the NHS that we all use.""

BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said one option under consideration was to terminate the contracts of the rehabilitation companies in 2020, two years early.The arrangements for managing offenders were overhauled in 2014, with the probation service split in two.A new state body, the National Probation Service (NPS), was set up to supervise high-risk offenders, with 21 Community Rehabilitation Companies (CRCs) supervising low and medium-risk offenders.The ""Transforming Rehabilitation"" project, introduced by Chris Grayling when he was justice secretary, aimed to reduce reoffending rates.But the Justice Select Committee said that programme had left the system in a ""mess"", with staff morale at an ""all-time low"" and support for prisoners leaving jail ""wholly inadequate"".It said that splitting the management of offenders between a national body and 21 rehabilitation companies created a two-tier system, which has left the voluntary sector less involved than before.The MPs said the companies' performance in reducing re-offending is ""disappointing"", with some staff dealing with cases for which they have not been properly trained.Conservative MP and justice committee chairman Bob Neill said: ""The TR reforms had some laudable aims but these reforms have failed to meet them. We are unconvinced that TR will ever deliver the kind of probation service we need.""There are ""major questions"" to be answered on a range of issues, he said, including support given to offenders, the performance of probation providers, CRC contracts, poor staff morale and the voluntary sector's involvement.Mr Neill said: ""This has a negative impact on the number of individuals who go on to reoffend. Hardworking and dedicated staff are doing their best with a probation system that is currently a mess.""The MPs urged the Ministry of Justice to review the long-term future and sustainability of delivering the service, publishing findings by February.Prisons and probation minister Rory Stewart said it was a ""significant programme of reform"".""For instance, an additional 40,000 people who would not previously have been monitored now receive support and supervision upon release,"" he said.""Fewer people are re-offending and there have been some innovative and impressive programmes.""However, we accept that there have been challenges and it is clear that CRC services do need to improve.""We are currently in commercial discussions with providers and will consider all possible options to ensure we deliver this improvement."""
2018-06-20,Minister quits to oppose Heathrow plan,https://web.archive.org//web/20180622101246/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44561170,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowJunior trade minister Greg Hands has resigned from the government to oppose expansion of Heathrow Airport.The vote on whether to build a third runway at the airport west of London is due to be held on Monday.Mr Hands, who represents the Chelsea and Fulham constituency in London, said he had pledged to oppose the new runway at the 2017 election.It had been thought that ministers with constituencies directly affected could have been allowed to miss the vote.As the Government will be whipping the vote on Monday, this means I am resigning from the Government. It has been an honour to serve the Prime Minister (and her predecessor) for the last 7 years and I wish the PM & the Government every continuing success. https://t.co/GQedGcfy80End of Twitter post  by @GregHandsThe highest profile opponent of Heathrow expansion in the cabinet is Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, who once pledged to lie down in front of bulldozers to stop it happening.But Mr Johnson is scheduled to be out of the UK on Monday so will not be attending the vote in the House of Commons.Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson suggested on Twitter that Mr Hands' resignation should prompt the prime minister to allow her MPs a free vote: ""It's not too late for her to change whipping arrangements. This would also allow Boris Johnson to re-enter the country.""Green Party co-leader Caroline Lucas said the foreign secretary should quit too: If Boris Johnson has a backbone, or a shred of credibility left, he will join Greg Hands in resigning. #Heathrow https://t.co/zcOUInt2fEEnd of Twitter post  by @CarolineLucasPrime Minister Theresa May defended the foreign secretary's absence from a vote seen by some as crucial to the UK's post-Brexit international trade campaign, known as Global Britain. She said: ""The government is absolutely committed to increasing airport capacity at Heathrow. This is important, it is part of our future as Global Britain, and the ambitions we have as a trading nation for the future.""The foreign secretary early next week will be what I would describe as the living embodiment of Global Britain. ""He will be out there actually showing the UK's continued presence around the world, and the work that the UK continues to do around the world, with our diplomacy working on so many of the issues and challenges that we face across the world today.""Labour is also divided on the controversial issue, with members of the party's leadership, such as shadow chancellor John McDonnell, opposed to it, but high profile trade union backers in favour. The party's MPs are being allowed to vote however they want to on the issue.The SNP are in favour of Heathrow expansion, with the Lib Dems opposed and with the government deciding to whip (order) Conservative MPs to vote in favour, it is widely expected that the expansion plan will get Commons backing. A Downing Street spokesman said Mr Hands, who has held various ministerial roles and was chief secretary to the Treasury under David Cameron, had ""served the government with great ability and distinction over several years, and we thank him for all of his work"".Mr Hands will be replaced as a minister in the Department for International Trade by George Hollingbery, MP for Meon Valley. Meanwhile Mr Hands has tweeted that he cannot answer media calls about his resignation - because he is visiting a Romanian monastery:Am flattered by all the media calls about my resignation today, but it’s a bit awkward as am on pilgrimage at the Romanian monastery of Voronet. With the phone ringing/vibrating constantly I think the monks think I might be a drug dealer. In short: no media interviews. pic.twitter.com/2P2HxN0StaEnd of Twitter post 2 by @GregHandsThe debate on expanding Heathrow has been going on for nearly 20 years. The last Labour government backed the idea, and won a vote on it in 2009, but that plan was scrapped - and the idea of expansion put on hold for five years - by the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition formed after the 2010 election. But the idea of expansion was resurrected and has been subsequently backed by the Conservatives. Ministers approved a draft national airports policy statement in October but Parliament has  to give its approval for detailed planning to begin. Campaigners argue that a new runway will breach the UK's legal limits on air pollution and increase noise pollution with an extra 700 planes a day. It will result in huge disruption to residents of nearby villages, such as Longford, Harmondsworth and Sipson, with hundreds of homes likely to be knocked down. Robert Barnstone, from the No 3rd Runway Coalition, told the BBC the government was ""failing people and failing the environment as well"". Former Transport Secretary Justine Greening, who backs expanding Gatwick instead, suggested the idea of Heathrow as a national hub airport was outdated and the focus should be on improving regional capacity.And Tory MP Zac Goldsmith, who resigned his Richmond Park seat in 2016 over the issue and subsequently lost a by-election, said for many people ""this doesn't just look like a blank cheque being given by this government to a foreign-owned multinational, it looks like a whole book of cheques signed by our constituents"".Heathrow's owners, which include Spanish infrastructure firm Ferrovial, say the airport is virtually full and a new runway would increase its capacity from 85.5 million to 130 million passengers. The expansion is estimated to create about 60,000 new jobs and generate about £70bn in total economic benefits by the 2050s. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling has said it will provide a ""vital legacy"" for the British economy.Residents whose houses are knocked down will get compensation worth 125% of their value - as well as legal fees and stamp duty costs paid for - while £700m would be available to fund noise insulation measures for those who decide to stay.Mr Grayling has said a ban on night flights was an ""absolute requirement"" and non-negotiable while he said landing charges paid by airlines must stay at current levels.""This runway cannot be built if it does not meet air quality rules,"" he added.Sir Howard Davies, whose 2015 review recommended a new runway as long as environmental and community impacts were addressed, said ""significant"" concessions had been made on reducing early morning flights and minimising the impact on residents on the proposed flight path."

Maybe both sides did, a bit.Lots will be said and written in the next 24 hours about who really backed down after another day of shenanigans in Parliament - whips cornering potential rebels, even today, the grim sight of a Labour MP being forced to come to vote while visibly ill in a wheelchair and on morphine, the Tories so nervous about the vote that they suspended the normal rules that allow for ill MPs to stay out of the Chamber.As Westminster games go, it is getting pretty extreme. But ultimately, your view on whether the compromise had a winner, may depend on the side you are on.Both sides of course will claim they were the victor, the haggling over a deal took so long because both sides wanted to save face.The cabinet minister Liam Fox has just told us that nothing has really changed, it was just ""procedural"" and the fundamentals were exactly the same.In contrast, one of the organisers of the rebel group, Stephen Hammond, tweeted that the government has now conceded that Parliament would have a ""real say with no constraints"", if the final Brexit deal is rejected.The two sides will, guess what, continue to argue it for weeks to come, and every insult, every rankle, every cross word on this episode, being remembered in the difficult months to come.Here are two things however that are hard to dispute.The government was worried enough about losing today to budge, even if they only gave an inch.It might be a concession that only really parliamentary lawyers understand, but the PM had to move, again, despite not wanting to.And despite the fact that she did compromise even in a meaningless way (yes I can't believe that I did just write that sentence, but it is relevant), the vote was still relatively close, certainly not comfortable enough for the government to relax any time soon. What's also the case is that the Tory rebels, or potential rebels more like, weren't willing to take dramatic action in enough number to humiliate the PM.The vote result suggests that they have the hypothetical numbers, but their critics, and their internal opponents in the Tory party would question if they really have the guts.The former boss of the Treasury, Nick McPherson, no fan of Brexit it's important to say, has just acidly written online: ""Axiom of the last 30 years. Europhile Tories always compromise to preserve party unity, Their opponents don't. #thatswhywearewhereweare""But the last 24 hours has also been frustrating for Brexiteers.Many of them believe that Theresa May didn't have to push it this far, that she could have faced down the potential rebels without having to give any ground.There are many behind the scenes urging Number 10 to take a firmer line, to dare them to vote against her.Not the Parliamentary arithmetic, but the Tories' own arithmetic, makes them believe that she'd be easily able to do so, to end it once and for all and make plain that Brexiteers are the dominant force.But to face down the rebels who want to maintain closer ties to the EU or the Brexiteers would require the prime minister to risk something that she wants to avoid - to make the splits in Tory party more exposed, to make one side of the party the overt winner. For many months she has survived by tacking first an inch one way, and then the other.Today's events with a non-compromise-compromise suggest she is simply not ready to abandon that approach.But with so many more difficult decisions to come in the next few months, on both sides, Tories are more and more frustrated that she refuses to choose.One observes that Number 10 might believe the ""lesson of Maastricht"", is to try everything to keep the Tory party together, but the truth they suggest is that the real lesson of Maastricht is that any war is only over when one side is the clear victor.The trouble is, another source suggested, she never wants to say no to anyone, but when it comes to doing this deal, she simply can't say yes to everyone."
2018-06-20,Will there be a 'Brexit dividend'?,https://web.archive.org//web/20180622101246/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44523513,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe claim: Extra funding for the NHS, up to 2023, will be part-funded by a Brexit dividend.Reality Check verdict: Once the UK stops paying into the EU budget, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) says there will be savings. But this doesn't take into account the extra spending associated with leaving the EU and the potential economic impact, as forecast by the OBR.The debate over how to fund the NHS dominated the main exchanges during Wednesday's Prime Minister's Questions, with the subject of the ""Brexit dividend"" being brought up.The government says a combination of tax rises, economic growth and a ""Brexit dividend"" will help cover the costs of the increased spending in England's NHS budget.Under the plans, the NHS annual budget will increase by £20.5bn by 2023. On top of that, about £4bn will be given to the rest of the UK - although it will be up to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to decide how that is spent.So is the UK government right to claim that we can expect a ""dividend"" by leaving the European Union? When the government talks about a ""dividend"", it is referring to the annual contribution that we pay towards the European Union budget every year.According to the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) - the independent body that scrutinises the public finances - the UK contributed just under £9bn net to the EU budget in 2016-17.Under the government's current plans, the UK will remain a member of the EU until 29 March 2019 and it will continue to pay into the EU budget until then.After that there is a proposed transition period in order to give more time to negotiate a post-Brexit relationship with the EU. The transition is scheduled to last until the end of December 2020.The amount we pay during the transition period is expected to be similar to last year's net contribution.The OBR has set out what the potential savings might be. It believes the UK will start saving money from 2020, £3bn initially and rising to £5.8bn a year in 2022-23.That's based on how much we would have contributed to the EU budget, less the financial settlement or ""divorce"" bill.But it's not as simple as that.For one, while the OBR will have made some working assumptions about size of the ""divorce"" settlement, we still don't know what the final bill will be. The latest UK estimate for the total is cost is between £35bn and £39bn. This is based on calculations the UK and EU have agreed, not the final amount on which the two sides have settled.  In April the National Audit Office said that the final bill remains uncertain and much of it depends on future events. For some parts, like pensions, the UK would end up paying for decades.But the government has already committed to pay for certain things associated with the cost of leaving the EU.Last autumn the Chancellor Philip Hammond announced £3bn of funding over the next two years to help government departments prepare for Brexit.Furthermore, a significant amount of the money the UK currently contributes to the EU ends up coming back to the UK to fund things like agricultural subsidies and science and research funding.The government has said it will preserve the funding that farmers currently receive from the EU - at least until 2022. In 2017, that was worth just over £3bn.The UK also has to decide, among other things, if it will replace EU programmes that fund development in poor UK regions as well as research and development grants.On top of all this, there's also considerable uncertainty about how the economy will perform after Brexit. According to the OBR, the saving we get from no longer paying into the EU budget will be outweighed if the economy underperforms.It says that the impact of Brexit on the public finances will be largely determined by what happens to future tax revenues, which are linked to the strength of the economy.And the OBR is already forecasting extra borrowing of about £15bn a year because the UK voted to leave the EU from 2018-19 to 2020-21.It puts this down to things like lower immigration, lower productivity and higher inflation.The government has been disputing whether the economy will take a hit. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Monday: ""A lot of the forecasts have been wrong and in fact the British economy has been... a lot more resilient than many people were forecasting."" But he did not dispute that the economy has been slowing. Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questionsFollow us on Twitter"
2018-06-20,Week ahead,https://web.archive.org//web/20180622101246/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-parliaments-44495167,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowIt's back to Brexit again in both Houses of Parliament, after the issue of a ""meaningful vote"" unexpectedly detonated. Soft Brexit/Remainer Tory MPs, led by the former attorney general Dominic Grieve, thought they had a deal with the prime minister on the issue. They had drawn back from rebelling on Tuesday on the promise of a compromise - but then discovered that the government was not offering them what they thought had been conceded.Essentially the issue is about what happens if the divorce talks with the EU run out of time, or fail to deliver a deal, or if MPs reject the proposed deal. Here comes the science bit - concentrate!On Tuesday, MPs were presented with a Lords amendment that would have given the power to MPs to direct the government's next steps in those contingencies. The government offered a replacement amendment in the Commons (an ""amendment in lieu"" in parliamentary jargon) which gave MPs a vote on the final deal, but, crucially, did not give them the opportunity to direct the government's future strategy - what they would get instead would be a statement within 28 days, setting out how the government ""proposes to proceed in relation to negotiations for the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the EU"".Dominic Grieve responded with his own amendment, which was similar to the Lords proposal, but put stronger conditions on MPs being given the power to direct the government. He set out three options which would only kick in three particular scenarios: Having pulled back from rebellion he was expecting the government to concede most of these powers, but it was not to be - and now his Lords ally Lord Hailsham (the former cabinet minister Douglass Hogg) is to put forward his proposals in the Lords, with the aim of replacing the amendment the government won in the Commons, and kicking it back to MPs. The point is that Mr Grieve and his allies would then have a chance to press it to a vote - and quite possibly win.  Both Houses have to agree on the final form of legislation before it can become law, and this intricate process - ""ping pong"" in Westminster-speak - is how MPs and peers reach an agreed wording. So on Monday we will have the Lords votes on the changes made by the Commons. Peers will probably accept most of them, but the Hailsham amendment looks set fair to be accepted (the previous version was passed by a majority of 91 votes) and it will then be kicked back to the Commons, for consideration on Wednesday.Will it win there? The government has a narrow majority with its DUP allies, but if the group around Mr Grieve vote with Labour and the other opposition parties, they would have a majority. Unless some Labour MPs broke ranks and voted with the government, or abstained. And there is a contingent of pro Brexit MPs and MPs from strongly Leave constituencies who may well do so. The arithmetic looks very tight, and the rival sets of party whips will doubtless be working very hard to minimise the number of rebels on their side. It's worth remembering that the Grieve group, unlike the Brexiteers, are not bloodied in rebellion from years of backbench insurgency - so it will be interesting to see if the iron has entered their souls, or whether they can be persuaded to relent. In the end it might even come down to MPs being taken ill or stuck on a train - but unless a new compromise is struck over the weekend, and the implication of bad faith around the previous deal may make that hard to do - we could be in for a week of drama which could prove highly destabilising to the government.Something else to watch out for is an effort to secure an Estimates Day debate on the Defence Budget; debates on these days are under a procedure which allows detailed discussion of money issues, and both the Defence Select Committee and the Public Accounts Committee are extremely concerned about the state of the Ministry of Defence finances. As luck would have it, members of both were recently together at Rossyth, for a visit to the new aircraft carrier, HMS Queen Elizabeth II, and the rumour is that a coordinated move to get the issue onto the floor of the Commons has been cooked up. Here's my rundown of the week ahead:The Commons opens (2.30 pm) with Housing, Communities and Local Government questions - and any statements or urgent questions will follow at 3.30 pm. Then comes the Emergency Debate secured by the SNP leader, Ian Blackford, on the Sewel Convention - the convention that Westminster seeks ""legislative consent"" for new laws touching on the devolved governments of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.  This follows the passage of amendments to the EU (Withdrawal) Bill on which EU powers will and will not be passed to the devolved parliaments, which were opposed by the Scottish Parliament. After  last week's furious scenes, this could provide another flashpoint between the SNP and, in particular, the Scottish Tory MPs and the government whips - the whips have developed a habit of standing close to the SNP benches and heckling their MPs, which is much resented. MPs then deal with Lords amendments to the Automated and Electric Vehicles Bill - in what should be a pretty brief encounter, before moving on to votes on a statutory instrument on the Draft European Union (Definition of Treaties) (Canada Trade Agreement) Order and European Documents relating to EU Trade Agreements: EU-Japan Economic Partnership Agreement. And after that there is a general debate on how the NHS and other public services deal with acquired brain injuries.In Westminster Hall (4.30 pm) MPs debate e-petition 209433: ""Give the electorate a referendum on the abolition of the House of Lords - the House of Lords is a place of patronage where unelected and unaccountable individuals hold a disproportionate amount of influence and power which can be used to frustrate the elected representatives of the people."" The petition attracted 168,755 signatures.My committee pick is the Transport Committee hearing (4.45pm) on Rail timetable changes - when MPs will question top executives from GTR, Arriva Rail North, London North Western and Network Rail. It was announced on Friday that Charles Horton is to resign as chief executive of Govia Thameslink Railway, following months of controversy over delays and cancellations to services. Bring popcorn. In the Lords, after a half hour question time at 2.30pm, peers embark on their consideration of Commons amendments to the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill  (see above).MPs kick off (at 11.30 am) with Health and Social Care questions, after which the Conservative Craig Mackinlay presents a Ten Minute Rule Bill to give Gibraltar an MP (this had been due to be debated some months ago, and was rescheduled). Then comes a Labour Opposition Day Debate on a motion (or motions) to be announced.In Westminster Hall, the opening debate (9.30am) is on Romania: the member state which will hold the EU Presidency next year, and therefore has a crucial brokering role in the final Brexit negotiations. The debate will be opened by the Conservative, Bob Blackman, who believes Romania is very keen to help, and will want to extend bilateral arrangements with the UK, post Brexit. He also wants to discuss Romanian concerns about Russian activity in the Black Sea.Labour's Helen Goodman (2.30pm) leads a debate on geothermal energy, which she says has a huge potential to provide a carbon free energy source - including in former coal communities, where decommissioned mine shafts can be used. But, she says, it does not feature in the government's energy strategy. Her aim in this debate is to raise the profile and press ministers to take the opportunities seriously.My committee corridor pick is the International Development hearing (10am) on the humanitarian situation in Gaza, with witnesses from the UN, followed by the Foreign Office and International Development and minister, Alistair Burt.In the Lords (2.30pm) peers debate the detail of the Rating (Property in Common Occupation) and Council Tax (Empty Dwellings) Bill - the measure that will allow local councils to increase the tax on empty homes. Then there is a short debate on encouraging a recovery in the population of bees and other pollinators.The Commons begins (11.30am) with half an hour of Northern Ireland questions, before moving on to the high noon of Prime Minister's Question time.The day's Ten Minute Rule Bill, from the SNP's Martin Docherty-Hughes aims to create an Armed Forces Representative Body. Time has then been set aside to consider Lords amendments to the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill (see above) and there will be a general debate on Nato.One thing to keep an eye on is a possible statement from a health minister on the findings of Bishop James Jones' independent inquiry into deaths at the Gosport Memorial Hospital. The inquiry was commissioned during the coalition years, following concerns about the over-use of morphine on patients. Look out for Lib Dem former health minister Norman Lamb...In Westminster Hall, there are debates on the UN report on the convention on the rights of persons with disabilities (9.30am-11am);  the UK constitutional machinery and the frameworks for intergovernmental cooperation (2.30pm-4pm); UK and Polish war reparations against Germany (4pm-4.30pm) and insecure work and the gig economy (4.30pm-5.30pm). On the committee corridor, the Housing, Communities and Local Government Committee (9.30am) takes evidence one year on, on local authority support for Grenfell Tower survivors - there are witnesses from Grenfell United, the North Kensington Law Centre, Councillor Elizabeth Campbell, the Leader of Kensington and Chelsea Council, and Nick Hurd, the minister of state for Policing and Fire Service, with responsibility for Grenfell Tower victims work, at the Home Office. And meanwhile, there's a lively session in prospect, when arch europhile MEP Guy ""the Hoff"" Verhofstadt, the coordinator and chair of the European Parliament Brexit Steering Group, gives evidence to the Brexit Committee on the progress of the UK's negotiations on EU withdrawal (9.15 am) - and he turns up again in the afternoon, before the Home Affairs Committee (2.30pm) to talk about Post-Brexit migration policy. The European Parliament has to sign off on the EU side of Britain's divorce deal, so his views will matter.In the Lords (3pm), the main event is the second reading of the Courts and Tribunals (Judiciary and Functions of Staff) Bill, which seeks to remove restrictions on how judges can be deployed, so they can hear a wider range of cases. The Commons opens (9.30am) with Digital, Culture, Media and Sport questions, followed by questions to the Attorney General (10.10am) and the weekly Business Questions to the Leader of the House. The main debates are on backbench motions on the importance of refugee family reunion - the SNP's Angus Brendan MacNeil proposes a motion welcoming the fact that the Refugees (Family Reunion) (No.2) Bill was given its second reading without opposition on 16 March 2018, and calling on the government to support the bill.Then Labour MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle has a motion on the future of the Erasmus+ student exchange scheme, after 2020, calling on the government to ensure continued UK access, after Brexit.In the Lords (11am) question time marks national Yoga Day with a query on the benefits of yoga for obese school children. Peers then debate the support available to carers and the Carers Action Plan 2018 - 2020; and the implications for the UKs future trade relations following the failure to reach agreement at the G7 Summit in Canada. And then they discuss the contribution of the armed forces reserves to national security. Neither House sits on Friday 22 June."

But in the process he's angered anti-war activists and critics of British and Western foreign policy, who claim he's been biased against them. ""Christmas Day, Eid day, Easter Day, Cup final day, early hours of the morning, in the middle of the night - this man is on my case,"" says George Galloway, the former Labour and Respect Party MP. ""And it doesn't take an Einstein to work out he's not tending this garden with loving care or to make it look as nice as it can look. It's the opposite."" The subject of Galloway's ire is a prolific Wikipedia editor who goes by the name ""Philip Cross"". He's been the subject of a huge debate on the internet encyclopaedia - one of the world's most popular websites - and also on Twitter. And he's been accused of bias for interacting, sometimes negatively, with some of the people whose Wikipedia pages he's edited. The Philip Cross account was created at precisely 18:48 GMT on 26 October 2004. Since then, he's made more than 130,000 edits to more 30,000 pages. That's a substantial amount, but not hugely unusual - it's not enough edits, for example, to put him in the top 300 editors on Wikipedia. But it's what he edits which has preoccupied anti-war politicians and journalists. In his top 10 most-edited pages are the jazz musician Duke Ellington, The Sun newspaper, and Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre. But also in that top 10 are a number of vocal critics of American and British foreign policy: the journalist John Pilger, Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn and Corbyn's director of strategy, Seamus Milne.His critics also say that Philip Cross has made favourable edits to pages about public figures who are supportive of Western military intervention in the Middle East. He's recently caught the attention of bloggers and has been the subject of stories in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz and Russian state-owned outlets Sputnik and RT. There have been allegations on social media - all unproven - that he's a government agent, employed by rich and powerful media interests, or is a mainstream journalist with an obsessive hobby.You may also be interested in:""His edits are remorselessly targeted at people who oppose the Iraq war, who've opposed the subsequent intervention wars … in Libya and Syria, and people who criticise Israel,"" Galloway says. Recently Galloway offered a reward of £1000 to anyone who could provide information to reveal the editor's identity.The former MP says he's received information about Philip Cross and that the reward has already been claimed, but that he is not revealing the personal details of the person behind the account.When it comes to Galloway's page, the Philip Cross account is responsible for 20.4% of all edits.But it's difficult to get an overall sense of whether those changes were solely motivated by any particular political bias on behalf of the person behind the account.  More on this storyFor example, a sentence where Galloway criticised the Labour Party as ""Tony Blair's lie machine"" was removed, with Cross citing ""partial repetition, poor source"". In another case, Cross removed links to lurid tabloid headlines about Galloway's private life. In addition, many of the edits were simply grammatical or stylistic.  At one point Cross noted: ""It helps the article if each sentence or paragraph does not begin with 'Galloway' or 'He'.""Wikipedia, which was launched in 2001, relies on volunteers to write and edit entries. Wikipedians have developed an enormous set of rules and procedures guiding the development of a site which now has more than 5.5m articles in English.In addition to his Wikipedia edits, Philip Cross has a Twitter account which he has used to interact with Galloway and other politicians and journalists. In one tweet, for instance, he called a group of anti-war activists ""goons"". That raised claims of a conflict of interest, which is potentially against Wikipedia guidelines. The account is currently subject to a review process run by Wikipedia volunteers, although Philip Cross has promised to stop editing Galloway's entry for an ""indeterminate length of time regardless of any decision"".The Wikimedia Foundation - which established and funds Wikipedia - declined an interview request, but said in a statement:""Independent volunteer editors consistently monitor Wikipedia, often aided by technology, to ensure its articles remain neutral and well-sourced for the hundreds of millions of people who rely on it every month. ""If repeat violations to Wikipedia policies do occur, volunteers have a variety of mechanisms to draw from, including issuing warnings and blockings, to address content and behaviour that does not meet Wikipedia standards."" On Twitter, Wikipedia's co-founder, Jimmy Wales, rejected claims that Philip Cross is making entries biased.Of course there's only one person who could definitively lay to rest questions about the origins of the account - and that is Philip Cross himself.BBC Trending has been able to establish that he lives in England, and that Philip Cross is not the name he normally goes by outside of Wikipedia.

2018-06-20,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20180622101246/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-44470777,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe claim: The UK's 20-year devolution convention has been ""ripped up"".Reality Check verdict: The convention has been undermined but there is no legal reason why the UK government cannot ignore the Scottish Parliament over Brexit. Scotland's first minister says the passage of the UK's key Brexit legislation without the consent of the Scottish Parliament has ""ripped up the 20-year-old devolution convention"" in the UK. Is she right?Ms Sturgeon's tweet came after the House of Commons spent less than 20 minutes debating the EU Withdrawal Bill's impact on devolution. The SNP said that showed ""contempt for Scottish democracy"", with the party's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, leading a walk-out of his MPs during Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday.The row centres on a so-called ""power grab"", with the Scottish government accusing Westminster of keeping some powers for itself that should go to the Scottish Parliament at Holyrood, after Brexit.  The UK government says the ""temporary"" move will allow the same rules and regulations to remain in place across the whole of the UK in 24 key areas, such as agriculture, fisheries and food labelling.And it points out that the vast majority of the 153 areas where policy in devolved areas is currently decided in Brussels will go directly to the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly, meaning both will have considerably more powers after Brexit than they do now. Months of talks have failed to reach a deal - although the Welsh government dropped its opposition after changes were made that would put a limit on how long the UK government would keep the powers.Last month, the Scottish Parliament voted overwhelmingly to refuse consent for the Brexit bill, with the SNP being joined by Labour, the Greens and Liberal Democrat MSPs and only the Conservatives voting against. The UK government pressed on regardless - so how was it able to do so? When the devolved Scottish Parliament was set up in 1999, it was handed control over many policy areas such as health and education that had previously been decided at Westminster.However, an agreement signed by the two governments in 2001 stated that ""the United Kingdom Parliament retains authority to legislate on any issue, whether devolved or not"" and that it was ""ultimately for parliament to decide what use to make of that power"". It also stated that the UK government ""will proceed in accordance with the convention that the UK Parliament would not normally legislate with regard to devolved matters except with the agreement of the devolved legislature"". This agreement was inserted into the Scotland Act in 2016, which was drawn up after the independence referendum two years earlier.The word ""normally"" is, of course, an important caveat that is open to different interpretations - is Brexit ""normal"", for example?Scottish Secretary David Mundell said these were not normal times and a failure to proceed with the bill would jeopardise businesses across the UK.He accused the Scottish government of wanting a veto over arrangements that would apply to the whole of the UK and insisted the UK government ""followed the spirit and letter of the devolution settlement at every stage"" despite the failure to secure consent.  Consent is sought through something known as the Sewel Convention, named after former Labour government minister Lord Sewel, which, in effect, allowed the UK government to ask MSPs for permission to change the law in an area that is devolved to Holyrood. Similar conventions apply in both Wales and Northern Ireland. Until Brexit came along, the Scottish Parliament had only once before refused to give its consent - over some aspects of the Welfare Reform Bill in 2011, which resulted in the Scottish government introducing its own legislation to resolve the row. So Ms Sturgeon is correct to say that pushing through the EU Withdrawal Bill without the consent of the Scottish Parliament means that the long-standing convention has, in effect, been ""ripped up"".However, as its name suggests, it is merely a convention and there is no legal requirement for the UK government to seek Holyrood's permission - or to respect its decision if it says ""no"". This was confirmed by the Supreme Court last year, when it ruled on the case brought by Gina Miller about the triggering of Article 50, which started the Brexit process. Judges ruled that the Sewel Convention was not a legally enforceable rule despite being inserted into the Scotland Act.This meant that the Scottish Parliament did not have a veto over Article 50 or, by extension, the EU Withdrawal Bill. Regardless, ignoring the result of the Scottish Parliament vote was sure to provoke fury from the SNP, with Ms Sturgeon warning that ""the decision to act without our consent, and the manner of doing it, will not be forgotten"".Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questionsFollow us on Twitter"
2018-06-20,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20180622101246/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks  are now focusing on the detail of those issues and on future relations - after agreement was reached on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree within six months on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide, but first let's go back to the basics...It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.1% in the first three months of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.4%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand near a 40-year year low of 4.2%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 4.2% in the year to March 2018, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues. The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May was now put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. It will end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain-supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each playing roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanAn agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pounds buy fewer euros. A slump in the value of the dollar means the exchange rate with the pound is pretty close to where it was before the referendum.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.The UK has proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.A method for calculating the bill has been agreed, but the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more.The question of how and when payments will be made still needs to resolved, but it will be a schedule lasting for many years to come, and it is highly unlikely that anyone will ever be able to give an exact figure for the size of the divorce bill.UK sources say it will be up to £40bn, but some EU sources expect it to be higher than that. No-one can say for sure, and both sides want to keep it that way.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 6.5% in 2016 to 2.7% in 2017, according to the Halifax. It said the slowdown was driven by a squeeze on real wage growth.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-06-20,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180622101246/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to £840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

As I write, Mrs May is holed up with her advisers inside Tory HQ. But a former minister Anna Soubry has called for her to ""consider her position"" - political code for calling for her to resign.

On the two previous occasions in 1970 and February 1974 the PM and the party lost office. While there is no other conceivable administration in the new parliament other than a Conservative-led one, it remains to be seen whether the PM will retain her position. However, so long as the Conservatives can reach an accommodation with the DUP they will have a working majority in the House of Commons.

Michael Russell said the Scottish government no longer trusted UK ministers after they pushed through the Brexit bill last week.He was speaking as Nicola Sturgeon arrived in Guernsey for talks with UK Cabinet Minister David Lidington.Mr Lidington said governments should ""co-operate on the big issues"".He insisted the UK government was committed to maintaining a good working relationship with the devolved administrations despite the ""inevitable political noise"" over Brexit.And he urged the Scottish government ""to maintain their own side of that relationship"".Relations between the two governments are said to be at their lowest ever level after the Commons last week spent less than 20 minutes debating the EU Withdrawal Bill's impact on devolution, despite the Scottish Parliament voting to withhold consent. Ms Sturgeon has accused the UK government of ""ripping up"" the devolution settlement.The first minister also said she was ""proud"" of SNP MPs who walked out of Prime Minister's Questions in protest over the UK government's handling of the bill - a move that was derided as a ""pre-arranged stunt"" by opponents. Senior SNP and Scottish government figures have said the protest was not a one-off, and it would not be ""business as usual"" for devolution.Speaking to the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme, Mr Russell said he ""couldn't conceive of circumstances"" where MSPs would vote to give approval for further UK legislation related to leaving the EU, such as trade, agriculture and fisheries.He added: ""We are absolutely clear that the way that devolution operates and the structures of devolution have failed, and they failed because the UK government is refusing to operate them.""For example, on the Sewel Convention, we need to have the interpretation of that written down in statute and made legally binding, because what we've presently got is a situation where the UK government makes the rules and then breaks them themselves, and there are no sanctions.""He said that, while there was ""practical work"" to do to prepare for Brexit, ""it is very difficult to do that work because, frankly, we don't trust the UK government with it"".Ms Sturgeon and Mr Lidington are at a meeting of the British-Irish Council in Guernsey, which is also being attended by Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones and representatives from Guernsey, Jersey and the Isle of Man.Ahead of the meeting, Ms Sturgeon and Mr Jones issued a joint statement in which they repeated their call for the UK to remain in the single market and customs union after Brexit - which has already been ruled out by Prime Minister Theresa May. Airbus announced on Friday morning that it could leave the UK if the country exits the European Union single market and customs union without a transition deal.Mr Russell said the announcement was further evidence of the ""carnage"" in terms of jobs and the economy that Brexit could bring. The EU Withdrawal has been at the centre of a long-running row between Edinburgh and London, and has been pushed through by the UK government despite MSPs at Holyrood refusing to grant consent.It is the first time this has happened since the Scottish Parliament was created in 1999.Please upgrade your browserMr Lidington said voters expected the governments across the UK to work together and highlighted how Scotland had voted to remain part of the UK.He said: ""Working together is exactly what people all across the UK want to see their respective governments doing.""They want to see their lives being improved through joint endeavour. They don't expect different governments - with politicians from different parties - to agree on everything.""But they do expect us to keep talking - and listening - to each other, and to co-operate on the big issues that affect us all.""The UK government is committed to ""not normally"" passing laws that impact on devolved powers under something known as the Sewel Convention.But it argues that Brexit means these are not ""normal"" times, and that it needed to act despite not having Holyrood consent in order to allow a smooth transition after the UK leaves the EU.The row over the Brexit bill centres on 153 powers in what are now devolved areas, but which were sent to Brussels when the UK joined the EU in 1973. Westminster effectively wants to keep ""temporary"" control of 24 of these powers when they return to the UK after Brexit, with the remainder of the 153 going directly to the Scottish Parliament.It says having control in key areas such as farming and food labelling for the first few years after Brexit will ensure the same rules continue to be followed across the UK.The Scottish government wants all of the powers straight away - although it agrees that UK-wide rules and regulations are needed - and has repeatedly accused the UK government of a ""power grab""."

The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019.The UK government is considering two other options: a customs partnership that would remove the need for new customs checks at the border; and a ""highly streamlined"" customs arrangement that would minimise customs checks rather than getting rid of them altogether.Michel Barnier, the EU's Brexit negotiator, has said that both options are unrealistic.A spokesperson for Prime Minister Theresa May said: ""We are confident that we are going to get a good deal, one that ensures that trade is as free and frictionless as possible, including for the aerospace sector,"" A Welsh government spokesperson said the Airbus announcement was ""extremely worrying"".""We have repeatedly warned that the UK cannot take the huge economic risk of cutting ourselves adrift from the single market and customs union. Particularly in the case of manufacturing sectors, which in Wales are so important in providing high-paid, high-skilled jobs.""The BBC's business editor, Simon Jack, says the Airbus announcement reflects ""growing exasperation"" over Brexit in the UK's boardrooms.He adds that Business Secretary Greg Clark has been similarly exasperated by companies' tendency to complain to him about the issue, only to soften their tone when faced with the prime minister.""He, I think, will be delighted that a company with Airbus's footprint has gone as public as this,"" our business editor said.In its Brexit ""risk assessment"" published on Thursday, Airbus said if the UK left the EU next year without a deal - meaning it left both the single market and customs union immediately and without any agreed transition - it would ""lead to severe disruption and interruption of UK production"". ""This scenario would force Airbus to reconsider its investments in the UK, and its long-term footprint in the country,"" it added.The company, which makes wings for the A320, A330/A340, A350 and A380 passenger planes in the UK, also said the current planned transition period, due to end in December 2020, was too short for it to make changes to its supply chain. As a result, it would ""refrain from extending"" its UK supplier base. It said it currently had more than 4,000 suppliers in the UK.Tom Williams, chief operating officer of Airbus Commercial Aircraft, said in ""any scenario"", Brexit had ""severe negative consequences"" for the UK aerospace industry and Airbus in particular.Without a deal, he said Airbus believed the impact on its UK operations could be ""significant"". ""Put simply, a no-deal scenario directly threatens Airbus' future in the UK.""Mr Williams told the BBC's Today programme that Airbus was currently working on developing the ""next generation"" of aircraft wings in the UK.""We are seriously considering whether we should continue that development or whether we should find alternative solutions,"" he added.Airbus UK's senior vice-president, Katherine Bennett, said the company had ""huge concerns"" about a possible no-deal Brexit: ""We're very fearful there will be chaos at the borders and we want our factories to be able to operate as smoothly as possible.""Conservative MP Stephen Crabb said the warning from Airbus should be a ""wake-up call"".Mr Crabb tweeted: ""The enormous Airbus factory in North Wales is one of the jewels in the crown of UK manufacturing. This is a wake-up call. A pragmatic, sensible Brexit that protects trade & jobs is vital.""And shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer tweeted: ""If proof was needed that the PM's Brexit red lines need to be abandoned (and fast), this is it.""The warnings from Airbus echo comments made on Wednesday by the boss of Siemens in the UK.  Jürgen Maier said the UK should remain in the customs union after Brexit unless there was a ""proper alternative"".Last week, Paul Drechsler, the outgoing president of the CBI, said some parts of industry in the UK faced extinction if the country left the EU customs union.Paul Drechsler said car firm bosses had come to him saying the industry would suffer unless there was ""real frictionless trade"".Mr Drechsler also said there was ""zero evidence"" that trade deals outside the EU would provide any economic benefit to Britain."
2018-06-21,£2.4m spent on Commons gagging clauses,https://web.archive.org//web/20180622101246/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44571120,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe House of Commons spent £2.4m on ""gagging clauses"" for former staff since 2013, BBC Newsnight has learned.Fifty-three departing members of the House of Commons Service signed contracts compelling them not to reveal information about the Commons.So-called ""non-disclosure agreements"" (NDAs) can be used to silence victims of bullying or harassment.A House spokesman said the clauses were used ""to resolve employment disputes under certain circumstances"".Newsnight uncovered the information via a Freedom of Information Act request, which was made as part of its investigation into bullying and harassment by MPs of members of the House of Commons Service - the apolitical employees who run the Commons and its committees. These people are usually referred to in Westminster as ""clerks"".Newsnight has previously reported that Angus Sinclair, formerly the Speaker's secretary, was paid £86,000 - more than a year of pay - as part of a settlement that entailed him signing a non-disclosure agreement. He felt he was being paid off to stay quiet about being bullied by the Speaker of the House of Commons (an allegation that the Speaker denies). The answer to the request reveals that £2.4m was spent on 53 settlements including gagging clauses with departing staff members since 2013. (The Press Association has, by the same means, got the same information which they are publishing independently.) The average settlement cost £45,418.Jill Rutter of the Institute for Government, said: ""The public sector should not be allowed to waste taxpayers' money on NDAs"". She said it was ""impossible to justify as [value for money]"".These figures are a slight underestimate. There may also be some other cases in 2012 and 2018, but the numbers involved are small enough that they fear publishing them would allow people to figure out information about identifiable individuals. The House of Commons reply to Newsnight clarifies that the NDAs were ""settlement agreements (formerly known as compromise agreements) which include a confidentiality clause"". It is unclear how many of these contracts were signed, as Mr Sinclair believes was the case for him, in order to prevent information about bullying or harassment leaking out.Newsnight has established, however, that confidentiality clauses were not standard in House of Commons exit deals: the annual report for the financial year 2016-17 shows 43 people left the House on ""exit packages"", but only 23 were given NDAs in all of 2016 and 2017.  We also know that people, known to Newsnight, who had made complaints about sexual harassment or bullying at the House were asked to sign NDAs when they left with an exit deal. Some other NDAs, however, were really a means of getting rid of a staff member more easily. Getting them to sign a non-disclosure agreement could be used as a justification for a bigger pay-off. Gagging clauses are sometimes suggested by unions to get more money out of employers for a departing member of staff. So while some of these NDAs may have been intended to keep the culture under wraps, it is not clear how many that applies to. The House of Commons, however, is now likely to face questions about its use of NDAs. The House of Commons does not have trade secrets, for example, that might justify the use of gagging clauses. Maria Miller, chair of the women and equalities committee, which is researching the use of NDAs, said: ""There needs to be more transparency on why payments such as this are being made in the first place.""

2018-06-21,Watchdog expected to find Vote Leave broke rules,https://web.archive.org//web/20180622101246/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44567588,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAn investigation into whether the official Leave campaign in the EU Referendum broke electoral rules is scheduled to be published within weeks. The draft Electoral Commission's report concludes that Vote Leave and another smaller campaign group did break the rules, the BBC understands, and is expected to recommend at least one fine.  The latest investigation comes after allegations were made by the whistleblowers Christopher Wylie and Shahmir Sanni that the official Brexit campaign broke the law by colluding with a smaller group, BeLeave. It is understood that the commission did consider this new evidence, but it is not thought that the new information was decisive in proving a breach of the law. This is the first full formal investigation into Vote Leave, although the Electoral Commission had twice examined the campaign's behaviour. One source said that the draft report was ""bizarre"" and had ""gone way off track"" by focusing on the original information that has already been pored over, rather than additional evidence. It's suggested that the commission did not interview, nor request interviews, with the senior members of the Vote Leave Campaign team. Lawyers for those criticised in the report are understood to be challenging the draft findings, and publication could therefore be subject to delay. It is not clear if the commission plans only to recommend civil sanctions like fines, or also suggest referring the matter to the police or Crown Prosecution Service. Suggestions that the official Leave campaign, which featured senior Cabinet ministers, broke the law, would be highly controversial. Vote Leave and BeLeave have both always denied the allegations. An Electoral Commission spokesperson said: ""In accordance with its Enforcement Policy, the Electoral Commission has written to Vote Leave, Mr Darren Grimes and Veterans for Britain to advise each campaigner of the outcome of the investigation announced on 20 November 2017. ""The campaigners have 28 days to make representations before final decisions are taken. ""The commission will announce the outcome of the investigation and publish an investigation report once this final decision has been taken.""  Lawyer Tamsin Allen, who acts for Mr Sanni, Mr Wylie and a third whistleblower, said ""The legal opinion and evidence submitted to the EC demonstrated the grounds for suspecting that Vote Leave and BeLeave conducted an unlawful spending scheme.  ""If the Electoral Commission has indeed found those in the scheme guilty of  electoral offences, this is vindication for the whistleblowers, but a serious blow for the public and for the integrity of the referendum vote."""
2018-06-21,UK's plan for EU citizens who want to stay,https://web.archive.org//web/20180622101246/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44553225,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowEU citizens will have to answer three ""simple"" questions online if they want to continue living in the UK after Brexit, the home secretary has said.Sajid Javid said the government's ""default"" position would be to grant, not refuse, settled status.People will be asked to prove their ID, whether they have criminal convictions and whether they live in the UK.Their answers will be checked against government databases and a decision given ""very quickly"", said Mr Javid.The scheme will operate online and via a smartphone app, Mr Javid said, and would be ""as simple as people can reasonably expect"", with most decisions turned around within two weeks or sooner.Speaking to a House of Lords committee, Mr Javid said there would have to be ""a very good reason"" why an application would be refused.The Home Office said the criminal record checks would be about ""serious and persistent criminality, not parking fines"".The £170m scheme will be compulsory for all EU citizens living in the UK - the government expects a total of 3.5 million applications.EU citizens and family members who have been in the UK for five years by the end of 2020 will be able to apply for ""settled status"", meaning they are free to go on living and working in the UK indefinitely.Those who have arrived by December 31, 2020, but do not have five years' residence, can seek to stay until they have, at which point they can seek settled status.The scheme also includes citizens of Switzerland, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.Applications will cost £65 for adults and £32.50 for children and be free for EU nationals who already have residency or indefinite leave to remain.Applicants will be asked to provide their biographical information, declare whether they have any criminal records, and upload a facial photograph.The process requires verification of the applicant's identity and nationality using a passport, ID card or other valid document, which can be done using a smartphone app or through secure post.The government hopes to start trials within a few weeks, with people allowed to start registering in the autumn.Mr Javid told the Lords EU Justice sub-committee he wanted it to be fully operational by the ""start of next year"", adding that he wanted to avoid a ""surge"" of applicants when the UK leaves the EU in March.The scheme would run for at least two years after Brexit day, probably to around June 2021, said the home secretary.The hope is that most applicants will not have to provide supporting documents because their answers will be checked against HM Revenue and Customs and other government databases.Applicants with Android phones will be able to download an app which can read the chip in their passport to verify their identity - and they will be able to take a ""selfie"" that can be checked against Home Office records, said Mr Javid.But he said there was an ""an issue at the moment"" with Apple device users, who will not be able to make use of this app, and instead will have to send in their passport to prove their identity.The home secretary said he had raised the issue with Apple on a recent visit to Silicon Valley and the company was ""looking at it actively"".Analysis by BBC Home Affairs correspondent Danny ShawWhat the Home Office is embarking on is a hugely complex project within a tight timescale.  When challenged about the potential for it go wrong, officials point to the Passport Office as an example of a service successfully processing millions of cases every year. But unlike the biometric passport system, the EU registration scheme is being built from scratch. For hundreds of thousands of EU nationals, who have a straightforward and legitimate employment history in Britain and are comfortable using digital technology, their applications may well be resolved ""within days"", the time officials rather ambitiously claim cases will take. But for claimants hoping to bring in relatives, people unfamiliar with computers and those with a more sketchy background in Britain, perhaps involving some cash-in-hand work, the process may be a hurdle they'll struggle with - or avoid altogether.“After two years of being left in limbo, we don’t take things on trust… we want legally binding guarantees” @maikebohn on ‘settled status’ and rights of EU citizens in UK after Brexit #bbcdp pic.twitter.com/iCyREHpf4iEnd of Twitter post  by @daily_politicsLabour MP Yvette Cooper, chair of the Commons home affairs committee, said ""far more"" answers were needed from the government ""about what happens to those who aren't registered by June 2021 through no fault of their own, such as children"". ""At the moment it appears that if children aren't registered within the next three years then they will lose their legal rights even though they may have been here all their lives."" SNP home affairs spokeswoman Jo Cherry, speaking in the Commons, said: ""There are potentially significant numbers of people who could fall through the cracks here. ""If just 5% of the estimated three million EU citizens living in the UK don't register by the deadline there would be a population of nearly 200,000 left without status.""Former Labour minister Hilary Benn, who chairs the Commons Brexit Committee, asked ministers if the scheme would still stand in the event of a no-deal Brexit.Immigration Minister Caroline Nokes said: ""We have confidence that there will be a deal.""Sajid Javid promised there would be no repeat of the Windrush scandal - which saw people who had lived in the UK for decades threatened with deportation because they did not have the right paperwork - for EU migrants, adding ""lessons had been learned"".The new ""settled status"" scheme would establish the right of EU migrants to remain in the UK, unlike in the case of Windrush families where there was only an assumption they had a right to stay, without any documentary proof, he told the committee.The home secretary accused EU nations, such as France and Spain, of failing to match the UK's progress on plans for expats after Brexit.There are about 900,000 UK citizens in the EU, according to ONS figures.Both sides of the Brexit negotiations have resolved to secure the status of expats by the time the UK leaves the EU in March 2019.But any deal they reach will have to be ratified by the European Parliament and agreed to by member states.If the UK leaves the EU without a deal then the status of British citizens living in the EU member states is less certain.The UK would expect member states to allow Britons living in the EU the same rights as it plans to grant EU citizens in the UK but it would be down to individual countries to decide what to do."

Producing clothes requires toxic chemicals and produces climate-changing emissions. ""Every time we put on a wash, thousands of plastic fibres wash down the drain and into the oceans. We don't know where or how to recycle end of life clothing.""Our inquiry will look at how the fashion industry can remodel itself to be both thriving and sustainable.""The committee is inviting people to comment by September on the environmental impact of the fashion industry, waste, unwanted clothing and working conditions in UK garment factories.Among the questions it will ask is whether fast fashion is unsustainable, and what can be done to encourage people to buy fewer clothes and think more about how they are disposed of."
2018-06-21,Service celebrates Windrush anniversary,https://web.archive.org//web/20180622101246/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-44571616,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowA thanksgiving service is being held later to mark the 70th anniversary of the arrival in the UK of Caribbean migrants on the Empire Windrush ship.Prime Minister Theresa May, Labour's Diane Abbott and families of the Windrush generation will attend the event at Westminster Abbey.The migrants were among the first to be recruited to rebuild post-war Britain.But there continues to be concern over a scandal which saw some of the generation wrongly face deportation. Nearly 500 Caribbean migrants from countries including Jamaica, Bermuda and Trinidad exited the Windrush on the 22 June 1948 when it docked at Tilbury in Essex. They had applied to job adverts after World War Two with the hope of finding long-term employment in the UK, having gained a type of citizenship under the British Nationality Act of 1948.The Westminster Abbey service will commemorate the contribution the migrants and their families have made to the UK. Meanwhile, a celebration of Caribbean culture will be held at Tilbury Docks to mark the anniversary.The government has also announced Baroness Floella Benjamin is to lead a commemoration committee overseeing the creation of a ""fitting legacy"" to the Windrush generation. A statue celebrating their achievements is among the ideas for the permanent tribute.Baroness Benjamin, a former children's television presenter and Lib Dem peer, was born in Trinidad but emigrated to the UK with her family in 1960. She said: ""This a significant step in recognising the contribution made to Britain by Caribbean people and this committee will make sure the work and sacrifices of the Windrush pioneers will live on in the hearts and minds of future generations.""The right to remain in the UK for Commonwealth migrants who arrived before 1973 was supposed to be legally guaranteed. But it emerged this year that some migrants from the Windrush generation - many of them who arrived as children  - had faced deportation. They were being refused healthcare and access to jobs because they did not have the paperwork to prove their status following a tightening of immigration rules in 2014.The government has since apologised for the crisis and says a dedicated taskforce has now provided documentation to over 2,000 people demonstrating their right to live in the UK. Earlier this week, the government announced an annual Windrush Day would take place."

Tariffs have been imposed on products such as bourbon whiskey, motorcycles and orange juice.European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker said duties imposed by the US on the EU go against ""all logic and history"".Addressing the Irish parliament in Dublin, he added that ""we will do what we have to do to rebalance and safeguard"" the EU.The Trump administration announced in March that it would introduce tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminium imported into the US.Mr Trump has argued that global oversupply of steel and aluminium, driven by China, threatens American steel and aluminium producers, which are vital to the US.After being deferred, the duties on steel and aluminium went ahead on 1 June and affect the EU, Canada, Mexico and other close US allies, including India.For its part, India has said it will raise taxes on 29 products imported from the US - including some agricultural goods, steel and iron products - in retaliation for the wide-ranging US tariffs.The new duties will come into effect from 4 August and will affect US almonds, walnuts and chick peas, among other products. South Korea, Argentina, Australia and Brazil have agreed to put limits on the volume of metals they can ship to the US in lieu of tariffs.However, Canada has announced it will impose retaliatory tariffs on C$16.6bn (£9.5bn) worth of US exports from 1 July.And Mexico put tariffs on $3bn worth of American products ranging from steel to pork and bourbon two weeks ago.Earlier this week, Mr Trump threatened to impose 10% duties on an additional $200bn (£150bn) worth of Chinese goods which he said would come into force if China ""refuses to change its practices"".However, China accused the US of an act of ""extreme pressure and blackmail"" and said it would respond with ""strong counter-measures"".President Trump believes that if you have a trade deficit - if you import more than you export - you are losing out.He is especially irked by the hefty deficits in US trade with China and Mexico, but has indicated that he will not let any country ""take advantage of us on trade any more"".Sorry, we cannot let our friends, or enemies, take advantage of us on Trade anymore. We must put the American worker first!End of Twitter post  by @realDonaldTrumpThe US trade deficit has increased in recent years, running at around $50bn (£38bn).However, this could be the result of a stronger economy, with US consumers buying more goods from overseas. The new tariffs are meant to correct this imbalance.There were confrontational scenes and words after the recent G7 summit in Quebec, at which the other major world economies challenged Mr Trump's tariffs and trade policies. The majority of US goods targeted by the EU, such as tobacco, Harley Davidson motorcycles, cranberries and peanut butter, will now carry a tariff of 25%. However, the EU has introduced a 50% duty on goods such as footwear, some types of clothing and washing machines.Many of the products the EU has in its sights are specifically chosen to have maximum political effect. Bourbon whiskey is produced in Kentucky, the state of Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell.Orange juice is a key export for Florida, a swing state in the US elections.Meanwhile, economists have warned the US tariffs could lead to higher metal costs, disrupt supply chains and even get passed on to US households. It's difficult to tell.US trade officials have said they deliberately targeted a list of imports that will not raise prices for consumers. But retailers and producers do not agree.Rick Helfenbein, president and chief executive officer of the American Apparel & Footwear Association, says the average family of four in the US will pay at least an extra $500 a year to buy consumer products affected by the tariffs.In some cases, the tariffs may simply compel firms to seek supplies from other countries rather than pay the extra cost. If, for instance, Florida orange juice goes up in price in Europe because of the EU counter-tariffs, then firms can always import Brazilian orange juice instead.For the US, that would be an unintended consequence of the tit-for-tat spat. But it's a good example of how trade wars can take unexpected turns."
2018-06-21,Hammond: Treasury not the 'enemy of Brexit',https://web.archive.org//web/20180622101246/https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44568125,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe Treasury is not ""the enemy of Brexit"", Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond has insisted.In a speech in the City of London, Mr Hammond said the UK needed to protect patterns of trade with the EU that had been ""built over decades"".The chancellor also used his Mansion House speech to confirm taxes will have to go up to boost spending on the NHS.But he said the increase would be partly funded by lower contributions to Brussels post-Brexit. In the past the chancellor has come under fire from supporters of Brexit.Earlier this month Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson called the Treasury ""the heart of Remain"", in comments to a private dinner. However, addressing a City audience on Thursday, Mr Hammond said the ""immediate key"" to the UK and London's economic success was ""ensuring we get a good Brexit deal"".He said the goal was a partnership that ""recognises that our European neighbours are our most important trading partners, and that Dover to Calais is the busiest trading corridor in Europe"".As the UK leaves the EU, he said the new relationship should ""maintain low friction borders and open markets"".He went on: ""That does not make the Treasury, on my watch, 'the enemy of Brexit'; rather, it makes it the champion of prosperity for the British people outside the EU, but working and trading closely with it.""Mr Hammond also said the £20bn five-year NHS funding package announced by the prime minister this week would be partly funded by lower contributions to Brussels.However, he also said the government would stick to its fiscal rules and ""continue to reduce debt"".As a result taxpayers will have to ""contribute a bit more"", he added.Earlier this week, Prime Minister Theresa May announced a boost in NHS spending, which will see NHS England's budget increase by £20bn by 2023.The plan also means more money will be given to the rest of the UK - about £4bn - although it will be up to the Welsh and Scottish governments to decide how that is spent.Mr Hammond said the NHS was the government's ""number one priority for the forthcoming spending review"".""So, as the Prime Minister said, taxpayers will have to contribute a bit more, in a fair and balanced way, to support the NHS that we all use.""

2018-06-21,"Probation system 'a mess', say MPs",https://web.archive.org//web/20180622101246/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-44568810,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe system for supervising criminals in England and Wales is in a ""mess"" after reforms failed to meet their aims, MPs have said.The Commons justice committee said it was ""unconvinced"" reforms could ever deliver an effective probation service.In 2014 the system was partially privatised and monitoring extended to those who had served short jail terms.The government said there had been ""challenges"" and it is due to publish the results of a review next month. BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said one option under consideration was to terminate the contracts of the rehabilitation companies in 2020, two years early.The arrangements for managing offenders were overhauled in 2014, with the probation service split in two.A new state body, the National Probation Service (NPS), was set up to supervise high-risk offenders, with 21 Community Rehabilitation Companies (CRCs) supervising low and medium-risk offenders.The ""Transforming Rehabilitation"" project, introduced by Chris Grayling when he was justice secretary, aimed to reduce reoffending rates.But the Justice Select Committee said that programme had left the system in a ""mess"", with staff morale at an ""all-time low"" and support for prisoners leaving jail ""wholly inadequate"".It said that splitting the management of offenders between a national body and 21 rehabilitation companies created a two-tier system, which has left the voluntary sector less involved than before.The MPs said the companies' performance in reducing re-offending is ""disappointing"", with some staff dealing with cases for which they have not been properly trained.Conservative MP and justice committee chairman Bob Neill said: ""The TR reforms had some laudable aims but these reforms have failed to meet them. We are unconvinced that TR will ever deliver the kind of probation service we need.""There are ""major questions"" to be answered on a range of issues, he said, including support given to offenders, the performance of probation providers, CRC contracts, poor staff morale and the voluntary sector's involvement.Mr Neill said: ""This has a negative impact on the number of individuals who go on to reoffend. Hardworking and dedicated staff are doing their best with a probation system that is currently a mess.""The MPs urged the Ministry of Justice to review the long-term future and sustainability of delivering the service, publishing findings by February.Prisons and probation minister Rory Stewart said it was a ""significant programme of reform"".""For instance, an additional 40,000 people who would not previously have been monitored now receive support and supervision upon release,"" he said.""Fewer people are re-offending and there have been some innovative and impressive programmes.""However, we accept that there have been challenges and it is clear that CRC services do need to improve.""We are currently in commercial discussions with providers and will consider all possible options to ensure we deliver this improvement."""
2018-06-21,Minister quits to oppose Heathrow plan,https://web.archive.org//web/20180622101246/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44561170,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowJunior trade minister Greg Hands has resigned from the government to oppose expansion of Heathrow Airport.The vote on whether to build a third runway at the airport west of London is due to be held on Monday.Mr Hands, who represents the Chelsea and Fulham constituency in London, said he had pledged to oppose the new runway at the 2017 election.It had been thought that ministers with constituencies directly affected could have been allowed to miss the vote.As the Government will be whipping the vote on Monday, this means I am resigning from the Government. It has been an honour to serve the Prime Minister (and her predecessor) for the last 7 years and I wish the PM & the Government every continuing success. https://t.co/GQedGcfy80End of Twitter post  by @GregHandsThe highest profile opponent of Heathrow expansion in the cabinet is Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, who once pledged to lie down in front of bulldozers to stop it happening.But Mr Johnson is scheduled to be out of the UK on Monday so will not be attending the vote in the House of Commons.Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson suggested on Twitter that Mr Hands' resignation should prompt the prime minister to allow her MPs a free vote: ""It's not too late for her to change whipping arrangements. This would also allow Boris Johnson to re-enter the country.""Green Party co-leader Caroline Lucas said the foreign secretary should quit too: If Boris Johnson has a backbone, or a shred of credibility left, he will join Greg Hands in resigning. #Heathrow https://t.co/zcOUInt2fEEnd of Twitter post  by @CarolineLucasPrime Minister Theresa May defended the foreign secretary's absence from a vote seen by some as crucial to the UK's post-Brexit international trade campaign, known as Global Britain. She said: ""The government is absolutely committed to increasing airport capacity at Heathrow. This is important, it is part of our future as Global Britain, and the ambitions we have as a trading nation for the future.""The foreign secretary early next week will be what I would describe as the living embodiment of Global Britain. ""He will be out there actually showing the UK's continued presence around the world, and the work that the UK continues to do around the world, with our diplomacy working on so many of the issues and challenges that we face across the world today.""Labour is also divided on the controversial issue, with members of the party's leadership, such as shadow chancellor John McDonnell, opposed to it, but high profile trade union backers in favour. The party's MPs are being allowed to vote however they want to on the issue.The SNP are in favour of Heathrow expansion, with the Lib Dems opposed and with the government deciding to whip (order) Conservative MPs to vote in favour, it is widely expected that the expansion plan will get Commons backing. A Downing Street spokesman said Mr Hands, who has held various ministerial roles and was chief secretary to the Treasury under David Cameron, had ""served the government with great ability and distinction over several years, and we thank him for all of his work"".Mr Hands will be replaced as a minister in the Department for International Trade by George Hollingbery, MP for Meon Valley. Meanwhile Mr Hands has tweeted that he cannot answer media calls about his resignation - because he is visiting a Romanian monastery:Am flattered by all the media calls about my resignation today, but it’s a bit awkward as am on pilgrimage at the Romanian monastery of Voronet. With the phone ringing/vibrating constantly I think the monks think I might be a drug dealer. In short: no media interviews. pic.twitter.com/2P2HxN0StaEnd of Twitter post 2 by @GregHandsThe debate on expanding Heathrow has been going on for nearly 20 years. The last Labour government backed the idea, and won a vote on it in 2009, but that plan was scrapped - and the idea of expansion put on hold for five years - by the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition formed after the 2010 election. But the idea of expansion was resurrected and has been subsequently backed by the Conservatives. Ministers approved a draft national airports policy statement in October but Parliament has  to give its approval for detailed planning to begin. Campaigners argue that a new runway will breach the UK's legal limits on air pollution and increase noise pollution with an extra 700 planes a day. It will result in huge disruption to residents of nearby villages, such as Longford, Harmondsworth and Sipson, with hundreds of homes likely to be knocked down. Robert Barnstone, from the No 3rd Runway Coalition, told the BBC the government was ""failing people and failing the environment as well"". Former Transport Secretary Justine Greening, who backs expanding Gatwick instead, suggested the idea of Heathrow as a national hub airport was outdated and the focus should be on improving regional capacity.And Tory MP Zac Goldsmith, who resigned his Richmond Park seat in 2016 over the issue and subsequently lost a by-election, said for many people ""this doesn't just look like a blank cheque being given by this government to a foreign-owned multinational, it looks like a whole book of cheques signed by our constituents"".Heathrow's owners, which include Spanish infrastructure firm Ferrovial, say the airport is virtually full and a new runway would increase its capacity from 85.5 million to 130 million passengers. The expansion is estimated to create about 60,000 new jobs and generate about £70bn in total economic benefits by the 2050s. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling has said it will provide a ""vital legacy"" for the British economy.Residents whose houses are knocked down will get compensation worth 125% of their value - as well as legal fees and stamp duty costs paid for - while £700m would be available to fund noise insulation measures for those who decide to stay.Mr Grayling has said a ban on night flights was an ""absolute requirement"" and non-negotiable while he said landing charges paid by airlines must stay at current levels.""This runway cannot be built if it does not meet air quality rules,"" he added.Sir Howard Davies, whose 2015 review recommended a new runway as long as environmental and community impacts were addressed, said ""significant"" concessions had been made on reducing early morning flights and minimising the impact on residents on the proposed flight path."

Maybe both sides did, a bit.Lots will be said and written in the next 24 hours about who really backed down after another day of shenanigans in Parliament - whips cornering potential rebels, even today, the grim sight of a Labour MP being forced to come to vote while visibly ill in a wheelchair and on morphine, the Tories so nervous about the vote that they suspended the normal rules that allow for ill MPs to stay out of the Chamber.As Westminster games go, it is getting pretty extreme. But ultimately, your view on whether the compromise had a winner, may depend on the side you are on.Both sides of course will claim they were the victor, the haggling over a deal took so long because both sides wanted to save face.The cabinet minister Liam Fox has just told us that nothing has really changed, it was just ""procedural"" and the fundamentals were exactly the same.In contrast, one of the organisers of the rebel group, Stephen Hammond, tweeted that the government has now conceded that Parliament would have a ""real say with no constraints"", if the final Brexit deal is rejected.The two sides will, guess what, continue to argue it for weeks to come, and every insult, every rankle, every cross word on this episode, being remembered in the difficult months to come.Here are two things however that are hard to dispute.The government was worried enough about losing today to budge, even if they only gave an inch.It might be a concession that only really parliamentary lawyers understand, but the PM had to move, again, despite not wanting to.And despite the fact that she did compromise even in a meaningless way (yes I can't believe that I did just write that sentence, but it is relevant), the vote was still relatively close, certainly not comfortable enough for the government to relax any time soon. What's also the case is that the Tory rebels, or potential rebels more like, weren't willing to take dramatic action in enough number to humiliate the PM.The vote result suggests that they have the hypothetical numbers, but their critics, and their internal opponents in the Tory party would question if they really have the guts.The former boss of the Treasury, Nick McPherson, no fan of Brexit it's important to say, has just acidly written online: ""Axiom of the last 30 years. Europhile Tories always compromise to preserve party unity, Their opponents don't. #thatswhywearewhereweare""But the last 24 hours has also been frustrating for Brexiteers.Many of them believe that Theresa May didn't have to push it this far, that she could have faced down the potential rebels without having to give any ground.There are many behind the scenes urging Number 10 to take a firmer line, to dare them to vote against her.Not the Parliamentary arithmetic, but the Tories' own arithmetic, makes them believe that she'd be easily able to do so, to end it once and for all and make plain that Brexiteers are the dominant force.But to face down the rebels who want to maintain closer ties to the EU or the Brexiteers would require the prime minister to risk something that she wants to avoid - to make the splits in Tory party more exposed, to make one side of the party the overt winner. For many months she has survived by tacking first an inch one way, and then the other.Today's events with a non-compromise-compromise suggest she is simply not ready to abandon that approach.But with so many more difficult decisions to come in the next few months, on both sides, Tories are more and more frustrated that she refuses to choose.One observes that Number 10 might believe the ""lesson of Maastricht"", is to try everything to keep the Tory party together, but the truth they suggest is that the real lesson of Maastricht is that any war is only over when one side is the clear victor.The trouble is, another source suggested, she never wants to say no to anyone, but when it comes to doing this deal, she simply can't say yes to everyone."
2018-06-21,Will there be a 'Brexit dividend'?,https://web.archive.org//web/20180622101246/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44523513,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe claim: Extra funding for the NHS, up to 2023, will be part-funded by a Brexit dividend.Reality Check verdict: Once the UK stops paying into the EU budget, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) says there will be savings. But this doesn't take into account the extra spending associated with leaving the EU and the potential economic impact, as forecast by the OBR.The debate over how to fund the NHS dominated the main exchanges during Wednesday's Prime Minister's Questions, with the subject of the ""Brexit dividend"" being brought up.The government says a combination of tax rises, economic growth and a ""Brexit dividend"" will help cover the costs of the increased spending in England's NHS budget.Under the plans, the NHS annual budget will increase by £20.5bn by 2023. On top of that, about £4bn will be given to the rest of the UK - although it will be up to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to decide how that is spent.So is the UK government right to claim that we can expect a ""dividend"" by leaving the European Union? When the government talks about a ""dividend"", it is referring to the annual contribution that we pay towards the European Union budget every year.According to the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) - the independent body that scrutinises the public finances - the UK contributed just under £9bn net to the EU budget in 2016-17.Under the government's current plans, the UK will remain a member of the EU until 29 March 2019 and it will continue to pay into the EU budget until then.After that there is a proposed transition period in order to give more time to negotiate a post-Brexit relationship with the EU. The transition is scheduled to last until the end of December 2020.The amount we pay during the transition period is expected to be similar to last year's net contribution.The OBR has set out what the potential savings might be. It believes the UK will start saving money from 2020, £3bn initially and rising to £5.8bn a year in 2022-23.That's based on how much we would have contributed to the EU budget, less the financial settlement or ""divorce"" bill.But it's not as simple as that.For one, while the OBR will have made some working assumptions about size of the ""divorce"" settlement, we still don't know what the final bill will be. The latest UK estimate for the total is cost is between £35bn and £39bn. This is based on calculations the UK and EU have agreed, not the final amount on which the two sides have settled.  In April the National Audit Office said that the final bill remains uncertain and much of it depends on future events. For some parts, like pensions, the UK would end up paying for decades.But the government has already committed to pay for certain things associated with the cost of leaving the EU.Last autumn the Chancellor Philip Hammond announced £3bn of funding over the next two years to help government departments prepare for Brexit.Furthermore, a significant amount of the money the UK currently contributes to the EU ends up coming back to the UK to fund things like agricultural subsidies and science and research funding.The government has said it will preserve the funding that farmers currently receive from the EU - at least until 2022. In 2017, that was worth just over £3bn.The UK also has to decide, among other things, if it will replace EU programmes that fund development in poor UK regions as well as research and development grants.On top of all this, there's also considerable uncertainty about how the economy will perform after Brexit. According to the OBR, the saving we get from no longer paying into the EU budget will be outweighed if the economy underperforms.It says that the impact of Brexit on the public finances will be largely determined by what happens to future tax revenues, which are linked to the strength of the economy.And the OBR is already forecasting extra borrowing of about £15bn a year because the UK voted to leave the EU from 2018-19 to 2020-21.It puts this down to things like lower immigration, lower productivity and higher inflation.The government has been disputing whether the economy will take a hit. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Monday: ""A lot of the forecasts have been wrong and in fact the British economy has been... a lot more resilient than many people were forecasting."" But he did not dispute that the economy has been slowing. Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questionsFollow us on Twitter"
2018-06-21,Week ahead,https://web.archive.org//web/20180622101246/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-parliaments-44495167,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowIt's back to Brexit again in both Houses of Parliament, after the issue of a ""meaningful vote"" unexpectedly detonated. Soft Brexit/Remainer Tory MPs, led by the former attorney general Dominic Grieve, thought they had a deal with the prime minister on the issue. They had drawn back from rebelling on Tuesday on the promise of a compromise - but then discovered that the government was not offering them what they thought had been conceded.Essentially the issue is about what happens if the divorce talks with the EU run out of time, or fail to deliver a deal, or if MPs reject the proposed deal. Here comes the science bit - concentrate!On Tuesday, MPs were presented with a Lords amendment that would have given the power to MPs to direct the government's next steps in those contingencies. The government offered a replacement amendment in the Commons (an ""amendment in lieu"" in parliamentary jargon) which gave MPs a vote on the final deal, but, crucially, did not give them the opportunity to direct the government's future strategy - what they would get instead would be a statement within 28 days, setting out how the government ""proposes to proceed in relation to negotiations for the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the EU"".Dominic Grieve responded with his own amendment, which was similar to the Lords proposal, but put stronger conditions on MPs being given the power to direct the government. He set out three options which would only kick in three particular scenarios: Having pulled back from rebellion he was expecting the government to concede most of these powers, but it was not to be - and now his Lords ally Lord Hailsham (the former cabinet minister Douglass Hogg) is to put forward his proposals in the Lords, with the aim of replacing the amendment the government won in the Commons, and kicking it back to MPs. The point is that Mr Grieve and his allies would then have a chance to press it to a vote - and quite possibly win.  Both Houses have to agree on the final form of legislation before it can become law, and this intricate process - ""ping pong"" in Westminster-speak - is how MPs and peers reach an agreed wording. So on Monday we will have the Lords votes on the changes made by the Commons. Peers will probably accept most of them, but the Hailsham amendment looks set fair to be accepted (the previous version was passed by a majority of 91 votes) and it will then be kicked back to the Commons, for consideration on Wednesday.Will it win there? The government has a narrow majority with its DUP allies, but if the group around Mr Grieve vote with Labour and the other opposition parties, they would have a majority. Unless some Labour MPs broke ranks and voted with the government, or abstained. And there is a contingent of pro Brexit MPs and MPs from strongly Leave constituencies who may well do so. The arithmetic looks very tight, and the rival sets of party whips will doubtless be working very hard to minimise the number of rebels on their side. It's worth remembering that the Grieve group, unlike the Brexiteers, are not bloodied in rebellion from years of backbench insurgency - so it will be interesting to see if the iron has entered their souls, or whether they can be persuaded to relent. In the end it might even come down to MPs being taken ill or stuck on a train - but unless a new compromise is struck over the weekend, and the implication of bad faith around the previous deal may make that hard to do - we could be in for a week of drama which could prove highly destabilising to the government.Something else to watch out for is an effort to secure an Estimates Day debate on the Defence Budget; debates on these days are under a procedure which allows detailed discussion of money issues, and both the Defence Select Committee and the Public Accounts Committee are extremely concerned about the state of the Ministry of Defence finances. As luck would have it, members of both were recently together at Rossyth, for a visit to the new aircraft carrier, HMS Queen Elizabeth II, and the rumour is that a coordinated move to get the issue onto the floor of the Commons has been cooked up. Here's my rundown of the week ahead:The Commons opens (2.30 pm) with Housing, Communities and Local Government questions - and any statements or urgent questions will follow at 3.30 pm. Then comes the Emergency Debate secured by the SNP leader, Ian Blackford, on the Sewel Convention - the convention that Westminster seeks ""legislative consent"" for new laws touching on the devolved governments of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.  This follows the passage of amendments to the EU (Withdrawal) Bill on which EU powers will and will not be passed to the devolved parliaments, which were opposed by the Scottish Parliament. After  last week's furious scenes, this could provide another flashpoint between the SNP and, in particular, the Scottish Tory MPs and the government whips - the whips have developed a habit of standing close to the SNP benches and heckling their MPs, which is much resented. MPs then deal with Lords amendments to the Automated and Electric Vehicles Bill - in what should be a pretty brief encounter, before moving on to votes on a statutory instrument on the Draft European Union (Definition of Treaties) (Canada Trade Agreement) Order and European Documents relating to EU Trade Agreements: EU-Japan Economic Partnership Agreement. And after that there is a general debate on how the NHS and other public services deal with acquired brain injuries.In Westminster Hall (4.30 pm) MPs debate e-petition 209433: ""Give the electorate a referendum on the abolition of the House of Lords - the House of Lords is a place of patronage where unelected and unaccountable individuals hold a disproportionate amount of influence and power which can be used to frustrate the elected representatives of the people."" The petition attracted 168,755 signatures.My committee pick is the Transport Committee hearing (4.45pm) on Rail timetable changes - when MPs will question top executives from GTR, Arriva Rail North, London North Western and Network Rail. It was announced on Friday that Charles Horton is to resign as chief executive of Govia Thameslink Railway, following months of controversy over delays and cancellations to services. Bring popcorn. In the Lords, after a half hour question time at 2.30pm, peers embark on their consideration of Commons amendments to the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill  (see above).MPs kick off (at 11.30 am) with Health and Social Care questions, after which the Conservative Craig Mackinlay presents a Ten Minute Rule Bill to give Gibraltar an MP (this had been due to be debated some months ago, and was rescheduled). Then comes a Labour Opposition Day Debate on a motion (or motions) to be announced.In Westminster Hall, the opening debate (9.30am) is on Romania: the member state which will hold the EU Presidency next year, and therefore has a crucial brokering role in the final Brexit negotiations. The debate will be opened by the Conservative, Bob Blackman, who believes Romania is very keen to help, and will want to extend bilateral arrangements with the UK, post Brexit. He also wants to discuss Romanian concerns about Russian activity in the Black Sea.Labour's Helen Goodman (2.30pm) leads a debate on geothermal energy, which she says has a huge potential to provide a carbon free energy source - including in former coal communities, where decommissioned mine shafts can be used. But, she says, it does not feature in the government's energy strategy. Her aim in this debate is to raise the profile and press ministers to take the opportunities seriously.My committee corridor pick is the International Development hearing (10am) on the humanitarian situation in Gaza, with witnesses from the UN, followed by the Foreign Office and International Development and minister, Alistair Burt.In the Lords (2.30pm) peers debate the detail of the Rating (Property in Common Occupation) and Council Tax (Empty Dwellings) Bill - the measure that will allow local councils to increase the tax on empty homes. Then there is a short debate on encouraging a recovery in the population of bees and other pollinators.The Commons begins (11.30am) with half an hour of Northern Ireland questions, before moving on to the high noon of Prime Minister's Question time.The day's Ten Minute Rule Bill, from the SNP's Martin Docherty-Hughes aims to create an Armed Forces Representative Body. Time has then been set aside to consider Lords amendments to the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill (see above) and there will be a general debate on Nato.One thing to keep an eye on is a possible statement from a health minister on the findings of Bishop James Jones' independent inquiry into deaths at the Gosport Memorial Hospital. The inquiry was commissioned during the coalition years, following concerns about the over-use of morphine on patients. Look out for Lib Dem former health minister Norman Lamb...In Westminster Hall, there are debates on the UN report on the convention on the rights of persons with disabilities (9.30am-11am);  the UK constitutional machinery and the frameworks for intergovernmental cooperation (2.30pm-4pm); UK and Polish war reparations against Germany (4pm-4.30pm) and insecure work and the gig economy (4.30pm-5.30pm). On the committee corridor, the Housing, Communities and Local Government Committee (9.30am) takes evidence one year on, on local authority support for Grenfell Tower survivors - there are witnesses from Grenfell United, the North Kensington Law Centre, Councillor Elizabeth Campbell, the Leader of Kensington and Chelsea Council, and Nick Hurd, the minister of state for Policing and Fire Service, with responsibility for Grenfell Tower victims work, at the Home Office. And meanwhile, there's a lively session in prospect, when arch europhile MEP Guy ""the Hoff"" Verhofstadt, the coordinator and chair of the European Parliament Brexit Steering Group, gives evidence to the Brexit Committee on the progress of the UK's negotiations on EU withdrawal (9.15 am) - and he turns up again in the afternoon, before the Home Affairs Committee (2.30pm) to talk about Post-Brexit migration policy. The European Parliament has to sign off on the EU side of Britain's divorce deal, so his views will matter.In the Lords (3pm), the main event is the second reading of the Courts and Tribunals (Judiciary and Functions of Staff) Bill, which seeks to remove restrictions on how judges can be deployed, so they can hear a wider range of cases. The Commons opens (9.30am) with Digital, Culture, Media and Sport questions, followed by questions to the Attorney General (10.10am) and the weekly Business Questions to the Leader of the House. The main debates are on backbench motions on the importance of refugee family reunion - the SNP's Angus Brendan MacNeil proposes a motion welcoming the fact that the Refugees (Family Reunion) (No.2) Bill was given its second reading without opposition on 16 March 2018, and calling on the government to support the bill.Then Labour MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle has a motion on the future of the Erasmus+ student exchange scheme, after 2020, calling on the government to ensure continued UK access, after Brexit.In the Lords (11am) question time marks national Yoga Day with a query on the benefits of yoga for obese school children. Peers then debate the support available to carers and the Carers Action Plan 2018 - 2020; and the implications for the UKs future trade relations following the failure to reach agreement at the G7 Summit in Canada. And then they discuss the contribution of the armed forces reserves to national security. Neither House sits on Friday 22 June."

But in the process he's angered anti-war activists and critics of British and Western foreign policy, who claim he's been biased against them. ""Christmas Day, Eid day, Easter Day, Cup final day, early hours of the morning, in the middle of the night - this man is on my case,"" says George Galloway, the former Labour and Respect Party MP. ""And it doesn't take an Einstein to work out he's not tending this garden with loving care or to make it look as nice as it can look. It's the opposite."" The subject of Galloway's ire is a prolific Wikipedia editor who goes by the name ""Philip Cross"". He's been the subject of a huge debate on the internet encyclopaedia - one of the world's most popular websites - and also on Twitter. And he's been accused of bias for interacting, sometimes negatively, with some of the people whose Wikipedia pages he's edited. The Philip Cross account was created at precisely 18:48 GMT on 26 October 2004. Since then, he's made more than 130,000 edits to more 30,000 pages. That's a substantial amount, but not hugely unusual - it's not enough edits, for example, to put him in the top 300 editors on Wikipedia. But it's what he edits which has preoccupied anti-war politicians and journalists. In his top 10 most-edited pages are the jazz musician Duke Ellington, The Sun newspaper, and Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre. But also in that top 10 are a number of vocal critics of American and British foreign policy: the journalist John Pilger, Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn and Corbyn's director of strategy, Seamus Milne.His critics also say that Philip Cross has made favourable edits to pages about public figures who are supportive of Western military intervention in the Middle East. He's recently caught the attention of bloggers and has been the subject of stories in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz and Russian state-owned outlets Sputnik and RT. There have been allegations on social media - all unproven - that he's a government agent, employed by rich and powerful media interests, or is a mainstream journalist with an obsessive hobby.You may also be interested in:""His edits are remorselessly targeted at people who oppose the Iraq war, who've opposed the subsequent intervention wars … in Libya and Syria, and people who criticise Israel,"" Galloway says. Recently Galloway offered a reward of £1000 to anyone who could provide information to reveal the editor's identity.The former MP says he's received information about Philip Cross and that the reward has already been claimed, but that he is not revealing the personal details of the person behind the account.When it comes to Galloway's page, the Philip Cross account is responsible for 20.4% of all edits.But it's difficult to get an overall sense of whether those changes were solely motivated by any particular political bias on behalf of the person behind the account.  More on this storyFor example, a sentence where Galloway criticised the Labour Party as ""Tony Blair's lie machine"" was removed, with Cross citing ""partial repetition, poor source"". In another case, Cross removed links to lurid tabloid headlines about Galloway's private life. In addition, many of the edits were simply grammatical or stylistic.  At one point Cross noted: ""It helps the article if each sentence or paragraph does not begin with 'Galloway' or 'He'.""Wikipedia, which was launched in 2001, relies on volunteers to write and edit entries. Wikipedians have developed an enormous set of rules and procedures guiding the development of a site which now has more than 5.5m articles in English.In addition to his Wikipedia edits, Philip Cross has a Twitter account which he has used to interact with Galloway and other politicians and journalists. In one tweet, for instance, he called a group of anti-war activists ""goons"". That raised claims of a conflict of interest, which is potentially against Wikipedia guidelines. The account is currently subject to a review process run by Wikipedia volunteers, although Philip Cross has promised to stop editing Galloway's entry for an ""indeterminate length of time regardless of any decision"".The Wikimedia Foundation - which established and funds Wikipedia - declined an interview request, but said in a statement:""Independent volunteer editors consistently monitor Wikipedia, often aided by technology, to ensure its articles remain neutral and well-sourced for the hundreds of millions of people who rely on it every month. ""If repeat violations to Wikipedia policies do occur, volunteers have a variety of mechanisms to draw from, including issuing warnings and blockings, to address content and behaviour that does not meet Wikipedia standards."" On Twitter, Wikipedia's co-founder, Jimmy Wales, rejected claims that Philip Cross is making entries biased.Of course there's only one person who could definitively lay to rest questions about the origins of the account - and that is Philip Cross himself.BBC Trending has been able to establish that he lives in England, and that Philip Cross is not the name he normally goes by outside of Wikipedia.

2018-06-21,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20180622101246/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-44470777,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe claim: The UK's 20-year devolution convention has been ""ripped up"".Reality Check verdict: The convention has been undermined but there is no legal reason why the UK government cannot ignore the Scottish Parliament over Brexit. Scotland's first minister says the passage of the UK's key Brexit legislation without the consent of the Scottish Parliament has ""ripped up the 20-year-old devolution convention"" in the UK. Is she right?Ms Sturgeon's tweet came after the House of Commons spent less than 20 minutes debating the EU Withdrawal Bill's impact on devolution. The SNP said that showed ""contempt for Scottish democracy"", with the party's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, leading a walk-out of his MPs during Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday.The row centres on a so-called ""power grab"", with the Scottish government accusing Westminster of keeping some powers for itself that should go to the Scottish Parliament at Holyrood, after Brexit.  The UK government says the ""temporary"" move will allow the same rules and regulations to remain in place across the whole of the UK in 24 key areas, such as agriculture, fisheries and food labelling.And it points out that the vast majority of the 153 areas where policy in devolved areas is currently decided in Brussels will go directly to the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly, meaning both will have considerably more powers after Brexit than they do now. Months of talks have failed to reach a deal - although the Welsh government dropped its opposition after changes were made that would put a limit on how long the UK government would keep the powers.Last month, the Scottish Parliament voted overwhelmingly to refuse consent for the Brexit bill, with the SNP being joined by Labour, the Greens and Liberal Democrat MSPs and only the Conservatives voting against. The UK government pressed on regardless - so how was it able to do so? When the devolved Scottish Parliament was set up in 1999, it was handed control over many policy areas such as health and education that had previously been decided at Westminster.However, an agreement signed by the two governments in 2001 stated that ""the United Kingdom Parliament retains authority to legislate on any issue, whether devolved or not"" and that it was ""ultimately for parliament to decide what use to make of that power"". It also stated that the UK government ""will proceed in accordance with the convention that the UK Parliament would not normally legislate with regard to devolved matters except with the agreement of the devolved legislature"". This agreement was inserted into the Scotland Act in 2016, which was drawn up after the independence referendum two years earlier.The word ""normally"" is, of course, an important caveat that is open to different interpretations - is Brexit ""normal"", for example?Scottish Secretary David Mundell said these were not normal times and a failure to proceed with the bill would jeopardise businesses across the UK.He accused the Scottish government of wanting a veto over arrangements that would apply to the whole of the UK and insisted the UK government ""followed the spirit and letter of the devolution settlement at every stage"" despite the failure to secure consent.  Consent is sought through something known as the Sewel Convention, named after former Labour government minister Lord Sewel, which, in effect, allowed the UK government to ask MSPs for permission to change the law in an area that is devolved to Holyrood. Similar conventions apply in both Wales and Northern Ireland. Until Brexit came along, the Scottish Parliament had only once before refused to give its consent - over some aspects of the Welfare Reform Bill in 2011, which resulted in the Scottish government introducing its own legislation to resolve the row. So Ms Sturgeon is correct to say that pushing through the EU Withdrawal Bill without the consent of the Scottish Parliament means that the long-standing convention has, in effect, been ""ripped up"".However, as its name suggests, it is merely a convention and there is no legal requirement for the UK government to seek Holyrood's permission - or to respect its decision if it says ""no"". This was confirmed by the Supreme Court last year, when it ruled on the case brought by Gina Miller about the triggering of Article 50, which started the Brexit process. Judges ruled that the Sewel Convention was not a legally enforceable rule despite being inserted into the Scotland Act.This meant that the Scottish Parliament did not have a veto over Article 50 or, by extension, the EU Withdrawal Bill. Regardless, ignoring the result of the Scottish Parliament vote was sure to provoke fury from the SNP, with Ms Sturgeon warning that ""the decision to act without our consent, and the manner of doing it, will not be forgotten"".Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questionsFollow us on Twitter"
2018-06-21,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20180622101246/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks  are now focusing on the detail of those issues and on future relations - after agreement was reached on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree within six months on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide, but first let's go back to the basics...It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.1% in the first three months of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.4%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand near a 40-year year low of 4.2%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 4.2% in the year to March 2018, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues. The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May was now put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. It will end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain-supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each playing roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanAn agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pounds buy fewer euros. A slump in the value of the dollar means the exchange rate with the pound is pretty close to where it was before the referendum.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.The UK has proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.A method for calculating the bill has been agreed, but the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more.The question of how and when payments will be made still needs to resolved, but it will be a schedule lasting for many years to come, and it is highly unlikely that anyone will ever be able to give an exact figure for the size of the divorce bill.UK sources say it will be up to £40bn, but some EU sources expect it to be higher than that. No-one can say for sure, and both sides want to keep it that way.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 6.5% in 2016 to 2.7% in 2017, according to the Halifax. It said the slowdown was driven by a squeeze on real wage growth.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-06-21,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180622101246/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to £840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

As I write, Mrs May is holed up with her advisers inside Tory HQ. But a former minister Anna Soubry has called for her to ""consider her position"" - political code for calling for her to resign.

On the two previous occasions in 1970 and February 1974 the PM and the party lost office. While there is no other conceivable administration in the new parliament other than a Conservative-led one, it remains to be seen whether the PM will retain her position. However, so long as the Conservatives can reach an accommodation with the DUP they will have a working majority in the House of Commons.  BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed:When the general election exit poll was revealed at 10pm, the pound immediately dropped by 2% as investors took a position that a hung parliament was a possible outcome of the general election.Why would that cause the currency to decline?

Michael Russell said the Scottish government no longer trusted UK ministers after they pushed through the Brexit bill last week.He was speaking as Nicola Sturgeon arrived in Guernsey for talks with UK Cabinet Minister David Lidington.Mr Lidington said governments should ""co-operate on the big issues"".He insisted the UK government was committed to maintaining a good working relationship with the devolved administrations despite the ""inevitable political noise"" over Brexit.And he urged the Scottish government ""to maintain their own side of that relationship"".Relations between the two governments are said to be at their lowest ever level after the Commons last week spent less than 20 minutes debating the EU Withdrawal Bill's impact on devolution, despite the Scottish Parliament voting to withhold consent. Ms Sturgeon has accused the UK government of ""ripping up"" the devolution settlement.The first minister also said she was ""proud"" of SNP MPs who walked out of Prime Minister's Questions in protest over the UK government's handling of the bill - a move that was derided as a ""pre-arranged stunt"" by opponents. Senior SNP and Scottish government figures have said the protest was not a one-off, and it would not be ""business as usual"" for devolution.Speaking to the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme, Mr Russell said he ""couldn't conceive of circumstances"" where MSPs would vote to give approval for further UK legislation related to leaving the EU, such as trade, agriculture and fisheries.He added: ""We are absolutely clear that the way that devolution operates and the structures of devolution have failed, and they failed because the UK government is refusing to operate them.""For example, on the Sewel Convention, we need to have the interpretation of that written down in statute and made legally binding, because what we've presently got is a situation where the UK government makes the rules and then breaks them themselves, and there are no sanctions.""He said that, while there was ""practical work"" to do to prepare for Brexit, ""it is very difficult to do that work because, frankly, we don't trust the UK government with it"".Ms Sturgeon and Mr Lidington are at a meeting of the British-Irish Council in Guernsey, which is also being attended by Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones and representatives from Guernsey, Jersey and the Isle of Man.Ahead of the meeting, Ms Sturgeon and Mr Jones issued a joint statement in which they repeated their call for the UK to remain in the single market and customs union after Brexit - which has already been ruled out by Prime Minister Theresa May. Airbus announced on Friday morning that it could leave the UK if the country exits the European Union single market and customs union without a transition deal.Mr Russell said the announcement was further evidence of the ""carnage"" in terms of jobs and the economy that Brexit could bring. The EU Withdrawal has been at the centre of a long-running row between Edinburgh and London, and has been pushed through by the UK government despite MSPs at Holyrood refusing to grant consent.It is the first time this has happened since the Scottish Parliament was created in 1999.Please upgrade your browserMr Lidington said voters expected the governments across the UK to work together and highlighted how Scotland had voted to remain part of the UK.He said: ""Working together is exactly what people all across the UK want to see their respective governments doing.""They want to see their lives being improved through joint endeavour. They don't expect different governments - with politicians from different parties - to agree on everything.""But they do expect us to keep talking - and listening - to each other, and to co-operate on the big issues that affect us all.""The UK government is committed to ""not normally"" passing laws that impact on devolved powers under something known as the Sewel Convention.But it argues that Brexit means these are not ""normal"" times, and that it needed to act despite not having Holyrood consent in order to allow a smooth transition after the UK leaves the EU.The row over the Brexit bill centres on 153 powers in what are now devolved areas, but which were sent to Brussels when the UK joined the EU in 1973. Westminster effectively wants to keep ""temporary"" control of 24 of these powers when they return to the UK after Brexit, with the remainder of the 153 going directly to the Scottish Parliament.It says having control in key areas such as farming and food labelling for the first few years after Brexit will ensure the same rules continue to be followed across the UK.The Scottish government wants all of the powers straight away - although it agrees that UK-wide rules and regulations are needed - and has repeatedly accused the UK government of a ""power grab""."
2018-06-22,Airbus warns it could exit UK,https://web.archive.org//web/20180622155414/https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44570931,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAirbus has warned it could leave the UK if the country exits the European Union single market and customs union without a transition deal.The European planemaker said the warning was not part of ""project fear"", but its ""dawning reality"".Airbus employs about 14,000 people at 25 different sites in the UK.Last week, the outgoing president of the CBI said sections of UK industry faced extinction unless the UK stayed in the EU customs union.It brings together the EU's 28 members in a duty-free area, with a common import tariff for non-EU goods.Prime Minister Theresa May has ruled out staying in the customs union. The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019.The UK government is considering two other options: a customs partnership that would remove the need for new customs checks at the border; and a ""highly streamlined"" customs arrangement that would minimise customs checks rather than getting rid of them altogether.Michel Barnier, the EU's Brexit negotiator, has said that both options are unrealistic.A spokesperson for Prime Minister Theresa May said: ""We are confident that we are going to get a good deal, one that ensures that trade is as free and frictionless as possible, including for the aerospace sector,"" A Welsh government spokesperson said the Airbus announcement was ""extremely worrying"".""We have repeatedly warned that the UK cannot take the huge economic risk of cutting ourselves adrift from the single market and customs union. Particularly in the case of manufacturing sectors, which in Wales are so important in providing high-paid, high-skilled jobs.""The BBC's business editor, Simon Jack, says the Airbus announcement reflects ""growing exasperation"" over Brexit in the UK's boardrooms.He adds that Business Secretary Greg Clark has been similarly exasperated by companies' tendency to complain to him about the issue, only to soften their tone when faced with the prime minister.""He, I think, will be delighted that a company with Airbus's footprint has gone as public as this,"" our business editor said.In its Brexit ""risk assessment"" published on Thursday, Airbus said if the UK left the EU next year without a deal - meaning it left both the single market and customs union immediately and without any agreed transition - it would ""lead to severe disruption and interruption of UK production"". ""This scenario would force Airbus to reconsider its investments in the UK, and its long-term footprint in the country,"" it added.The company, which makes wings for the A320, A330/A340, A350 and A380 passenger planes in the UK, also said the current planned transition period, due to end in December 2020, was too short for it to make changes to its supply chain. As a result, it would ""refrain from extending"" its UK supplier base. It said it currently had more than 4,000 suppliers in the UK.Tom Williams, chief operating officer of Airbus Commercial Aircraft, said in ""any scenario"", Brexit had ""severe negative consequences"" for the UK aerospace industry and Airbus in particular.Without a deal, he said Airbus believed the impact on its UK operations could be ""significant"". ""Put simply, a no-deal scenario directly threatens Airbus' future in the UK.""Mr Williams told the BBC's Today programme that Airbus was currently working on developing the ""next generation"" of aircraft wings in the UK.""We are seriously considering whether we should continue that development or whether we should find alternative solutions,"" he added.Airbus UK's senior vice-president, Katherine Bennett, said the company had ""huge concerns"" about a possible no-deal Brexit: ""We're very fearful there will be chaos at the borders and we want our factories to be able to operate as smoothly as possible.""Conservative MP Stephen Crabb said the warning from Airbus should be a ""wake-up call"".Mr Crabb tweeted: ""The enormous Airbus factory in North Wales is one of the jewels in the crown of UK manufacturing. This is a wake-up call. A pragmatic, sensible Brexit that protects trade & jobs is vital.""And shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer tweeted: ""If proof was needed that the PM's Brexit red lines need to be abandoned (and fast), this is it.""The warnings from Airbus echo comments made on Wednesday by the boss of Siemens in the UK.  Jürgen Maier said the UK should remain in the customs union after Brexit unless there was a ""proper alternative"".Last week, Paul Drechsler, the outgoing president of the CBI, said some parts of industry in the UK faced extinction if the country left the EU customs union.Paul Drechsler said car firm bosses had come to him saying the industry would suffer unless there was ""real frictionless trade"".Mr Drechsler also said there was ""zero evidence"" that trade deals outside the EU would provide any economic benefit to Britain."
2018-06-22,£2.4m spent on Commons gagging clauses,https://web.archive.org//web/20180622155414/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44571120,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe House of Commons spent £2.4m on ""gagging clauses"" for former staff since 2013, BBC Newsnight has learned.Fifty-three departing members of the House of Commons Service signed contracts compelling them not to reveal information about the Commons.So-called ""non-disclosure agreements"" (NDAs) can be used to silence victims of bullying or harassment.A House spokesman said the clauses were used ""to resolve employment disputes under certain circumstances"".Newsnight uncovered the information via a Freedom of Information Act request, which was made as part of its investigation into bullying and harassment by MPs of members of the House of Commons Service - the apolitical employees who run the Commons and its committees. These people are usually referred to in Westminster as ""clerks"".Newsnight has previously reported that Angus Sinclair, formerly the Speaker's secretary, was paid £86,000 - more than a year of pay - as part of a settlement that entailed him signing a non-disclosure agreement. He felt he was being paid off to stay quiet about being bullied by the Speaker of the House of Commons (an allegation that the Speaker denies). The answer to the request reveals that £2.4m was spent on 53 settlements including gagging clauses with departing staff members since 2013. (The Press Association has, by the same means, got the same information which they are publishing independently.) The average settlement cost £45,418.Jill Rutter of the Institute for Government, said: ""The public sector should not be allowed to waste taxpayers' money on NDAs"". She said it was ""impossible to justify as [value for money]"".These figures are a slight underestimate. There may also be some other cases in 2012 and 2018, but the numbers involved are small enough that they fear publishing them would allow people to figure out information about identifiable individuals. The House of Commons reply to Newsnight clarifies that the NDAs were ""settlement agreements (formerly known as compromise agreements) which include a confidentiality clause"". It is unclear how many of these contracts were signed, as Mr Sinclair believes was the case for him, in order to prevent information about bullying or harassment leaking out.Newsnight has established, however, that confidentiality clauses were not standard in House of Commons exit deals: the annual report for the financial year 2016-17 shows 43 people left the House on ""exit packages"", but only 23 were given NDAs in all of 2016 and 2017.  We also know that people, known to Newsnight, who had made complaints about sexual harassment or bullying at the House were asked to sign NDAs when they left with an exit deal. Some other NDAs, however, were really a means of getting rid of a staff member more easily. Getting them to sign a non-disclosure agreement could be used as a justification for a bigger pay-off. Gagging clauses are sometimes suggested by unions to get more money out of employers for a departing member of staff. So while some of these NDAs may have been intended to keep the culture under wraps, it is not clear how many that applies to. The House of Commons, however, is now likely to face questions about its use of NDAs. The House of Commons does not have trade secrets, for example, that might justify the use of gagging clauses. Maria Miller, chair of the women and equalities committee, which is researching the use of NDAs, said: ""There needs to be more transparency on why payments such as this are being made in the first place.""

The marine environment is listed as the main topic for discussion, but Brexit was also discussed ahead of next week's EU summit in Brussels.Mr Varadkar said: ""We have made some good progress to date and I think it will be possible to come to a withdrawal agreement that works for everyone.""But we also need to be prepared for the possibility that that will not happen.""All EU countries will be stepping up preparations for all possible scenarios, including a no-deal Brexit.""It is the the fourth time the summit has been held in Guernsey.Mr Varadkar held bilateral discussions with Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones.British Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington also attended.Gareth Gordon, BBC NI political correspondentThe British Irish Council was set up under the Good Friday Agreement. Its sister organisation was the North-South Ministerial Council, which was made up of ministers from the Northern Ireland Executive and ministers from the Irish government. For obvious reasons, that has not met since just before the collapse of Stormont. Once again, the Northern Ireland parties will be absent at the British Irish Council due to the collapse of Stormont.The main topic for discussion is meant to be the marine environment, but Brexit is bound to loom large, especially ahead of of next week's EU summit in Brussels. The taoiseach did not make the summit dinner last night because had business in Dublin with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker. Instead, he flew in this morning. Mr Varadkar reiterated yesterday that Ireland expects Britain to honour its commitments and have no hard border.The Irish government issued a statement last night saying Mr Varadkar's meetings with the Scottish first minister and Welsh first minister will focus on the implications of Brexit. The council will also talk about the political situation in Northern Ireland and Mr Varadkar is expected to reiterate his regret that no Northern Ireland ministers are at the British-Irish Council summit. The meeting coincides with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker's two-day visit to Ireland.On Thursday, Mr Junker said that Ireland is not alone in Brexit negotiations and will remain backed by all member states.""This is not a bilateral question between Ireland the United Kingdom - this is an issue between the UK and the European Union,"" he said.""We want to make it clear again and again that Ireland is not alone.""We have Ireland backed by 26 member states and the commission - this will not change.""I am strongly against any temptation to isolate Ireland and not to conclude the deal on Ireland.""Ireland has to be part of the deal.""On Friday, he will also meet Irish President Michael D Higgins and visit the home of the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA), Croke Park, and the GAA museum.He will also watch a demonstration of Gaelic football and hurling."
2018-06-22,Watchdog expected to find Vote Leave broke rules,https://web.archive.org//web/20180622155414/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44567588,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAn investigation into whether the official Leave campaign in the EU Referendum broke electoral rules is scheduled to be published within weeks. The draft Electoral Commission's report concludes that Vote Leave and another smaller campaign group did break the rules, the BBC understands, and is expected to recommend at least one fine.  The latest investigation comes after allegations were made by the whistleblowers Christopher Wylie and Shahmir Sanni that the official Brexit campaign broke the law by colluding with a smaller group, BeLeave. It is understood that the commission did consider this new evidence, but it is not thought that the new information was decisive in proving a breach of the law. This is the first full formal investigation into Vote Leave, although the Electoral Commission had twice examined the campaign's behaviour. One source said that the draft report was ""bizarre"" and had ""gone way off track"" by focusing on the original information that has already been pored over, rather than additional evidence. It's suggested that the commission did not interview, nor request interviews, with the senior members of the Vote Leave Campaign team. Lawyers for those criticised in the report are understood to be challenging the draft findings, and publication could therefore be subject to delay. It is not clear if the commission plans only to recommend civil sanctions like fines, or also suggest referring the matter to the police or Crown Prosecution Service. Suggestions that the official Leave campaign, which featured senior Cabinet ministers, broke the law, would be highly controversial. Vote Leave and BeLeave have both always denied the allegations. An Electoral Commission spokesperson said: ""In accordance with its Enforcement Policy, the Electoral Commission has written to Vote Leave, Mr Darren Grimes and Veterans for Britain to advise each campaigner of the outcome of the investigation announced on 20 November 2017. ""The campaigners have 28 days to make representations before final decisions are taken. ""The commission will announce the outcome of the investigation and publish an investigation report once this final decision has been taken.""  Lawyer Tamsin Allen, who acts for Mr Sanni, Mr Wylie and a third whistleblower, said ""The legal opinion and evidence submitted to the EC demonstrated the grounds for suspecting that Vote Leave and BeLeave conducted an unlawful spending scheme.  ""If the Electoral Commission has indeed found those in the scheme guilty of  electoral offences, this is vindication for the whistleblowers, but a serious blow for the public and for the integrity of the referendum vote."""
2018-06-22,UK's plan for EU citizens who want to stay,https://web.archive.org//web/20180622155414/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44553225,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowEU citizens will have to answer three ""simple"" questions online if they want to continue living in the UK after Brexit, the home secretary has said.Sajid Javid said the government's ""default"" position would be to grant, not refuse, settled status.People will be asked to prove their ID, whether they have criminal convictions and whether they live in the UK.Their answers will be checked against government databases and a decision given ""very quickly"", said Mr Javid.The scheme will operate online and via a smartphone app, Mr Javid said, and would be ""as simple as people can reasonably expect"", with most decisions turned around within two weeks or sooner.Speaking to a House of Lords committee, Mr Javid said there would have to be ""a very good reason"" why an application would be refused.The Home Office said the criminal record checks would be about ""serious and persistent criminality, not parking fines"".The £170m scheme will be compulsory for all EU citizens living in the UK - the government expects a total of 3.5 million applications.EU citizens and family members who have been in the UK for five years by the end of 2020 will be able to apply for ""settled status"", meaning they are free to go on living and working in the UK indefinitely.Those who have arrived by December 31, 2020, but do not have five years' residence, can seek to stay until they have, at which point they can seek settled status.The scheme also includes citizens of Switzerland, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.Applications will cost £65 for adults and £32.50 for children and be free for EU nationals who already have residency or indefinite leave to remain.Applicants will be asked to provide their biographical information, declare whether they have any criminal records, and upload a facial photograph.The process requires verification of the applicant's identity and nationality using a passport, ID card or other valid document, which can be done using a smartphone app or through secure post.The government hopes to start trials within a few weeks, with people allowed to start registering in the autumn.Mr Javid told the Lords EU Justice sub-committee he wanted it to be fully operational by the ""start of next year"", adding that he wanted to avoid a ""surge"" of applicants when the UK leaves the EU in March.The scheme would run for at least two years after Brexit day, probably to around June 2021, said the home secretary.The hope is that most applicants will not have to provide supporting documents because their answers will be checked against HM Revenue and Customs and other government databases.Applicants with Android phones will be able to download an app which can read the chip in their passport to verify their identity - and they will be able to take a ""selfie"" that can be checked against Home Office records, said Mr Javid.But he said there was an ""an issue at the moment"" with Apple device users, who will not be able to make use of this app, and instead will have to send in their passport to prove their identity.The home secretary said he had raised the issue with Apple on a recent visit to Silicon Valley and the company was ""looking at it actively"".Analysis by BBC Home Affairs correspondent Danny ShawWhat the Home Office is embarking on is a hugely complex project within a tight timescale.  When challenged about the potential for it go wrong, officials point to the Passport Office as an example of a service successfully processing millions of cases every year. But unlike the biometric passport system, the EU registration scheme is being built from scratch. For hundreds of thousands of EU nationals, who have a straightforward and legitimate employment history in Britain and are comfortable using digital technology, their applications may well be resolved ""within days"", the time officials rather ambitiously claim cases will take. But for claimants hoping to bring in relatives, people unfamiliar with computers and those with a more sketchy background in Britain, perhaps involving some cash-in-hand work, the process may be a hurdle they'll struggle with - or avoid altogether.“After two years of being left in limbo, we don’t take things on trust… we want legally binding guarantees” @maikebohn on ‘settled status’ and rights of EU citizens in UK after Brexit #bbcdp pic.twitter.com/iCyREHpf4iEnd of Twitter post  by @daily_politicsLabour MP Yvette Cooper, chair of the Commons home affairs committee, said ""far more"" answers were needed from the government ""about what happens to those who aren't registered by June 2021 through no fault of their own, such as children"". ""At the moment it appears that if children aren't registered within the next three years then they will lose their legal rights even though they may have been here all their lives."" SNP home affairs spokeswoman Jo Cherry, speaking in the Commons, said: ""There are potentially significant numbers of people who could fall through the cracks here. ""If just 5% of the estimated three million EU citizens living in the UK don't register by the deadline there would be a population of nearly 200,000 left without status.""Former Labour minister Hilary Benn, who chairs the Commons Brexit Committee, asked ministers if the scheme would still stand in the event of a no-deal Brexit.Immigration Minister Caroline Nokes said: ""We have confidence that there will be a deal.""Sajid Javid promised there would be no repeat of the Windrush scandal - which saw people who had lived in the UK for decades threatened with deportation because they did not have the right paperwork - for EU migrants, adding ""lessons had been learned"".The new ""settled status"" scheme would establish the right of EU migrants to remain in the UK, unlike in the case of Windrush families where there was only an assumption they had a right to stay, without any documentary proof, he told the committee.The home secretary accused EU nations, such as France and Spain, of failing to match the UK's progress on plans for expats after Brexit.There are about 900,000 UK citizens in the EU, according to ONS figures.Both sides of the Brexit negotiations have resolved to secure the status of expats by the time the UK leaves the EU in March 2019.But any deal they reach will have to be ratified by the European Parliament and agreed to by member states.If the UK leaves the EU without a deal then the status of British citizens living in the EU member states is less certain.The UK would expect member states to allow Britons living in the EU the same rights as it plans to grant EU citizens in the UK but it would be down to individual countries to decide what to do."

Producing clothes requires toxic chemicals and produces climate-changing emissions. ""Every time we put on a wash, thousands of plastic fibres wash down the drain and into the oceans. We don't know where or how to recycle end of life clothing.""Our inquiry will look at how the fashion industry can remodel itself to be both thriving and sustainable.""The committee is inviting people to comment by September on the environmental impact of the fashion industry, waste, unwanted clothing and working conditions in UK garment factories.Among the questions it will ask is whether fast fashion is unsustainable, and what can be done to encourage people to buy fewer clothes and think more about how they are disposed of."
2018-06-22,Service celebrates Windrush anniversary,https://web.archive.org//web/20180622155414/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-44571616,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowMore than 2,000 people attended a thanksgiving service marking 70 years since the arrival of Caribbean migrants on the Empire Windrush ship to the UK.Hymns including Amazing Grace were played on steel drums as guests, including families of the Windrush generation, entered Westminster Abbey.The migrants were among the first to be recruited to rebuild post-war Britain.But there continues to be concern over a scandal which saw some of the generation wrongly face deportation. As the music played in the abbey, Baroness Floella Benjamin was applauded as she briefly danced in the nave.The Liberal Democrat peer and patron of the Windrush Foundation said that she felt ""joy"", adding: ""I was floating, like a bird, free.""Prime Minister Theresa May, Home Secretary Sajid Javid and London Mayor Sadiq Khan attended the service, along with shadow home secretary Diane Abbott.Among the guests was Baroness Doreen Lawrence, mother of murdered black teenager Stephen. At the service, a short drama telling the story of how Caribbean migrants were invited to ""The Motherland"" to help rebuild post-war Britain was performed by actors.Addressing the congregation, the Reverend Canon Joel Edwards said: ""Settling down hasn't been plain sailing.""The children of Windrush have experienced over-representation in Britain's prisons and mental health institutions. Knife crimes.""Underachievement in education and the job market. Settlement has meant racism, sometimes too much policing and not enough protection. And Stephen Lawrence.""But he added: ""Windrush resilience arises, supremely""He described the Windrush as having ""gifted"" Britain with leaders in the worlds of politics, business, education, music and sport and acknowledged the influence of the Caribbean on British cuisine, including ""rice and peas, jerk chicken and Levi Roots sauce in our supermarkets"".Rev Edwards also referenced the scandal that has seen some Windrush members wrongly face deportation.He said: ""In recent months the word 'Windrush' has evoked a great deal of emotion and even anger across our political landscape. In this service of thanksgiving, Windrush means more than migration.""The service included the first performance of a specially composed anthem entitled Psalm To Windrush: For The Brave And Ingenious.The Very Rev John Hall, Dean of Westminster, wore a robe decorated with a photo montage of aspects of black history in Britain since the arrival of Windrush.John Richards, 92, who came to Britain on the Windrush aged 21, said the service was ""great"".""It brings back memories, yes, but I'm too old for the emotion,"" he said.Alford Gardner, a member of the Windrush generation, has lived in Leeds most of his life, but said that was not his intention when he arrived.The 92-year-old said: ""The plan was to come to England, get a good job, work for about five years, go back... but it wasn't to be.""Within five years I had started a family and married. I had bought me house, working hard and settled down.""Mr Khan said it was a ""moving"" service in honour of a generation that ""contributes so much to our capital"".But Glenda Ceasar, who was born in Dominica in the 1960s, said she never got a British passport and lost her job recently because she could not prove her legal status.She said: ""So many years down the line... we're faced with this.""The ship to me, the Windrush, it seems as if it was... we were just slaves being brought over here to be punished later on in life. That's the way that I feel.""Nearly 500 Caribbean migrants from countries including Jamaica, Bermuda and Trinidad exited the Windrush on 22 June 1948 when it docked at Tilbury in Essex. They had applied to job adverts after World War II with the hope of finding long-term employment in the UK, having gained a type of citizenship under the British Nationality Act of 1948.The Westminster Abbey service commemorates the contribution the migrants and their families have made to the UK. Meanwhile, a celebration of Caribbean culture marked the anniversary at Tilbury Docks.The government has also announced Baroness Floella Benjamin is to lead a commemoration committee overseeing the creation of a ""fitting legacy"" to the Windrush generation. A statue celebrating their achievements is among the ideas for the permanent tribute.Baroness Benjamin, a former children's television presenter and Lib Dem peer, was born in Trinidad but emigrated to the UK with her family in 1960. She said: ""This a significant step in recognising the contribution made to Britain by Caribbean people and this committee will make sure the work and sacrifices of the Windrush pioneers will live on in the hearts and minds of future generations.""The right to remain in the UK for Commonwealth migrants who arrived before 1973 was supposed to be legally guaranteed. But it emerged this year that some migrants from the Windrush generation - many of them who arrived as children  - had faced deportation. They were being refused healthcare and access to jobs because they did not have the paperwork to prove their status following a tightening of immigration rules in 2014.The government has since apologised for the crisis and says a dedicated taskforce has now provided documentation to over 2,000 people demonstrating their right to live in the UK. Earlier this week, the government announced an annual Windrush Day would take place."
2018-06-22,EU tariffs on US goods come into force,https://web.archive.org//web/20180622155414/https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44567636,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe European Union (EU) has introduced retaliatory tariffs on US goods as a top official launched a fresh attack on President Donald Trump's trade policy.  The duties on €2.8bn (£2.4bn) worth of US goods came into force on Friday. Tariffs have been imposed on products such as bourbon whiskey, motorcycles and orange juice.European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said duties imposed by the US on the EU go against ""all logic and history"".Addressing the Irish parliament in Dublin, he added that ""we will do what we have to do to rebalance and safeguard"" the EU.In a tweet on Friday, President Trump threatened to go further by slapping a 20% tariff on all imported EU cars.Based on the Tariffs and Trade Barriers long placed on the U.S. and it great companies and workers by the European Union, if these Tariffs and Barriers are not soon broken down and removed, we will be placing a 20% Tariff on all of their cars coming into the U.S. Build them here!End of Twitter post  by @realDonaldTrumpThe Trump administration announced in March that it would introduce tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminium imported into the US.Mr Trump has argued that global oversupply of steel and aluminium, driven by China, threatens American steel and aluminium producers, which are vital to the US.After being deferred, the duties on steel and aluminium went ahead on 1 June and affect the EU, Canada, Mexico and other close US allies, including India.For its part, India has said it will raise taxes on 29 products imported from the US - including some agricultural goods, steel and iron products - in retaliation for the wide-ranging US tariffs.The new duties will come into effect from 4 August and will affect US almonds, walnuts and chick peas, among other products. South Korea, Argentina, Australia and Brazil have agreed to put limits on the volume of metals they can ship to the US in lieu of tariffs.However, Canada has announced it will impose retaliatory tariffs on C$16.6bn (£9.5bn) worth of US exports from 1 July.And Mexico put tariffs on $3bn worth of American products ranging from steel to pork and bourbon two weeks ago.Earlier this week, Mr Trump threatened to impose 10% duties on an additional $200bn (£150bn) worth of Chinese goods which he said would come into force if China ""refuses to change its practices"".However, China accused the US of an act of ""extreme pressure and blackmail"" and said it would respond with ""strong counter-measures"".President Trump believes that if you have a trade deficit - if you import more than you export - you are losing out.He is especially irked by the hefty deficits in US trade with China and Mexico, but has indicated that he will not let any country ""take advantage of us on trade any more"".Sorry, we cannot let our friends, or enemies, take advantage of us on Trade anymore. We must put the American worker first!End of Twitter post 2 by @realDonaldTrumpThe US trade deficit has increased in recent years, running at about $50bn (£38bn) a month.However, this could be the result of a stronger economy, with US consumers buying more goods from overseas. The new tariffs are meant to correct this imbalance.There were confrontational scenes and words after the recent G7 summit in Quebec, at which the leaders of other major world economies challenged Mr Trump's tariffs and trade policies. The majority of US goods targeted by the EU, such as tobacco, Harley Davidson motorcycles, cranberries and peanut butter, will now carry a tariff of 25%. However, the EU has introduced a 50% duty on goods such as footwear, some types of clothing, and washing machines.Many of the products the EU has in its sights are specifically chosen to have maximum political effect. Bourbon whiskey is produced in Kentucky, the state of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.Orange juice is a key export for Florida, a swing state in the US elections.Meanwhile, economists have warned the US tariffs could lead to higher metal costs, disrupt supply chains and even get passed on to US households. It's difficult to tell.US trade officials have said they deliberately targeted a list of imports that will not raise prices for consumers. But retailers and producers do not agree.Rick Helfenbein, president and chief executive officer of the American Apparel & Footwear Association, says the average family of four in the US will pay at least an extra $500 a year to buy consumer products affected by the tariffs.In some cases, the tariffs may simply compel firms to seek supplies from other countries rather than pay the extra cost. If, for instance, Florida orange juice goes up in price in Europe because of the EU counter-tariffs, then firms can always import Brazilian orange juice instead.For the US, that would be an unintended consequence of the tit-for-tat spat. But it's a good example of how trade wars can take unexpected turns."
2018-06-22,Hammond: Treasury not the 'enemy of Brexit',https://web.archive.org//web/20180622155414/https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44568125,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe Treasury is not ""the enemy of Brexit"", Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond has insisted.In a speech in the City of London, Mr Hammond said the UK needed to protect patterns of trade with the EU that had been ""built over decades"".The chancellor also used his Mansion House speech to confirm taxes will have to go up to boost spending on the NHS.But he said the increase would be partly funded by lower contributions to Brussels post-Brexit. In the past the chancellor has come under fire from supporters of Brexit.Earlier this month Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson called the Treasury ""the heart of Remain"", in comments to a private dinner. However, addressing a City audience on Thursday, Mr Hammond said the ""immediate key"" to the UK and London's economic success was ""ensuring we get a good Brexit deal"".He said the goal was a partnership that ""recognises that our European neighbours are our most important trading partners, and that Dover to Calais is the busiest trading corridor in Europe"".As the UK leaves the EU, he said the new relationship should ""maintain low friction borders and open markets"".He went on: ""That does not make the Treasury, on my watch, 'the enemy of Brexit'; rather, it makes it the champion of prosperity for the British people outside the EU, but working and trading closely with it.""Mr Hammond also said the £20bn five-year NHS funding package announced by the prime minister this week would be partly funded by lower contributions to Brussels.However, he also said the government would stick to its fiscal rules and ""continue to reduce debt"".As a result taxpayers will have to ""contribute a bit more"", he added.Earlier this week, Prime Minister Theresa May announced a boost in NHS spending, which will see NHS England's budget increase by £20bn by 2023.The plan also means more money will be given to the rest of the UK - about £4bn - although it will be up to the Welsh and Scottish governments to decide how that is spent.Mr Hammond said the NHS was the government's ""number one priority for the forthcoming spending review"".""So, as the Prime Minister said, taxpayers will have to contribute a bit more, in a fair and balanced way, to support the NHS that we all use.""

2018-06-22,"Probation system 'a mess', say MPs",https://web.archive.org//web/20180622155414/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-44568810,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe system for supervising criminals in England and Wales is in a ""mess"" after reforms failed to meet their aims, MPs have said.The Commons justice committee said it was ""unconvinced"" reforms could ever deliver an effective probation service.In 2014 the system was partially privatised and monitoring extended to those who had served short jail terms.The government said there had been ""challenges"" and it is due to publish the results of a review next month. BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said one option under consideration was to terminate the contracts of the rehabilitation companies in 2020, two years early.The arrangements for managing offenders were overhauled in 2014, with the probation service split in two.A new state body, the National Probation Service (NPS), was set up to supervise high-risk offenders, with 21 Community Rehabilitation Companies (CRCs) supervising low and medium-risk offenders.The ""Transforming Rehabilitation"" project, introduced by Chris Grayling when he was justice secretary, aimed to reduce reoffending rates.But the Justice Select Committee said that programme had left the system in a ""mess"", with staff morale at an ""all-time low"" and support for prisoners leaving jail ""wholly inadequate"".It said that splitting the management of offenders between a national body and 21 rehabilitation companies created a two-tier system, which has left the voluntary sector less involved than before.The MPs said the companies' performance in reducing re-offending is ""disappointing"", with some staff dealing with cases for which they have not been properly trained.Conservative MP and justice committee chairman Bob Neill said: ""The TR reforms had some laudable aims but these reforms have failed to meet them. We are unconvinced that TR will ever deliver the kind of probation service we need.""There are ""major questions"" to be answered on a range of issues, he said, including support given to offenders, the performance of probation providers, CRC contracts, poor staff morale and the voluntary sector's involvement.Mr Neill said: ""This has a negative impact on the number of individuals who go on to reoffend. Hardworking and dedicated staff are doing their best with a probation system that is currently a mess.""The MPs urged the Ministry of Justice to review the long-term future and sustainability of delivering the service, publishing findings by February.Prisons and probation minister Rory Stewart said it was a ""significant programme of reform"".""For instance, an additional 40,000 people who would not previously have been monitored now receive support and supervision upon release,"" he said.""Fewer people are re-offending and there have been some innovative and impressive programmes.""However, we accept that there have been challenges and it is clear that CRC services do need to improve.""We are currently in commercial discussions with providers and will consider all possible options to ensure we deliver this improvement."""
2018-06-22,Minister quits to oppose Heathrow plan,https://web.archive.org//web/20180622155414/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44561170,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowJunior trade minister Greg Hands has resigned from the government to oppose expansion of Heathrow Airport.The vote on whether to build a third runway at the airport west of London is due to be held on Monday.Mr Hands, who represents the Chelsea and Fulham constituency in London, said he had pledged to oppose the new runway at the 2017 election.It had been thought that ministers with constituencies directly affected could have been allowed to miss the vote.As the Government will be whipping the vote on Monday, this means I am resigning from the Government. It has been an honour to serve the Prime Minister (and her predecessor) for the last 7 years and I wish the PM & the Government every continuing success. https://t.co/GQedGcfy80End of Twitter post  by @GregHandsThe highest profile opponent of Heathrow expansion in the cabinet is Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, who once pledged to lie down in front of bulldozers to stop it happening.But Mr Johnson is scheduled to be out of the UK on Monday so will not be attending the vote in the House of Commons.Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson suggested on Twitter that Mr Hands' resignation should prompt the prime minister to allow her MPs a free vote: ""It's not too late for her to change whipping arrangements. This would also allow Boris Johnson to re-enter the country.""Green Party co-leader Caroline Lucas said the foreign secretary should quit too: If Boris Johnson has a backbone, or a shred of credibility left, he will join Greg Hands in resigning. #Heathrow https://t.co/zcOUInt2fEEnd of Twitter post  by @CarolineLucasPrime Minister Theresa May defended the foreign secretary's absence from a vote seen by some as crucial to the UK's post-Brexit international trade campaign, known as Global Britain. She said: ""The government is absolutely committed to increasing airport capacity at Heathrow. This is important, it is part of our future as Global Britain, and the ambitions we have as a trading nation for the future.""The foreign secretary early next week will be what I would describe as the living embodiment of Global Britain. ""He will be out there actually showing the UK's continued presence around the world, and the work that the UK continues to do around the world, with our diplomacy working on so many of the issues and challenges that we face across the world today.""Labour is also divided on the controversial issue, with members of the party's leadership, such as shadow chancellor John McDonnell, opposed to it, but high profile trade union backers in favour. The party's MPs are being allowed to vote however they want to on the issue.The SNP are in favour of Heathrow expansion, with the Lib Dems opposed and with the government deciding to whip (order) Conservative MPs to vote in favour, it is widely expected that the expansion plan will get Commons backing. A Downing Street spokesman said Mr Hands, who has held various ministerial roles and was chief secretary to the Treasury under David Cameron, had ""served the government with great ability and distinction over several years, and we thank him for all of his work"".Mr Hands will be replaced as a minister in the Department for International Trade by George Hollingbery, MP for Meon Valley. Meanwhile Mr Hands has tweeted that he cannot answer media calls about his resignation - because he is visiting a Romanian monastery:Am flattered by all the media calls about my resignation today, but it’s a bit awkward as am on pilgrimage at the Romanian monastery of Voronet. With the phone ringing/vibrating constantly I think the monks think I might be a drug dealer. In short: no media interviews. pic.twitter.com/2P2HxN0StaEnd of Twitter post 2 by @GregHandsThe debate on expanding Heathrow has been going on for nearly 20 years. The last Labour government backed the idea, and won a vote on it in 2009, but that plan was scrapped - and the idea of expansion put on hold for five years - by the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition formed after the 2010 election. But the idea of expansion was resurrected and has been subsequently backed by the Conservatives. Ministers approved a draft national airports policy statement in October but Parliament has  to give its approval for detailed planning to begin. Campaigners argue that a new runway will breach the UK's legal limits on air pollution and increase noise pollution with an extra 700 planes a day. It will result in huge disruption to residents of nearby villages, such as Longford, Harmondsworth and Sipson, with hundreds of homes likely to be knocked down. Robert Barnstone, from the No 3rd Runway Coalition, told the BBC the government was ""failing people and failing the environment as well"". Former Transport Secretary Justine Greening, who backs expanding Gatwick instead, suggested the idea of Heathrow as a national hub airport was outdated and the focus should be on improving regional capacity.And Tory MP Zac Goldsmith, who resigned his Richmond Park seat in 2016 over the issue and subsequently lost a by-election, said for many people ""this doesn't just look like a blank cheque being given by this government to a foreign-owned multinational, it looks like a whole book of cheques signed by our constituents"".Heathrow's owners, which include Spanish infrastructure firm Ferrovial, say the airport is virtually full and a new runway would increase its capacity from 85.5 million to 130 million passengers. The expansion is estimated to create about 60,000 new jobs and generate about £70bn in total economic benefits by the 2050s. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling has said it will provide a ""vital legacy"" for the British economy.Residents whose houses are knocked down will get compensation worth 125% of their value - as well as legal fees and stamp duty costs paid for - while £700m would be available to fund noise insulation measures for those who decide to stay.Mr Grayling has said a ban on night flights was an ""absolute requirement"" and non-negotiable while he said landing charges paid by airlines must stay at current levels.""This runway cannot be built if it does not meet air quality rules,"" he added.Sir Howard Davies, whose 2015 review recommended a new runway as long as environmental and community impacts were addressed, said ""significant"" concessions had been made on reducing early morning flights and minimising the impact on residents on the proposed flight path."

Maybe both sides did, a bit.Lots will be said and written in the next 24 hours about who really backed down after another day of shenanigans in Parliament - whips cornering potential rebels, even today, the grim sight of a Labour MP being forced to come to vote while visibly ill in a wheelchair and on morphine, the Tories so nervous about the vote that they suspended the normal rules that allow for ill MPs to stay out of the Chamber.As Westminster games go, it is getting pretty extreme. But ultimately, your view on whether the compromise had a winner, may depend on the side you are on.Both sides of course will claim they were the victor, the haggling over a deal took so long because both sides wanted to save face.The cabinet minister Liam Fox has just told us that nothing has really changed, it was just ""procedural"" and the fundamentals were exactly the same.In contrast, one of the organisers of the rebel group, Stephen Hammond, tweeted that the government has now conceded that Parliament would have a ""real say with no constraints"", if the final Brexit deal is rejected.The two sides will, guess what, continue to argue it for weeks to come, and every insult, every rankle, every cross word on this episode, being remembered in the difficult months to come.Here are two things however that are hard to dispute.The government was worried enough about losing today to budge, even if they only gave an inch.It might be a concession that only really parliamentary lawyers understand, but the PM had to move, again, despite not wanting to.And despite the fact that she did compromise even in a meaningless way (yes I can't believe that I did just write that sentence, but it is relevant), the vote was still relatively close, certainly not comfortable enough for the government to relax any time soon. What's also the case is that the Tory rebels, or potential rebels more like, weren't willing to take dramatic action in enough number to humiliate the PM.The vote result suggests that they have the hypothetical numbers, but their critics, and their internal opponents in the Tory party would question if they really have the guts.The former boss of the Treasury, Nick McPherson, no fan of Brexit it's important to say, has just acidly written online: ""Axiom of the last 30 years. Europhile Tories always compromise to preserve party unity, Their opponents don't. #thatswhywearewhereweare""But the last 24 hours has also been frustrating for Brexiteers.Many of them believe that Theresa May didn't have to push it this far, that she could have faced down the potential rebels without having to give any ground.There are many behind the scenes urging Number 10 to take a firmer line, to dare them to vote against her.Not the Parliamentary arithmetic, but the Tories' own arithmetic, makes them believe that she'd be easily able to do so, to end it once and for all and make plain that Brexiteers are the dominant force.But to face down the rebels who want to maintain closer ties to the EU or the Brexiteers would require the prime minister to risk something that she wants to avoid - to make the splits in Tory party more exposed, to make one side of the party the overt winner. For many months she has survived by tacking first an inch one way, and then the other.Today's events with a non-compromise-compromise suggest she is simply not ready to abandon that approach.But with so many more difficult decisions to come in the next few months, on both sides, Tories are more and more frustrated that she refuses to choose.One observes that Number 10 might believe the ""lesson of Maastricht"", is to try everything to keep the Tory party together, but the truth they suggest is that the real lesson of Maastricht is that any war is only over when one side is the clear victor.The trouble is, another source suggested, she never wants to say no to anyone, but when it comes to doing this deal, she simply can't say yes to everyone."

Instead, it suggests a picture of ""wait and see"".""We're nervous. Nothing is made clear about our status. It's promises and half-promises,"" says Ms Wilton-Godberfforde, who has been a research fellow at the University of Cambridge and is teaching French language and literature for the Open University.Her husband is a French, Cambridge-educated scientist and they have a young child - and the family is struggling with a sense that Brexit has made them feel ""unwelcome"".""It doesn't feel like home,"" she says.It's a conversation she says is running through universities - with European staff choosing whether to put down roots or to move away.If Ms Wilton-Godberfforde and her husband choose to stay in the UK, she doesn't know what type of bureaucracy and uncertainty will surround their new status. And she is ""massively upset"" at the sense that things are going backwards for her generation - and that barriers are being put up to her mobility.""It feels like everything is shrinking, we're penalised for looking outwards,"" she says.By contrast, Cambridge professor Robert Tombs is pro-Brexit and rejects the link between leaving the EU and xenophobia.""Britain is not a xenophobic country,"" he says in a podcast for a group putting the views of pro-Brexit academics.""Race relations are much better than in most European countries which are solidly in support of the EU.""There's no simple co-relation between disliking foreigners and not liking the EU."" There are, however, also job worries over Brexit and EU research funding.And Dr Wilton-Godberfforde says she worries about academics ""grappling for grants that no longer exist"".The Universities Minister, Sam Gyimah this week gave assurances that UK universities would have the full benefits of the current research round, even though it stretches beyond the UK's departure date from the EU.Even if there was no deal, the UK government had promised to underwrite any commitments, he said, answering an MP's question.""This guarantees funding for UK participants in projects ongoing at the point of exit,"" said Mr Gyimah.But there is even more EU research money at stake from 2021 - about 100bn euros in the next round - and so far not much clarity about the UK's access to this.The UK's universities, highly rated by international standards, have been among the biggest winners of EU funding, net beneficiaries by about 3.4bn euros in the most recent round.And they would have hoped to get a big slice of the next pot of research cash, but that is now uncertain.It's possible for non-EU countries to participate by paying for associate status. But that would also mean a loss of voting rights and giving up control over how the money is allocated.Universities UK are so far optimistic - saying that it's mutually advantageous for the EU to have access to top UK university researchers.But Ludovic Highman, at the Centre for Global Higher Education, at University College London, warns that it is ""not a given"".The decision will depend on the final Brexit negotiations.Will EU students stop coming to UK universities?There are about 135,000 EU students in UK universities - and their future status is more ""wait and see"".It depends on a reciprocal deal over the status of EU students in UK universities and UK students in the EU.This will determine whether UK students can carry on not paying tuition fees in Holland and whether EU students will continue to head for the sought-after universities in the UK.If, on the other hand, they become fully fledged ""overseas"" students, it will mean much higher fees.EU students are highest in number in Russell Group universities, in London - and, with the lack of tuition fees, in Scotland.Top 10 UK universities with the highest proportion of EU studentsIn overall numbers, UCL has the most EU students, almost 4,500. But the highest proportion, over 19%, is at the University of Aberdeen.On short-term exchanges, such as under the Erasmus scheme, it seems increasingly likely that the UK will continue to participate, paying to have associate status.There has been a spate of announcements of close partnerships between UK universities and European counterparts.But Imperial College London has gone a step further.The leading science institution has an arrangement with a French government research body that will give UK academics access to EU funding after Brexit.The Unite Mixte Internationale (UMI) Abraham de Moivre has been created as a maths laboratory in London, in partnership with France's National Centre for Scientific Research.This is the first time that the French government has co-funded such a research unit in the UK - and from the French perspective, this new centre in London will have the same status as a laboratory in France.For Imperial, it means staff at the new maths research unit will have equal access to funding, regardless of their nationality."
2018-06-22,Will there be a 'Brexit dividend'?,https://web.archive.org//web/20180622155414/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44523513,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe claim: Extra funding for the NHS, up to 2023, will be part-funded by a Brexit dividend.Reality Check verdict: Once the UK stops paying into the EU budget, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) says there will be savings. But this doesn't take into account the extra spending associated with leaving the EU and the potential economic impact, as forecast by the OBR.The debate over how to fund the NHS dominated the main exchanges during Wednesday's Prime Minister's Questions, with the subject of the ""Brexit dividend"" being brought up.The government says a combination of tax rises, economic growth and a ""Brexit dividend"" will help cover the costs of the increased spending in England's NHS budget.Under the plans, the NHS annual budget will increase by £20.5bn by 2023. On top of that, about £4bn will be given to the rest of the UK - although it will be up to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to decide how that is spent.So is the UK government right to claim that we can expect a ""dividend"" by leaving the European Union? When the government talks about a ""dividend"", it is referring to the annual contribution that we pay towards the European Union budget every year.According to the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) - the independent body that scrutinises the public finances - the UK contributed just under £9bn net to the EU budget in 2016-17.Under the government's current plans, the UK will remain a member of the EU until 29 March 2019 and it will continue to pay into the EU budget until then.After that there is a proposed transition period in order to give more time to negotiate a post-Brexit relationship with the EU. The transition is scheduled to last until the end of December 2020.The amount we pay during the transition period is expected to be similar to last year's net contribution.The OBR has set out what the potential savings might be. It believes the UK will start saving money from 2020, £3bn initially and rising to £5.8bn a year in 2022-23.That's based on how much we would have contributed to the EU budget, less the financial settlement or ""divorce"" bill.But it's not as simple as that.For one, while the OBR will have made some working assumptions about size of the ""divorce"" settlement, we still don't know what the final bill will be. The latest UK estimate for the total is cost is between £35bn and £39bn. This is based on calculations the UK and EU have agreed, not the final amount on which the two sides have settled.  In April the National Audit Office said that the final bill remains uncertain and much of it depends on future events. For some parts, like pensions, the UK would end up paying for decades.But the government has already committed to pay for certain things associated with the cost of leaving the EU.Last autumn the Chancellor Philip Hammond announced £3bn of funding over the next two years to help government departments prepare for Brexit.Furthermore, a significant amount of the money the UK currently contributes to the EU ends up coming back to the UK to fund things like agricultural subsidies and science and research funding.The government has said it will preserve the funding that farmers currently receive from the EU - at least until 2022. In 2017, that was worth just over £3bn.The UK also has to decide, among other things, if it will replace EU programmes that fund development in poor UK regions as well as research and development grants.On top of all this, there's also considerable uncertainty about how the economy will perform after Brexit. According to the OBR, the saving we get from no longer paying into the EU budget will be outweighed if the economy underperforms.It says that the impact of Brexit on the public finances will be largely determined by what happens to future tax revenues, which are linked to the strength of the economy.And the OBR is already forecasting extra borrowing of about £15bn a year because the UK voted to leave the EU from 2018-19 to 2020-21.It puts this down to things like lower immigration, lower productivity and higher inflation.The government has been disputing whether the economy will take a hit. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Monday: ""A lot of the forecasts have been wrong and in fact the British economy has been... a lot more resilient than many people were forecasting."" But he did not dispute that the economy has been slowing. Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questionsFollow us on Twitter"

But in the process he's angered anti-war activists and critics of British and Western foreign policy, who claim he's been biased against them. ""Christmas Day, Eid day, Easter Day, Cup final day, early hours of the morning, in the middle of the night - this man is on my case,"" says George Galloway, the former Labour and Respect Party MP. ""And it doesn't take an Einstein to work out he's not tending this garden with loving care or to make it look as nice as it can look. It's the opposite."" The subject of Galloway's ire is a prolific Wikipedia editor who goes by the name ""Philip Cross"". He's been the subject of a huge debate on the internet encyclopaedia - one of the world's most popular websites - and also on Twitter. And he's been accused of bias for interacting, sometimes negatively, with some of the people whose Wikipedia pages he's edited. The Philip Cross account was created at precisely 18:48 GMT on 26 October 2004. Since then, he's made more than 130,000 edits to more 30,000 pages. That's a substantial amount, but not hugely unusual - it's not enough edits, for example, to put him in the top 300 editors on Wikipedia. But it's what he edits which has preoccupied anti-war politicians and journalists. In his top 10 most-edited pages are the jazz musician Duke Ellington, The Sun newspaper, and Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre. But also in that top 10 are a number of vocal critics of American and British foreign policy: the journalist John Pilger, Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn and Corbyn's director of strategy, Seamus Milne.His critics also say that Philip Cross has made favourable edits to pages about public figures who are supportive of Western military intervention in the Middle East. He's recently caught the attention of bloggers and has been the subject of stories in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz and Russian state-owned outlets Sputnik and RT. There have been allegations on social media - all unproven - that he's a government agent, employed by rich and powerful media interests, or is a mainstream journalist with an obsessive hobby.You may also be interested in:""His edits are remorselessly targeted at people who oppose the Iraq war, who've opposed the subsequent intervention wars … in Libya and Syria, and people who criticise Israel,"" Galloway says. Recently Galloway offered a reward of £1000 to anyone who could provide information to reveal the editor's identity.The former MP says he's received information about Philip Cross and that the reward has already been claimed, but that he is not revealing the personal details of the person behind the account.When it comes to Galloway's page, the Philip Cross account is responsible for 20.4% of all edits.But it's difficult to get an overall sense of whether those changes were solely motivated by any particular political bias on behalf of the person behind the account.  More on this storyFor example, a sentence where Galloway criticised the Labour Party as ""Tony Blair's lie machine"" was removed, with Cross citing ""partial repetition, poor source"". In another case, Cross removed links to lurid tabloid headlines about Galloway's private life. In addition, many of the edits were simply grammatical or stylistic.  At one point Cross noted: ""It helps the article if each sentence or paragraph does not begin with 'Galloway' or 'He'.""Wikipedia, which was launched in 2001, relies on volunteers to write and edit entries. Wikipedians have developed an enormous set of rules and procedures guiding the development of a site which now has more than 5.5m articles in English.In addition to his Wikipedia edits, Philip Cross has a Twitter account which he has used to interact with Galloway and other politicians and journalists. In one tweet, for instance, he called a group of anti-war activists ""goons"". That raised claims of a conflict of interest, which is potentially against Wikipedia guidelines. The account is currently subject to a review process run by Wikipedia volunteers, although Philip Cross has promised to stop editing Galloway's entry for an ""indeterminate length of time regardless of any decision"".The Wikimedia Foundation - which established and funds Wikipedia - declined an interview request, but said in a statement:""Independent volunteer editors consistently monitor Wikipedia, often aided by technology, to ensure its articles remain neutral and well-sourced for the hundreds of millions of people who rely on it every month. ""If repeat violations to Wikipedia policies do occur, volunteers have a variety of mechanisms to draw from, including issuing warnings and blockings, to address content and behaviour that does not meet Wikipedia standards."" On Twitter, Wikipedia's co-founder, Jimmy Wales, rejected claims that Philip Cross is making entries biased.Of course there's only one person who could definitively lay to rest questions about the origins of the account - and that is Philip Cross himself.BBC Trending has been able to establish that he lives in England, and that Philip Cross is not the name he normally goes by outside of Wikipedia.

2018-06-22,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20180622155414/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-44470777,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe claim: The UK's 20-year devolution convention has been ""ripped up"".Reality Check verdict: The convention has been undermined but there is no legal reason why the UK government cannot ignore the Scottish Parliament over Brexit. Scotland's first minister says the passage of the UK's key Brexit legislation without the consent of the Scottish Parliament has ""ripped up the 20-year-old devolution convention"" in the UK. Is she right?Ms Sturgeon's tweet came after the House of Commons spent less than 20 minutes debating the EU Withdrawal Bill's impact on devolution. The SNP said that showed ""contempt for Scottish democracy"", with the party's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, leading a walk-out of his MPs during Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday.The row centres on a so-called ""power grab"", with the Scottish government accusing Westminster of keeping some powers for itself that should go to the Scottish Parliament at Holyrood, after Brexit.  The UK government says the ""temporary"" move will allow the same rules and regulations to remain in place across the whole of the UK in 24 key areas, such as agriculture, fisheries and food labelling.And it points out that the vast majority of the 153 areas where policy in devolved areas is currently decided in Brussels will go directly to the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly, meaning both will have considerably more powers after Brexit than they do now. Months of talks have failed to reach a deal - although the Welsh government dropped its opposition after changes were made that would put a limit on how long the UK government would keep the powers.Last month, the Scottish Parliament voted overwhelmingly to refuse consent for the Brexit bill, with the SNP being joined by Labour, the Greens and Liberal Democrat MSPs and only the Conservatives voting against. The UK government pressed on regardless - so how was it able to do so? When the devolved Scottish Parliament was set up in 1999, it was handed control over many policy areas such as health and education that had previously been decided at Westminster.However, an agreement signed by the two governments in 2001 stated that ""the United Kingdom Parliament retains authority to legislate on any issue, whether devolved or not"" and that it was ""ultimately for parliament to decide what use to make of that power"". It also stated that the UK government ""will proceed in accordance with the convention that the UK Parliament would not normally legislate with regard to devolved matters except with the agreement of the devolved legislature"". This agreement was inserted into the Scotland Act in 2016, which was drawn up after the independence referendum two years earlier.The word ""normally"" is, of course, an important caveat that is open to different interpretations - is Brexit ""normal"", for example?Scottish Secretary David Mundell said these were not normal times and a failure to proceed with the bill would jeopardise businesses across the UK.He accused the Scottish government of wanting a veto over arrangements that would apply to the whole of the UK and insisted the UK government ""followed the spirit and letter of the devolution settlement at every stage"" despite the failure to secure consent.  Consent is sought through something known as the Sewel Convention, named after former Labour government minister Lord Sewel, which, in effect, allowed the UK government to ask MSPs for permission to change the law in an area that is devolved to Holyrood. Similar conventions apply in both Wales and Northern Ireland. Until Brexit came along, the Scottish Parliament had only once before refused to give its consent - over some aspects of the Welfare Reform Bill in 2011, which resulted in the Scottish government introducing its own legislation to resolve the row. So Ms Sturgeon is correct to say that pushing through the EU Withdrawal Bill without the consent of the Scottish Parliament means that the long-standing convention has, in effect, been ""ripped up"".However, as its name suggests, it is merely a convention and there is no legal requirement for the UK government to seek Holyrood's permission - or to respect its decision if it says ""no"". This was confirmed by the Supreme Court last year, when it ruled on the case brought by Gina Miller about the triggering of Article 50, which started the Brexit process. Judges ruled that the Sewel Convention was not a legally enforceable rule despite being inserted into the Scotland Act.This meant that the Scottish Parliament did not have a veto over Article 50 or, by extension, the EU Withdrawal Bill. Regardless, ignoring the result of the Scottish Parliament vote was sure to provoke fury from the SNP, with Ms Sturgeon warning that ""the decision to act without our consent, and the manner of doing it, will not be forgotten"".Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questionsFollow us on Twitter"
2018-06-22,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20180622155414/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks  are now focusing on the detail of those issues and on future relations - after agreement was reached on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree within six months on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide, but first let's go back to the basics...It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.1% in the first three months of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.4%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand near a 40-year year low of 4.2%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 4.2% in the year to March 2018, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues. The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May was now put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. It will end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain-supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each playing roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanAn agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pounds buy fewer euros. A slump in the value of the dollar means the exchange rate with the pound is pretty close to where it was before the referendum.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.The UK has proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.A method for calculating the bill has been agreed, but the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more.The question of how and when payments will be made still needs to resolved, but it will be a schedule lasting for many years to come, and it is highly unlikely that anyone will ever be able to give an exact figure for the size of the divorce bill.UK sources say it will be up to £40bn, but some EU sources expect it to be higher than that. No-one can say for sure, and both sides want to keep it that way.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 6.5% in 2016 to 2.7% in 2017, according to the Halifax. It said the slowdown was driven by a squeeze on real wage growth.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-06-22,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180622155414/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to £840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

As I write, Mrs May is holed up with her advisers inside Tory HQ. But a former minister Anna Soubry has called for her to ""consider her position"" - political code for calling for her to resign. Read more from LauraJohn Curtice, Professor of Politics at the University of StrathclydeThis is the third post-war snap election called unexpectedly before a party's term of office had come to an end.  On the two previous occasions in 1970 and February 1974 the PM and the party lost office. While there is no other conceivable administration in the new parliament other than a Conservative-led one, it remains to be seen whether the PM will retain her position. However, so long as the Conservatives can reach an accommodation with the DUP they will have a working majority in the House of Commons.  BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed:When the general election exit poll was revealed at 10pm, the pound immediately dropped by 2% as investors took a position that a hung parliament was a possible outcome of the general election.Why would that cause the currency to decline? Because a hung parliament means that the government's direction of travel would be less certain.

The prime minister should also reserve the right to ""take with it the £39bn it has offered to pay as part of a divorce settlement"", it says.Signatories urge the government to accelerate plans to operate under World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules.Downing Street said it was confident the UK would get a good deal.Former cabinet ministers, economists and business figures including former chancellor Nigel Lawson, vocal Brexiteer John Redwood, and Wetherspoon chairman Tim Martin signed the letter.It was organised by Economists for Free Trade (EFT) and asks Mrs May to warn the EU that despite its ""intransigent and punitive stance"" Brexit cannot be stopped. Please upgrade your browser""We believe you could also make clear that your preferred outcome is a free trade deal between Britain and the EU, an arrangement that is to the mutual benefit of both parties,"" the letter says.It goes on to say that even though a free deal trade is ""eminently possible"", it believed it was ""time"" to move to a World Trade Deal under WTO rules ""in light of the reluctance of the EU swiftly to secure a free trade deal"".Britain is due to leave on 29 March 2019, 46 years after it first joined the European Economic Community, the forerunner to the EU.BBC political correspondent Ben Wright says the letter is ""a sign of how frustrated hardline Brexiteers are becoming"". He adds: ""The letter shows how intense the pressure is for Mrs May not to compromise, from some in her own party."" The UK wants to negotiate a ""comprehensive, bold and ambitious"" free trade agreement with the EU.If it can't achieve that, there are a number of other possible arrangements of varying depth before the UK reaches the point where it has no preferential trade relationship with the EU other than common membership of the WTO.If the UK had to trade under WTO rules, tariffs - a tax on traded goods - would be applied to all UK exports.The average WTO tariff varies from product to product, from 0% on mineral fuels and pharmaceuticals, to around 20-35% on processed food and 45-50% on meat.Reality Check: Does the UK trade with 'the rest of world' on WTO rules?The warning from well-known Brexit supporters comes after tens of thousands of people marched in central London, demanding a final vote on any UK exit deal..On Friday, plane-maker Airbus - which employs 14,000 people in Britain - said it could leave the UK if it exits the single market and customs union with no transition deal.Car maker BMW also warned that clarity is needed on a trade deal by the end of the summer, potentially affecting the company's 8,000-strong staff in the UK. In the letter, EFT says Britain can ""flourish, even without a free trade deal, because of benefits of leaving the EU"".""This would give the chancellor ample scope to increase spending on priority public services such as the NHS, while reducing the too high UK tax burden.""Earlier this week, Theresa May said a so-called Brexit dividend could be used to fund part of an extra £20bn a year for the health service.Although the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) calculates the UK will begin saving £3bn a year by 2020, this does not take into account Britain's expected £39bn divorce bill for exiting the EU.When asked about the EFT's letter, a Downing Street source said: ""We are confident of getting a good deal that delivers for every part of the UK and allows us to take back control of our money, rules and borders."""

The protest is part of a ""summer of action"" by campaign groups designed to increase pressure on Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn.The organisers have said that at least 100,000 people attended the march.World War Two veteran Stephen Goodall, 96, led the pro-EU protesters as they headed from Pall Mall to Parliament Square.There were boos from the crowd as the march approached Downing Street. After showing anger towards the PM, some began to chant ""where's Jeremy Corbyn?""Among those addressing the demonstrators was Gina Miller, who successfully campaigned to ensure the UK could not trigger talks on leaving without the approval of Parliament.She said: ""Together we must stand up, demand our voices are heard, demand a people's vote so that future generations can hear us say we did our bit we stood up and shouted for a country that's together, kinder, tolerant. ""This is not a time to be silent.""Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said Brexit was ""not a done deal"" and could be reversed, while Green Party co-leader Caroline Lucas told the crowd that Brexit ""will be a disaster for this country"".One of the rally organisers, James McGrory from pressure group Open Britain, said there should be ""a choice between leaving with the deal that the government negotiates, or staying in the European Union"".Britain is due to leave on 29 March 2019, 46 years after it first joined the European Economic Community, the forerunner to the EU. The government is giving Parliament a vote on the final deal, if one is reached, in the autumn - but it remains unclear what will happen if they reject it.

Michael Russell said the Scottish government no longer trusted UK ministers after they pushed through the Brexit bill last week.He was speaking as Nicola Sturgeon arrived in Guernsey for talks with UK Cabinet Minister David Lidington.Mr Lidington said governments should ""co-operate on the big issues"".He insisted the UK government was committed to maintaining a good working relationship with the devolved administrations despite the ""inevitable political noise"" over Brexit.And he urged the Scottish government ""to maintain their own side of that relationship"".Relations between the two governments are said to be at their lowest ever level after the Commons last week spent less than 20 minutes debating the EU Withdrawal Bill's impact on devolution, despite the Scottish Parliament voting to withhold consent. Ms Sturgeon has accused the UK government of ""ripping up"" the devolution settlement.The first minister also said she was ""proud"" of SNP MPs who walked out of Prime Minister's Questions in protest over the UK government's handling of the bill - a move that was derided as a ""pre-arranged stunt"" by opponents. Senior SNP and Scottish government figures have said the protest was not a one-off, and it would not be ""business as usual"" for devolution.Speaking to the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme, Mr Russell said he ""couldn't conceive of circumstances"" where MSPs would vote to give approval for further UK legislation related to leaving the EU, such as trade, agriculture and fisheries.He added: ""We are absolutely clear that the way that devolution operates and the structures of devolution have failed, and they failed because the UK government is refusing to operate them.""For example, on the Sewel Convention, we need to have the interpretation of that written down in statute and made legally binding, because what we've presently got is a situation where the UK government makes the rules and then breaks them themselves, and there are no sanctions.""He said that, while there was ""practical work"" to do to prepare for Brexit, ""it is very difficult to do that work because, frankly, we don't trust the UK government with it"".Ms Sturgeon and Mr Lidington are at a meeting of the British-Irish Council in Guernsey, which is also being attended by Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones and representatives from Guernsey, Jersey and the Isle of Man.Ahead of the meeting, Ms Sturgeon and Mr Jones issued a joint statement in which they repeated their call for the UK to remain in the single market and customs union after Brexit - which has already been ruled out by Prime Minister Theresa May. Airbus announced on Friday morning that it could leave the UK if the country exits the European Union single market and customs union without a transition deal.Mr Russell said the announcement was further evidence of the ""carnage"" in terms of jobs and the economy that Brexit could bring. The EU Withdrawal has been at the centre of a long-running row between Edinburgh and London, and has been pushed through by the UK government despite MSPs at Holyrood refusing to grant consent.It is the first time this has happened since the Scottish Parliament was created in 1999.Please upgrade your browserMr Lidington said voters expected the governments across the UK to work together and highlighted how Scotland had voted to remain part of the UK.He said: ""Working together is exactly what people all across the UK want to see their respective governments doing.""They want to see their lives being improved through joint endeavour. They don't expect different governments - with politicians from different parties - to agree on everything.""But they do expect us to keep talking - and listening - to each other, and to co-operate on the big issues that affect us all.""The UK government is committed to ""not normally"" passing laws that impact on devolved powers under something known as the Sewel Convention.But it argues that Brexit means these are not ""normal"" times, and that it needed to act despite not having Holyrood consent in order to allow a smooth transition after the UK leaves the EU.The row over the Brexit bill centres on 153 powers in what are now devolved areas, but which were sent to Brussels when the UK joined the EU in 1973. Westminster effectively wants to keep ""temporary"" control of 24 of these powers when they return to the UK after Brexit, with the remainder of the 153 going directly to the Scottish Parliament.It says having control in key areas such as farming and food labelling for the first few years after Brexit will ensure the same rules continue to be followed across the UK.The Scottish government wants all of the powers straight away - although it agrees that UK-wide rules and regulations are needed - and has repeatedly accused the UK government of a ""power grab""."

The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019.By Simon Jack, BBC business editorIt has been a source of exasperation for some cabinet members that although many companies have privately expressed concern - even alarm - at the progress of the Brexit negotiations, they have been reluctant to make their fears public, and have even dialled down the shrillness of their warnings when meeting the prime minister in person. Airbus's decision to warn that future investment in their operations in the UK is under review, while not exactly welcome, is therefore considered by some in government as an honest and helpful declaration of what's at stake for UK workers and the wider economy. Prominent Brexit supporter Sir Bernard Jenkin described Airbus's comments as the kind of ""speculation"" seen before, during and after the referendum from large companies.But Airbus's UK boss, Katherine Bennett, told the BBC: ""This is not project fear, this is dawning reality.""Mr Robertson said he needed to know what the government's preferred position was on customs and trade within months or his company - and the UK's - competitive position could be harmed.""If we don't get clarity in the next couple of months we have to start making those contingency plans...  which means making the UK less competitive than it is in a very competitive world right now,"" he said.""That is a decisive issue that ultimately could damage this industry.""BMW has previously warned about the damage of Brexit uncertainty, and in May chief executive Harald Krueger said the company had to remain ""flexible"" about production facilities.The company has built up an alternative manufacturing base in the Netherlands amid concerns about Britain's suitability as an export hub after Brexit.Airbus, in its Brexit ""risk assessment"" published on Thursday, said if the UK left the EU next year without a deal - meaning it left both the single market and customs union immediately and without any agreed transition - it would ""lead to severe disruption and interruption of UK production"".The European plane-maker said the warning was not part of ""project fear"", but was a ""dawning reality"".Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said any warning from any major company was taken seriously, but stressed that ""we genuinely expect to have a sensible partnership"" with the EU that was mutually beneficial.He said there had been a large number of investment announcements in the UK over the last 18 months.Security minister Ben Wallace stressed in a tweet the importance of UK military contracts to the plane-maker.When I last checked if it wasn’t for the customer countries of the A400m , Airbus would have not been able to cover the over budget and delays.

The RMT said it would hold a demonstration at the summit over its ongoing dispute with Northern over driver-only operated trains.Mr Cash said: ""He's scared of the passengers he's hung out to dry and he's scared of the staff whose safety-critical jobs his franchise shambles have left facing the axe.""A Department for Transport spokesman said: ""The Secretary of State is not attending the summit as he is in London for the National Policy Statement in Parliament, a hugely significant vote that will benefit the whole country, including the North West.""Meanwhile, a group of Greater Manchester MPs have written to Mr Grayling to say they are ""minded"" to vote in favour of a third runaway at Heathrow, but they want ""firm assurances"" that the government will invest in transport in the North.The cross-party group of 20 MPs said it was ""vital"" that any approval for Heathrow expansion ""does not impinge on the pipeline of the Northern Powerhouse projects""."
2018-06-23,£2.4m spent on Commons gagging clauses,https://web.archive.org//web/20180624063342/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44571120,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe House of Commons spent £2.4m on ""gagging clauses"" for former staff since 2013, BBC Newsnight has learned.Fifty-three departing members of the House of Commons Service signed contracts compelling them not to reveal information about the Commons.So-called ""non-disclosure agreements"" (NDAs) can be used to silence victims of bullying or harassment.A House spokesman said the clauses were used ""to resolve employment disputes under certain circumstances"".Newsnight uncovered the information via a Freedom of Information Act request, which was made as part of its investigation into bullying and harassment by MPs of members of the House of Commons Service - the apolitical employees who run the Commons and its committees. These people are usually referred to in Westminster as ""clerks"".Newsnight has previously reported that Angus Sinclair, formerly the Speaker's secretary, was paid £86,000 - more than a year of pay - as part of a settlement that entailed him signing a non-disclosure agreement. He felt he was being paid off to stay quiet about being bullied by the Speaker of the House of Commons (an allegation that the Speaker denies). The answer to the request reveals that £2.4m was spent on 53 settlements including gagging clauses with departing staff members since 2013. (The Press Association has, by the same means, got the same information which they are publishing independently.) The average settlement cost £45,418.Jill Rutter of the Institute for Government, said: ""The public sector should not be allowed to waste taxpayers' money on NDAs"". She said it was ""impossible to justify as [value for money]"".These figures are a slight underestimate. There may also be some other cases in 2012 and 2018, but the numbers involved are small enough that they fear publishing them would allow people to figure out information about identifiable individuals. The House of Commons reply to Newsnight clarifies that the NDAs were ""settlement agreements (formerly known as compromise agreements) which include a confidentiality clause"". It is unclear how many of these contracts were signed, as Mr Sinclair believes was the case for him, in order to prevent information about bullying or harassment leaking out.Newsnight has established, however, that confidentiality clauses were not standard in House of Commons exit deals: the annual report for the financial year 2016-17 shows 43 people left the House on ""exit packages"", but only 23 were given NDAs in all of 2016 and 2017.  We also know that people, known to Newsnight, who had made complaints about sexual harassment or bullying at the House were asked to sign NDAs when they left with an exit deal. Some other NDAs, however, were really a means of getting rid of a staff member more easily. Getting them to sign a non-disclosure agreement could be used as a justification for a bigger pay-off. Gagging clauses are sometimes suggested by unions to get more money out of employers for a departing member of staff. So while some of these NDAs may have been intended to keep the culture under wraps, it is not clear how many that applies to. The House of Commons, however, is now likely to face questions about its use of NDAs. The House of Commons does not have trade secrets, for example, that might justify the use of gagging clauses. Maria Miller, chair of the women and equalities committee, which is researching the use of NDAs, said: ""There needs to be more transparency on why payments such as this are being made in the first place.""

The marine environment is listed as the main topic for discussion, but Brexit was also discussed ahead of next week's EU summit in Brussels.Mr Varadkar said: ""We have made some good progress to date and I think it will be possible to come to a withdrawal agreement that works for everyone.""But we also need to be prepared for the possibility that that will not happen.""All EU countries will be stepping up preparations for all possible scenarios, including a no-deal Brexit.""It is the the fourth time the summit has been held in Guernsey.Mr Varadkar held bilateral discussions with Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones.British Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington also attended.Gareth Gordon, BBC NI political correspondentThe British Irish Council was set up under the Good Friday Agreement. Its sister organisation was the North-South Ministerial Council, which was made up of ministers from the Northern Ireland Executive and ministers from the Irish government. For obvious reasons, that has not met since just before the collapse of Stormont. Once again, the Northern Ireland parties will be absent at the British Irish Council due to the collapse of Stormont.The main topic for discussion is meant to be the marine environment, but Brexit is bound to loom large, especially ahead of of next week's EU summit in Brussels. The taoiseach did not make the summit dinner last night because had business in Dublin with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker. Instead, he flew in this morning. Mr Varadkar reiterated yesterday that Ireland expects Britain to honour its commitments and have no hard border.The Irish government issued a statement last night saying Mr Varadkar's meetings with the Scottish first minister and Welsh first minister will focus on the implications of Brexit. The council will also talk about the political situation in Northern Ireland and Mr Varadkar is expected to reiterate his regret that no Northern Ireland ministers are at the British-Irish Council summit. The meeting coincides with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker's two-day visit to Ireland.On Thursday, Mr Junker said that Ireland is not alone in Brexit negotiations and will remain backed by all member states.""This is not a bilateral question between Ireland the United Kingdom - this is an issue between the UK and the European Union,"" he said.""We want to make it clear again and again that Ireland is not alone.""We have Ireland backed by 26 member states and the commission - this will not change.""I am strongly against any temptation to isolate Ireland and not to conclude the deal on Ireland.""Ireland has to be part of the deal.""On Friday, he will also meet Irish President Michael D Higgins and visit the home of the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA), Croke Park, and the GAA museum.He will also watch a demonstration of Gaelic football and hurling."
2018-06-23,Watchdog expected to find Vote Leave broke rules,https://web.archive.org//web/20180624063342/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44567588,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAn investigation into whether the official Leave campaign in the EU Referendum broke electoral rules is scheduled to be published within weeks. The draft Electoral Commission's report concludes that Vote Leave and another smaller campaign group did break the rules, the BBC understands, and is expected to recommend at least one fine.  The latest investigation comes after allegations were made by the whistleblowers Christopher Wylie and Shahmir Sanni that the official Brexit campaign broke the law by colluding with a smaller group, BeLeave. It is understood that the commission did consider this new evidence, but it is not thought that the new information was decisive in proving a breach of the law. This is the first full formal investigation into Vote Leave, although the Electoral Commission had twice examined the campaign's behaviour. One source said that the draft report was ""bizarre"" and had ""gone way off track"" by focusing on the original information that has already been pored over, rather than additional evidence. It's suggested that the commission did not interview, nor request interviews, with the senior members of the Vote Leave Campaign team. Lawyers for those criticised in the report are understood to be challenging the draft findings, and publication could therefore be subject to delay. It is not clear if the commission plans only to recommend civil sanctions like fines, or also suggest referring the matter to the police or Crown Prosecution Service. Suggestions that the official Leave campaign, which featured senior Cabinet ministers, broke the law, would be highly controversial. Vote Leave and BeLeave have both always denied the allegations. An Electoral Commission spokesperson said: ""In accordance with its Enforcement Policy, the Electoral Commission has written to Vote Leave, Mr Darren Grimes and Veterans for Britain to advise each campaigner of the outcome of the investigation announced on 20 November 2017. ""The campaigners have 28 days to make representations before final decisions are taken. ""The commission will announce the outcome of the investigation and publish an investigation report once this final decision has been taken.""  Lawyer Tamsin Allen, who acts for Mr Sanni, Mr Wylie and a third whistleblower, said ""The legal opinion and evidence submitted to the EC demonstrated the grounds for suspecting that Vote Leave and BeLeave conducted an unlawful spending scheme.  ""If the Electoral Commission has indeed found those in the scheme guilty of  electoral offences, this is vindication for the whistleblowers, but a serious blow for the public and for the integrity of the referendum vote."""
2018-06-23,UK's plan for EU citizens who want to stay,https://web.archive.org//web/20180624063342/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44553225,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowEU citizens will have to answer three ""simple"" questions online if they want to continue living in the UK after Brexit, the home secretary has said.Sajid Javid said the government's ""default"" position would be to grant, not refuse, settled status.People will be asked to prove their ID, whether they have criminal convictions and whether they live in the UK.Their answers will be checked against government databases and a decision given ""very quickly"", said Mr Javid.The scheme will operate online and via a smartphone app, Mr Javid said, and would be ""as simple as people can reasonably expect"", with most decisions turned around within two weeks or sooner.Speaking to a House of Lords committee, Mr Javid said there would have to be ""a very good reason"" why an application would be refused.The Home Office said the criminal record checks would be about ""serious and persistent criminality, not parking fines"".The £170m scheme will be compulsory for all EU citizens living in the UK - the government expects a total of 3.5 million applications.EU citizens and family members who have been in the UK for five years by the end of 2020 will be able to apply for ""settled status"", meaning they are free to go on living and working in the UK indefinitely.Those who have arrived by December 31, 2020, but do not have five years' residence, can seek to stay until they have, at which point they can seek settled status.The scheme also includes citizens of Switzerland, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.Applications will cost £65 for adults and £32.50 for children and be free for EU nationals who already have residency or indefinite leave to remain.Applicants will be asked to provide their biographical information, declare whether they have any criminal records, and upload a facial photograph.The process requires verification of the applicant's identity and nationality using a passport, ID card or other valid document, which can be done using a smartphone app or through secure post.The government hopes to start trials within a few weeks, with people allowed to start registering in the autumn.Mr Javid told the Lords EU Justice sub-committee he wanted it to be fully operational by the ""start of next year"", adding that he wanted to avoid a ""surge"" of applicants when the UK leaves the EU in March.The scheme would run for at least two years after Brexit day, probably to around June 2021, said the home secretary.The hope is that most applicants will not have to provide supporting documents because their answers will be checked against HM Revenue and Customs and other government databases.Applicants with Android phones will be able to download an app which can read the chip in their passport to verify their identity - and they will be able to take a ""selfie"" that can be checked against Home Office records, said Mr Javid.But he said there was an ""an issue at the moment"" with Apple device users, who will not be able to make use of this app, and instead will have to send in their passport to prove their identity.The home secretary said he had raised the issue with Apple on a recent visit to Silicon Valley and the company was ""looking at it actively"".Analysis by BBC Home Affairs correspondent Danny ShawWhat the Home Office is embarking on is a hugely complex project within a tight timescale.  When challenged about the potential for it go wrong, officials point to the Passport Office as an example of a service successfully processing millions of cases every year. But unlike the biometric passport system, the EU registration scheme is being built from scratch. For hundreds of thousands of EU nationals, who have a straightforward and legitimate employment history in Britain and are comfortable using digital technology, their applications may well be resolved ""within days"", the time officials rather ambitiously claim cases will take. But for claimants hoping to bring in relatives, people unfamiliar with computers and those with a more sketchy background in Britain, perhaps involving some cash-in-hand work, the process may be a hurdle they'll struggle with - or avoid altogether.“After two years of being left in limbo, we don’t take things on trust… we want legally binding guarantees” @maikebohn on ‘settled status’ and rights of EU citizens in UK after Brexit #bbcdp pic.twitter.com/iCyREHpf4iEnd of Twitter post  by @daily_politicsLabour MP Yvette Cooper, chair of the Commons home affairs committee, said ""far more"" answers were needed from the government ""about what happens to those who aren't registered by June 2021 through no fault of their own, such as children"". ""At the moment it appears that if children aren't registered within the next three years then they will lose their legal rights even though they may have been here all their lives."" SNP home affairs spokeswoman Jo Cherry, speaking in the Commons, said: ""There are potentially significant numbers of people who could fall through the cracks here. ""If just 5% of the estimated three million EU citizens living in the UK don't register by the deadline there would be a population of nearly 200,000 left without status.""Former Labour minister Hilary Benn, who chairs the Commons Brexit Committee, asked ministers if the scheme would still stand in the event of a no-deal Brexit.Immigration Minister Caroline Nokes said: ""We have confidence that there will be a deal.""Sajid Javid promised there would be no repeat of the Windrush scandal - which saw people who had lived in the UK for decades threatened with deportation because they did not have the right paperwork - for EU migrants, adding ""lessons had been learned"".The new ""settled status"" scheme would establish the right of EU migrants to remain in the UK, unlike in the case of Windrush families where there was only an assumption they had a right to stay, without any documentary proof, he told the committee.The home secretary accused EU nations, such as France and Spain, of failing to match the UK's progress on plans for expats after Brexit.There are about 900,000 UK citizens in the EU, according to ONS figures.Both sides of the Brexit negotiations have resolved to secure the status of expats by the time the UK leaves the EU in March 2019.But any deal they reach will have to be ratified by the European Parliament and agreed to by member states.If the UK leaves the EU without a deal then the status of British citizens living in the EU member states is less certain.The UK would expect member states to allow Britons living in the EU the same rights as it plans to grant EU citizens in the UK but it would be down to individual countries to decide what to do."

Producing clothes requires toxic chemicals and produces climate-changing emissions. ""Every time we put on a wash, thousands of plastic fibres wash down the drain and into the oceans. We don't know where or how to recycle end of life clothing.""Our inquiry will look at how the fashion industry can remodel itself to be both thriving and sustainable.""The committee is inviting people to comment by September on the environmental impact of the fashion industry, waste, unwanted clothing and working conditions in UK garment factories.Among the questions it will ask is whether fast fashion is unsustainable, and what can be done to encourage people to buy fewer clothes and think more about how they are disposed of."
2018-06-23,Service celebrates Windrush anniversary,https://web.archive.org//web/20180624063342/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-44571616,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowMore than 2,000 people attended a thanksgiving service marking 70 years since the arrival of Caribbean migrants on the Empire Windrush ship to the UK.Hymns including Amazing Grace were played on steel drums as guests, including families of the Windrush generation, entered Westminster Abbey.The migrants were among the first to be recruited to rebuild post-war Britain.But there continues to be concern over a scandal which saw some of the generation wrongly face deportation. As the music played in the abbey, Baroness Floella Benjamin was applauded as she briefly danced in the nave.The Liberal Democrat peer and patron of the Windrush Foundation said that she felt ""joy"", adding: ""I was floating, like a bird, free.""Prime Minister Theresa May, Home Secretary Sajid Javid and London Mayor Sadiq Khan attended the service, along with shadow home secretary Diane Abbott.Among the guests was Baroness Doreen Lawrence, mother of murdered black teenager Stephen.By Helena Lee, BBC NewsUnder the warm June sun the guests, more than 2,000 of them, queued outside the abbey ahead of the service.They shared stories with each other. They wanted to celebrate. Many of them were families of the Windrush generation. Karen Gibson's mother came to Britain from Guyana in 1962.She said her mother heard stories of ""gold on the streets"" of the UK. There was a heart-warming moment too. A handshake between two men, in their nineties, who unknown to each other, had both been on the Empire Windrush ship 70 years ago. At the service, a short drama telling the story of how Caribbean migrants were invited to ""The Motherland"" to help rebuild post-war Britain was performed by actors.Addressing the congregation, the Reverend Canon Joel Edwards said: ""Settling down hasn't been plain sailing.""The children of Windrush have experienced over-representation in Britain's prisons and mental health institutions. Knife crimes.""Underachievement in education and the job market. Settlement has meant racism, sometimes too much policing and not enough protection. And Stephen Lawrence.""But he added: ""Windrush resilience arises, supremely""He described the Windrush as having ""gifted"" Britain with leaders in the worlds of politics, business, education, music and sport and acknowledged the influence of the Caribbean on British cuisine, including ""rice and peas, jerk chicken and Levi Roots sauce in our supermarkets"".Rev Edwards also referenced the scandal that has seen some Windrush members wrongly face deportation.He said: ""In recent months the word 'Windrush' has evoked a great deal of emotion and even anger across our political landscape. In this service of thanksgiving, Windrush means more than migration.""The service included the first performance of a specially composed anthem entitled Psalm To Windrush: For The Brave And Ingenious.The Very Rev John Hall, Dean of Westminster, wore a robe decorated with a photo montage of aspects of black history in Britain since the arrival of Windrush.John Richards, 92, who came to Britain on the Windrush aged 21, said the service was ""great"".""It brings back memories, yes, but I'm too old for the emotion,"" he said.Alford Gardner, a member of the Windrush generation, has lived in Leeds most of his life, but said that was not his intention when he arrived.The 92-year-old said: ""The plan was to come to England, get a good job, work for about five years, go back... but it wasn't to be.""Within five years I had started a family and married. I had bought me house, working hard and settled down.""Mr Khan said it was a ""moving"" service in honour of a generation that ""contributes so much to our capital"".But Glenda Ceasar, who was born in Dominica in the 1960s, said she never got a British passport and lost her job recently because she could not prove her legal status.She said: ""So many years down the line... we're faced with this.""The ship to me, the Windrush, it seems as if it was... we were just slaves being brought over here to be punished later on in life. That's the way that I feel.""Nearly 500 Caribbean migrants from countries including Jamaica, Bermuda and Trinidad exited the Windrush on 22 June 1948 when it docked at Tilbury in Essex. They had applied to job adverts after World War II with the hope of finding long-term employment in the UK, having gained a type of citizenship under the British Nationality Act of 1948.The Westminster Abbey service commemorates the contribution the migrants and their families have made to the UK. Meanwhile, a celebration of Caribbean culture marked the anniversary at Tilbury Docks.The government has also announced Baroness Floella Benjamin is to lead a commemoration committee overseeing the creation of a ""fitting legacy"" to the Windrush generation. A statue celebrating their achievements is among the ideas for the permanent tribute.Baroness Benjamin, a former children's television presenter and Lib Dem peer, was born in Trinidad but emigrated to the UK with her family in 1960. She said: ""This a significant step in recognising the contribution made to Britain by Caribbean people and this committee will make sure the work and sacrifices of the Windrush pioneers will live on in the hearts and minds of future generations.""The right to remain in the UK for Commonwealth migrants who arrived before 1973 was supposed to be legally guaranteed. But it emerged this year that some migrants from the Windrush generation - many of them who arrived as children  - had faced deportation. They were being refused healthcare and access to jobs because they did not have the paperwork to prove their status following a tightening of immigration rules in 2014.The government has since apologised for the crisis and says a dedicated taskforce has now provided documentation to over 2,000 people demonstrating their right to live in the UK. Earlier this week, the government announced an annual Windrush Day would take place."

But the 69-year-old decided to travel from South Normanton in Derbyshire to call for a ""People's Vote"".""I'm hoping it's not too late, but we have got to take the chance for goodness sake,"" she said.""These crowds of people make me emotional. I've seen signs about futures being stolen and it brings tears to my eyes. I want to march and I want a vote.""Her husband, John Pearce, carried a placard saying ""grumpy old Brits"". ""The first referendum was won on spurious information from both sides,"" he said. ""Now we know a lot more, I think people have changed their minds, both ways, and deserve a chance to vote.""Cinzia Sangiovanni has lived in the UK for 19 years, and lives in south London with her British husband and two children.The whole family took part in the march, as three of them hold Italian passports - and she fears for their future without a say on the deal. ""I want to march because I feel my rights are under threat,"" she said.""If I was told to, I wouldn't be able to just turn around and go back to Italy. I just worry for the future.""Among the sea of EU flags was Erika Gallacher, who moved from Carlisle to London 11 years ago.""I have friends who voted a different way to me, but I also have a lot of friends from the EU,"" she said.""I work for a university and I'm worried about the students and what will happen to them. ""But for me, I also worry about my future, starting a family and bringing up children. I cannot see any good to it for them.""Leo Buckley was prominent at the head of the march with his placard, reading: ""Brexit has stolen my future.""The 16-year-old from Hampshire said: ""I think my placard says it all.""It is stealing it economically - we have already seen the drop in the pound and the loss of jobs - so I will struggle to find employment and be worse off when I do. ""And also socially - look at the rise in hate crime and xenophobia. I don't want Brexit to become the poster boy of a return to attitudes from the 1930s.""A group calling themselves the ""Suffolk EU Alliance"" were also out in force carrying placards and plastered in stickers stating their cause. Christine Speer was one of them - originally from Canada, but a British citizen for 50 years who considers herself a ""citizen of nowhere"". ""The EU has its problems, but there are a number of problems at the time of the referendum that weren't because of the EU - the government was responsible,"" she said. ""Some people who voted for Brexit will actually find they are worse off. ""Ideally it would be better if Brexit didn't happen, but if it does, the public needs to have a say.""Dr Horst-Dieter Haas proudly carried his German flag as he attended the march. He married a British woman, but the pair spent 30 years in his home country, bringing up their children, before moving to the UK. He has been working in the NHS since 2005, but says he will quit if Brexit goes ahead. He added: ""It is already impacting the NHS. We haven't got enough doctors, nurses, physiotherapists, we don't even have enough money, and that will all be worse if Brexit happens. ""The NHS is not performing and there are too many lies about the benefits. I will definitely be stopping if we leave.""But as the pro-EU protest reached its rally point in Parliament Square, another was heading in the same direction. The UK Unity and Freedom march said it was focusing on ""freedom from the EU, freedom from terror, freedom of speech, freedom from Sharia law, and unity of all people, irrespective of race or creed"".The pro-Brexit march was significantly smaller, but their voices rang out as they walked along Millbank, with supporters chanting for ""our country back"" and singing Rule, Britannia!Shazia Hobbs, who was speaking at the event, criticised those on the opposing protest. ""That march is silly,"" she said. ""We voted to leave so we should leave. ""What do they want, best of three? We voted for Brexit.""One woman, who didn't want to be named, had travelled from Brighton to join the march.She said: ""I'm on this march because I am a patriot. The EU is an undemocratic and authoritarian establishment. We need to be a self-governing nation.""And a man, who also did not want to be named, added: ""I don't like big government. That is what the EU is."" Whether either protest will impact the government's next steps is yet to be seen. "

Maybe both sides did, a bit.Lots will be said and written in the next 24 hours about who really backed down after another day of shenanigans in Parliament - whips cornering potential rebels, even today, the grim sight of a Labour MP being forced to come to vote while visibly ill in a wheelchair and on morphine, the Tories so nervous about the vote that they suspended the normal rules that allow for ill MPs to stay out of the Chamber.As Westminster games go, it is getting pretty extreme. But ultimately, your view on whether the compromise had a winner, may depend on the side you are on.Both sides of course will claim they were the victor, the haggling over a deal took so long because both sides wanted to save face.The cabinet minister Liam Fox has just told us that nothing has really changed, it was just ""procedural"" and the fundamentals were exactly the same.In contrast, one of the organisers of the rebel group, Stephen Hammond, tweeted that the government has now conceded that Parliament would have a ""real say with no constraints"", if the final Brexit deal is rejected.The two sides will, guess what, continue to argue it for weeks to come, and every insult, every rankle, every cross word on this episode, being remembered in the difficult months to come.Here are two things however that are hard to dispute.The government was worried enough about losing today to budge, even if they only gave an inch.It might be a concession that only really parliamentary lawyers understand, but the PM had to move, again, despite not wanting to.And despite the fact that she did compromise even in a meaningless way (yes I can't believe that I did just write that sentence, but it is relevant), the vote was still relatively close, certainly not comfortable enough for the government to relax any time soon. What's also the case is that the Tory rebels, or potential rebels more like, weren't willing to take dramatic action in enough number to humiliate the PM.The vote result suggests that they have the hypothetical numbers, but their critics, and their internal opponents in the Tory party would question if they really have the guts.The former boss of the Treasury, Nick McPherson, no fan of Brexit it's important to say, has just acidly written online: ""Axiom of the last 30 years. Europhile Tories always compromise to preserve party unity, Their opponents don't. #thatswhywearewhereweare""But the last 24 hours has also been frustrating for Brexiteers.Many of them believe that Theresa May didn't have to push it this far, that she could have faced down the potential rebels without having to give any ground.There are many behind the scenes urging Number 10 to take a firmer line, to dare them to vote against her.Not the Parliamentary arithmetic, but the Tories' own arithmetic, makes them believe that she'd be easily able to do so, to end it once and for all and make plain that Brexiteers are the dominant force.But to face down the rebels who want to maintain closer ties to the EU or the Brexiteers would require the prime minister to risk something that she wants to avoid - to make the splits in Tory party more exposed, to make one side of the party the overt winner. For many months she has survived by tacking first an inch one way, and then the other.Today's events with a non-compromise-compromise suggest she is simply not ready to abandon that approach.But with so many more difficult decisions to come in the next few months, on both sides, Tories are more and more frustrated that she refuses to choose.One observes that Number 10 might believe the ""lesson of Maastricht"", is to try everything to keep the Tory party together, but the truth they suggest is that the real lesson of Maastricht is that any war is only over when one side is the clear victor.The trouble is, another source suggested, she never wants to say no to anyone, but when it comes to doing this deal, she simply can't say yes to everyone."
2018-06-23,Stay or go?,https://web.archive.org//web/20180624063342/https://www.bbc.com/news/education-44456240,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowEmilia Wilton-Godberfforde is facing a big decision - will she continue working as an academic in UK universities after Brexit?She is British but her husband is French and they are worried about the uncertainty of their future status and what she calls rising ""xenophobia"".They also fear a loss of EU research funding will threaten university jobs.The universities minister says UK access to EU research budgets will ""remain unchanged"" until at least 2020.There are about 36,000 academics from European Union countries working in UK universities - and there are others such as Ms Wilton-Godberfforde who have family links to European researchers and academics.EU nationals are about 17% of the UK's academics - and since the referendum there have been brain drain warnings from universities.Margaret Gardner, vice-chancellor of Monash University, in Australia, recently said Australian universities were already poaching academics from the UK.But so far the evidence doesn't show an academic stampede. Instead, it suggests a picture of ""wait and see"".""We're nervous. Nothing is made clear about our status. It's promises and half-promises,"" says Ms Wilton-Godberfforde, who has been a research fellow at the University of Cambridge and is teaching French language and literature for the Open University.Her husband is a French, Cambridge-educated scientist and they have a young child - and the family is struggling with a sense that Brexit has made them feel ""unwelcome"".""It doesn't feel like home,"" she says.It's a conversation she says is running through universities - with European staff choosing whether to put down roots or to move away.If Ms Wilton-Godberfforde and her husband choose to stay in the UK, she doesn't know what type of bureaucracy and uncertainty will surround their new status. And she is ""massively upset"" at the sense that things are going backwards for her generation - and that barriers are being put up to her mobility.""It feels like everything is shrinking, we're penalised for looking outwards,"" she says.By contrast, Cambridge professor Robert Tombs is pro-Brexit and rejects the link between leaving the EU and xenophobia.""Britain is not a xenophobic country,"" he says in a podcast for a group putting the views of pro-Brexit academics.""Race relations are much better than in most European countries which are solidly in support of the EU.""There's no simple co-relation between disliking foreigners and not liking the EU."" There are, however, also job worries over Brexit and EU research funding.And Dr Wilton-Godberfforde says she worries about academics ""grappling for grants that no longer exist"".The Universities Minister, Sam Gyimah this week gave assurances that UK universities would have the full benefits of the current research round, even though it stretches beyond the UK's departure date from the EU.Even if there was no deal, the UK government had promised to underwrite any commitments, he said, answering an MP's question.""This guarantees funding for UK participants in projects ongoing at the point of exit,"" said Mr Gyimah.But there is even more EU research money at stake from 2021 - about 100bn euros in the next round - and so far not much clarity about the UK's access to this.The UK's universities, highly rated by international standards, have been among the biggest winners of EU funding, net beneficiaries by about 3.4bn euros in the most recent round.And they would have hoped to get a big slice of the next pot of research cash, but that is now uncertain.It's possible for non-EU countries to participate by paying for associate status. But that would also mean a loss of voting rights and giving up control over how the money is allocated.Universities UK are so far optimistic - saying that it's mutually advantageous for the EU to have access to top UK university researchers.But Ludovic Highman, at the Centre for Global Higher Education, at University College London, warns that it is ""not a given"".The decision will depend on the final Brexit negotiations.Will EU students stop coming to UK universities?There are about 135,000 EU students in UK universities - and their future status is more ""wait and see"".It depends on a reciprocal deal over the status of EU students in UK universities and UK students in the EU.This will determine whether UK students can carry on not paying tuition fees in Holland and whether EU students will continue to head for the sought-after universities in the UK.If, on the other hand, they become fully fledged ""overseas"" students, it will mean much higher fees.EU students are highest in number in Russell Group universities, in London - and, with the lack of tuition fees, in Scotland.Top 10 UK universities with the highest proportion of EU studentsIn overall numbers, UCL has the most EU students, almost 4,500. But the highest proportion, over 19%, is at the University of Aberdeen.On short-term exchanges, such as under the Erasmus scheme, it seems increasingly likely that the UK will continue to participate, paying to have associate status.There has been a spate of announcements of close partnerships between UK universities and European counterparts.But Imperial College London has gone a step further.The leading science institution has an arrangement with a French government research body that will give UK academics access to EU funding after Brexit.The Unite Mixte Internationale (UMI) Abraham de Moivre has been created as a maths laboratory in London, in partnership with France's National Centre for Scientific Research.This is the first time that the French government has co-funded such a research unit in the UK - and from the French perspective, this new centre in London will have the same status as a laboratory in France.For Imperial, it means staff at the new maths research unit will have equal access to funding, regardless of their nationality."
2018-06-23,Will there be a 'Brexit dividend'?,https://web.archive.org//web/20180624063342/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44523513,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe claim: Extra funding for the NHS, up to 2023, will be part-funded by a Brexit dividend.Reality Check verdict: Once the UK stops paying into the EU budget, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) says there will be savings. But this doesn't take into account the extra spending associated with leaving the EU and the potential economic impact, as forecast by the OBR.The debate over how to fund the NHS dominated the main exchanges during Wednesday's Prime Minister's Questions, with the subject of the ""Brexit dividend"" being brought up.The government says a combination of tax rises, economic growth and a ""Brexit dividend"" will help cover the costs of the increased spending in England's NHS budget.Under the plans, the NHS annual budget will increase by £20.5bn by 2023. On top of that, about £4bn will be given to the rest of the UK - although it will be up to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to decide how that is spent.So is the UK government right to claim that we can expect a ""dividend"" by leaving the European Union? When the government talks about a ""dividend"", it is referring to the annual contribution that we pay towards the European Union budget every year.According to the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) - the independent body that scrutinises the public finances - the UK contributed just under £9bn net to the EU budget in 2016-17.Under the government's current plans, the UK will remain a member of the EU until 29 March 2019 and it will continue to pay into the EU budget until then.After that there is a proposed transition period in order to give more time to negotiate a post-Brexit relationship with the EU. The transition is scheduled to last until the end of December 2020.The amount we pay during the transition period is expected to be similar to last year's net contribution.The OBR has set out what the potential savings might be. It believes the UK will start saving money from 2020, £3bn initially and rising to £5.8bn a year in 2022-23.That's based on how much we would have contributed to the EU budget, less the financial settlement or ""divorce"" bill.But it's not as simple as that.For one, while the OBR will have made some working assumptions about size of the ""divorce"" settlement, we still don't know what the final bill will be. The latest UK estimate for the total is cost is between £35bn and £39bn. This is based on calculations the UK and EU have agreed, not the final amount on which the two sides have settled.  In April the National Audit Office said that the final bill remains uncertain and much of it depends on future events. For some parts, like pensions, the UK would end up paying for decades.But the government has already committed to pay for certain things associated with the cost of leaving the EU.Last autumn the Chancellor Philip Hammond announced £3bn of funding over the next two years to help government departments prepare for Brexit.Furthermore, a significant amount of the money the UK currently contributes to the EU ends up coming back to the UK to fund things like agricultural subsidies and science and research funding.The government has said it will preserve the funding that farmers currently receive from the EU - at least until 2022. In 2017, that was worth just over £3bn.The UK also has to decide, among other things, if it will replace EU programmes that fund development in poor UK regions as well as research and development grants.On top of all this, there's also considerable uncertainty about how the economy will perform after Brexit. According to the OBR, the saving we get from no longer paying into the EU budget will be outweighed if the economy underperforms.It says that the impact of Brexit on the public finances will be largely determined by what happens to future tax revenues, which are linked to the strength of the economy.And the OBR is already forecasting extra borrowing of about £15bn a year because the UK voted to leave the EU from 2018-19 to 2020-21.It puts this down to things like lower immigration, lower productivity and higher inflation.The government has been disputing whether the economy will take a hit. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Monday: ""A lot of the forecasts have been wrong and in fact the British economy has been... a lot more resilient than many people were forecasting."" But he did not dispute that the economy has been slowing. Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questionsFollow us on Twitter"

But in the process he's angered anti-war activists and critics of British and Western foreign policy, who claim he's been biased against them. ""Christmas Day, Eid day, Easter Day, Cup final day, early hours of the morning, in the middle of the night - this man is on my case,"" says George Galloway, the former Labour and Respect Party MP. ""And it doesn't take an Einstein to work out he's not tending this garden with loving care or to make it look as nice as it can look. It's the opposite."" The subject of Galloway's ire is a prolific Wikipedia editor who goes by the name ""Philip Cross"". He's been the subject of a huge debate on the internet encyclopaedia - one of the world's most popular websites - and also on Twitter. And he's been accused of bias for interacting, sometimes negatively, with some of the people whose Wikipedia pages he's edited. The Philip Cross account was created at precisely 18:48 GMT on 26 October 2004. Since then, he's made more than 130,000 edits to more 30,000 pages. That's a substantial amount, but not hugely unusual - it's not enough edits, for example, to put him in the top 300 editors on Wikipedia. But it's what he edits which has preoccupied anti-war politicians and journalists. In his top 10 most-edited pages are the jazz musician Duke Ellington, The Sun newspaper, and Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre. But also in that top 10 are a number of vocal critics of American and British foreign policy: the journalist John Pilger, Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn and Corbyn's director of strategy, Seamus Milne.His critics also say that Philip Cross has made favourable edits to pages about public figures who are supportive of Western military intervention in the Middle East. He's recently caught the attention of bloggers and has been the subject of stories in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz and Russian state-owned outlets Sputnik and RT. There have been allegations on social media - all unproven - that he's a government agent, employed by rich and powerful media interests, or is a mainstream journalist with an obsessive hobby.You may also be interested in:""His edits are remorselessly targeted at people who oppose the Iraq war, who've opposed the subsequent intervention wars … in Libya and Syria, and people who criticise Israel,"" Galloway says. Recently Galloway offered a reward of £1000 to anyone who could provide information to reveal the editor's identity.The former MP says he's received information about Philip Cross and that the reward has already been claimed, but that he is not revealing the personal details of the person behind the account.When it comes to Galloway's page, the Philip Cross account is responsible for 20.4% of all edits.But it's difficult to get an overall sense of whether those changes were solely motivated by any particular political bias on behalf of the person behind the account.  More on this storyFor example, a sentence where Galloway criticised the Labour Party as ""Tony Blair's lie machine"" was removed, with Cross citing ""partial repetition, poor source"". In another case, Cross removed links to lurid tabloid headlines about Galloway's private life. In addition, many of the edits were simply grammatical or stylistic.  At one point Cross noted: ""It helps the article if each sentence or paragraph does not begin with 'Galloway' or 'He'.""Wikipedia, which was launched in 2001, relies on volunteers to write and edit entries. Wikipedians have developed an enormous set of rules and procedures guiding the development of a site which now has more than 5.5m articles in English.In addition to his Wikipedia edits, Philip Cross has a Twitter account which he has used to interact with Galloway and other politicians and journalists. In one tweet, for instance, he called a group of anti-war activists ""goons"". That raised claims of a conflict of interest, which is potentially against Wikipedia guidelines. The account is currently subject to a review process run by Wikipedia volunteers, although Philip Cross has promised to stop editing Galloway's entry for an ""indeterminate length of time regardless of any decision"".The Wikimedia Foundation - which established and funds Wikipedia - declined an interview request, but said in a statement:""Independent volunteer editors consistently monitor Wikipedia, often aided by technology, to ensure its articles remain neutral and well-sourced for the hundreds of millions of people who rely on it every month. ""If repeat violations to Wikipedia policies do occur, volunteers have a variety of mechanisms to draw from, including issuing warnings and blockings, to address content and behaviour that does not meet Wikipedia standards."" On Twitter, Wikipedia's co-founder, Jimmy Wales, rejected claims that Philip Cross is making entries biased.Of course there's only one person who could definitively lay to rest questions about the origins of the account - and that is Philip Cross himself.BBC Trending has been able to establish that he lives in England, and that Philip Cross is not the name he normally goes by outside of Wikipedia.

2018-06-23,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20180624063342/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks  are now focusing on the detail of those issues and on future relations - after agreement was reached on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree within six months on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide, but first let's go back to the basics...It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.1% in the first three months of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.4%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand near a 40-year year low of 4.2%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 4.2% in the year to March 2018, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues. The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May was now put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. It will end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain-supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each playing roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanAn agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pounds buy fewer euros. A slump in the value of the dollar means the exchange rate with the pound is pretty close to where it was before the referendum.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.The UK has proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.A method for calculating the bill has been agreed, but the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more.The question of how and when payments will be made still needs to resolved, but it will be a schedule lasting for many years to come, and it is highly unlikely that anyone will ever be able to give an exact figure for the size of the divorce bill.UK sources say it will be up to £40bn, but some EU sources expect it to be higher than that. No-one can say for sure, and both sides want to keep it that way.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 6.5% in 2016 to 2.7% in 2017, according to the Halifax. It said the slowdown was driven by a squeeze on real wage growth.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-06-23,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180624063342/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to £840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

As I write, Mrs May is holed up with her advisers inside Tory HQ. But a former minister Anna Soubry has called for her to ""consider her position"" - political code for calling for her to resign.

On the two previous occasions in 1970 and February 1974 the PM and the party lost office. While there is no other conceivable administration in the new parliament other than a Conservative-led one, it remains to be seen whether the PM will retain her position. However, so long as the Conservatives can reach an accommodation with the DUP they will have a working majority in the House of Commons.  BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed:When the general election exit poll was revealed at 10pm, the pound immediately dropped by 2% as investors took a position that a hung parliament was a possible outcome of the general election.Why would that cause the currency to decline? Because a hung parliament means that the government's direction of travel would be less certain.

The People's Vote campaign argues the public should have the final say on the terms of Britain's exit from the EU.  No senior Labour figures joined the demonstration and there were chants of ""where's Jeremy Corbyn?"" Frontbenchers Nia Griffith and Rebecca Long-Bailey said Mr Corbyn had been visiting a refugee camp in Jordan.Lib Dem Leader Sir Vince Cable and the Green Party's Caroline Lucas spoke at the event, which took place on the second anniversary of the EU referendum.Backbencher David Lammy was the most senior Labour figure to address the crowds, which organisers have said numbered at least 100,000, athough several pro-EU Labour MPs, including Chris Leslie, Stella Creasey and Stephen Doughty took part in the march.Ms Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, who was at a constituency event on Saturday, said: ""I understand why people wanted to march yesterday - it is a highly emotive issue.""But, she told BBC Radio 5's Pienaar's Politics, a second referendum was not Labour policy and she had ""significant concerns"" about the idea.She said the government would ""hold the pen about what is contained within the referendum"" and would, she claimed, be unlikely to offer staying in the EU as an option on the ballot paper.She said another referendum ""has the potential to divide the country yet again at a time when we should be bringing people together"" and the priority now should be to get a Brexit deal that ""suits our economy, protects jobs and puts a floor under existing rights and protections"".She denied the Labour leadership was out of step with party members, most of whom, according to a recent poll, are in favour of a second referendum.""I wouldn't accept that,"" she told John Pienaar.Labour's shadow defence secretary Nia Griffith said: ""Of course people in a democratic country can do what they like and have marches and that's good and they should express their opinions.""But she said Labour had accepted the result of the June 2016 EU referendum and was now working for ""a Brexit that works the best way possible for the economy and for jobs"".A People's Voice spokesman said they needed to get the Labour leadership on board to make a new referendum a ""realistic proposition"" and the party should ""reflect the wishes of its own membership"" on the issue.Actor and Labour activist Sir Tony Robinson, a leading supporter of the People's Voice campaign who spoke at Saturday's rally in central London, accused Jeremy Corbyn of ignoring the views of the party's members and trying to shut down debate on a second referendum. ""He knows what he's doing and actually, objectively, what he is doing is supporting Theresa May in trying to shuffle through this awfully badly negotiated Brexit that we may be heading towards,"" he told Pienaar's Politics.The actor, who has criticised Mr Corbyn in the past, said he wanted to see Brexit stopped but he was a ""democrat"" and thought the public deserved to be asked if the final deal was what they wanted.He also claimed the public mood was shifting in favour of another referendum.""I wouldn't say there was an avalanche yet,"" he told John Pienaar.""One march alone isn't going to change the politics of the country... but I believe we are starting to see movement."""

The prime minister should also reserve the right to ""take with it the £39bn it has offered to pay as part of a divorce settlement"", it says.Signatories urge the government to accelerate plans to operate under World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules.Downing Street said it was confident the UK would get a good deal.Former cabinet ministers, economists and business figures including former chancellor Nigel Lawson, vocal Brexiteer John Redwood, and Wetherspoon chairman Tim Martin signed the letter.It was organised by Economists for Free Trade (EFT) and asks Mrs May to warn the EU that despite its ""intransigent and punitive stance"" Brexit cannot be stopped. Please upgrade your browser""We believe you could also make clear that your preferred outcome is a free trade deal between Britain and the EU, an arrangement that is to the mutual benefit of both parties,"" the letter says.It goes on to say that even though a free deal trade is ""eminently possible"", it believed it was ""time"" to move to a World Trade Deal under WTO rules ""in light of the reluctance of the EU swiftly to secure a free trade deal"".Britain is due to leave on 29 March 2019, 46 years after it first joined the European Economic Community, the forerunner to the EU.BBC political correspondent Ben Wright says the letter is ""a sign of how frustrated hardline Brexiteers are becoming"". He adds: ""The letter shows how intense the pressure is for Mrs May not to compromise, from some in her own party."" The UK wants to negotiate a ""comprehensive, bold and ambitious"" free trade agreement with the EU.If it can't achieve that, there are a number of other possible arrangements of varying depth before the UK reaches the point where it has no preferential trade relationship with the EU other than common membership of the WTO.If the UK had to trade under WTO rules, tariffs - a tax on traded goods - would be applied to all UK exports.The average WTO tariff varies from product to product, from 0% on mineral fuels and pharmaceuticals, to around 20-35% on processed food and 45-50% on meat.Reality Check: Does the UK trade with 'the rest of world' on WTO rules?The warning from well-known Brexit supporters comes after tens of thousands of people marched in central London, demanding a final vote on any UK exit deal..On Friday, plane-maker Airbus - which employs 14,000 people in Britain - said it could leave the UK if it exits the single market and customs union with no transition deal.Car maker BMW also warned that clarity is needed on a trade deal by the end of the summer, potentially affecting the company's 8,000-strong staff in the UK. In the letter, EFT says Britain can ""flourish, even without a free trade deal, because of benefits of leaving the EU"".""This would give the chancellor ample scope to increase spending on priority public services such as the NHS, while reducing the too high UK tax burden.""Earlier this week, Theresa May said a so-called Brexit dividend could be used to fund part of an extra £20bn a year for the health service.Although the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) calculates the UK will begin saving £3bn a year by 2020, this does not take into account Britain's expected £39bn divorce bill for exiting the EU.When asked about the EFT's letter, a Downing Street source said: ""We are confident of getting a good deal that delivers for every part of the UK and allows us to take back control of our money, rules and borders."""

Official advice recommends children should do 60 minutes of activity per day.The measures, which will open for consultation by the end of the year, include:Mr Hunt told the BBC that under the proposals all the big restaurant chains would have to provide calorie labelling, but there could be possible exemptions for smaller businesses. He said the cost of obesity was too great to ignore.""Parents are asking for help - we know that over three quarters of parents find offers for sugary sweets and snacks at checkouts annoying. ""It's our job to give power to parents to make healthier choices, and to make their life easier in doing so.""Halving childhood obesity in England in the next 12 years would mean 700,000 fewer children being obese by 2030, the government said.Prof Dame Sally Davies, chief medical officer for England, called the plan ""strong, robust and bold"" while Public Health England said the steps announced would help ""turn the tide"" on the obesity epidemic.Prof Russell Viner, from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health said the measures would ""help all families to make healthy choices and make a real difference in the lives of children and young people"".Tim Elwell-Sutton, assistant director at the Health Foundation, said it was a ""positive step forward"" but ""we await to see how these ideas will be turned into action"", while Caroline Cerny, of the Obesity Health Alliance, urged ""swift action"" to ""make these commitments a reality"". The British Retail Consortium said retailers were ""fully committed"" to the health of their customers.Some supermarkets, including Tesco, Aldi and Waitrose, have already stopped selling sweets and chocolate at checkouts.Scotland's First Minister set a target to cut child obesity by half by 2030 in May.Scotland's Public Health Minister, Aileen Campbell, said the government would be setting out its diet and healthy weight delivery plan ""very soon"", adding that it had been ""clear in its intention"" to tackle price promotions on junk food.A sugar tax on manufacturers who sell high-sugar drinks came into force in April in the UK.It means some drinks have increased in price while other brands have cut the sugar content of their drinks to avoid the levy.The tax currently doesn't cover flavoured milk drinks but it could in the future.The jury is still out on whether the tax will have the intended effect of putting people off buying and consuming sugary soft drinks, which are thought to be the biggest contributor to obesity.Public Health England has also started a programme challenging manufacturers to reduce sugar content in products like cakes, biscuits and cereals by 20% over the next four years.The UK has one of the highest proportions of overweight and obese children in the EU.In England, 22% of children are overweight or obese when they start school at the age of four or five, increasing to 34% during their time at primary school.Recent figures show that one in 25 children aged 10 or 11 is severely obese.Children are measured in different ways and at different ages across the UK.In Wales, 26% of children aged four to five are overweight or obese, and in Scotland 14% of under-16s are at risk of obesity.Childhood obesity is a worldwide problem, but it's estimated to cost the UK economy £27bn a year, and the NHS around £5bn, in treating illnesses related to the issue, such as type 2 diabetes and some types of cancer."

The protest is part of a ""summer of action"" by campaign groups designed to increase pressure on Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn.The organisers have said that at least 100,000 people attended the march.World War Two veteran Stephen Goodall, 96, led the pro-EU protesters as they headed from Pall Mall to Parliament Square.There were boos from the crowd as the march approached Downing Street. After showing anger towards the PM, some began to chant ""where's Jeremy Corbyn?""Among those addressing the demonstrators was Gina Miller, who successfully campaigned to ensure the UK could not trigger talks on leaving without the approval of Parliament.She said: ""Together we must stand up, demand our voices are heard, demand a people's vote so that future generations can hear us say we did our bit we stood up and shouted for a country that's together, kinder, tolerant. ""This is not a time to be silent.""Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said Brexit was ""not a done deal"" and could be reversed, while Green Party co-leader Caroline Lucas told the crowd that Brexit ""will be a disaster for this country"".One of the rally organisers, James McGrory from pressure group Open Britain, said there should be ""a choice between leaving with the deal that the government negotiates, or staying in the European Union"".Britain is due to leave on 29 March 2019, 46 years after it first joined the European Economic Community, the forerunner to the EU. The government is giving Parliament a vote on the final deal, if one is reached, in the autumn - but it remains unclear what will happen if they reject it.

A lot of companies are leaving, so there is going to be an effect on jobs.""I'm a German teacher and I'm worried the attitude of Brexit will make it harder to learn languages here. If it goes through, we may leave.""Janet Watts, 61, from Suffolk, said she joined the march for her mother - who is from Denmark and arrived in Britain in 1953.""She had her passport stamped when she got off the boat at Harwich, telling her she could stay,"" she said. ""That has been the same until this referendum happened.""I think it is disgusting putting families at risk and putting her through this at the age of 83.""But Shazia Hobbs, who attended the pro-Brexit UK Unity and Freedom march, said: ""That march is silly. We voted to leave so we should leave.""What do they want, best of three? We voted for Brexit.""Demonstrators also chanted ""we want our country back"" and: ""What do we want? Brexit. When do we want it? Now.""Conservative MP Peter Bone - who supports Brexit - said if there were a second vote, the leave campaign would win again.""The vast, vast majority of people, whether they are Leavers or Remainers, just want us to get on and come out this dreadful European Union super-state,"" he said.""There were 17.4 million people that voted for leave and if there are a few thousand in London complaining about it - that doesn't seem to really make much difference."""

Michael Russell said the Scottish government no longer trusted UK ministers after they pushed through the Brexit bill last week.He was speaking as Nicola Sturgeon arrived in Guernsey for talks with UK Cabinet Minister David Lidington.Mr Lidington said governments should ""co-operate on the big issues"".He insisted the UK government was committed to maintaining a good working relationship with the devolved administrations despite the ""inevitable political noise"" over Brexit.And he urged the Scottish government ""to maintain their own side of that relationship"".Relations between the two governments are said to be at their lowest ever level after the Commons last week spent less than 20 minutes debating the EU Withdrawal Bill's impact on devolution, despite the Scottish Parliament voting to withhold consent. Ms Sturgeon has accused the UK government of ""ripping up"" the devolution settlement.The first minister also said she was ""proud"" of SNP MPs who walked out of Prime Minister's Questions in protest over the UK government's handling of the bill - a move that was derided as a ""pre-arranged stunt"" by opponents. Senior SNP and Scottish government figures have said the protest was not a one-off, and it would not be ""business as usual"" for devolution.Speaking to the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme, Mr Russell said he ""couldn't conceive of circumstances"" where MSPs would vote to give approval for further UK legislation related to leaving the EU, such as trade, agriculture and fisheries.He added: ""We are absolutely clear that the way that devolution operates and the structures of devolution have failed, and they failed because the UK government is refusing to operate them.""For example, on the Sewel Convention, we need to have the interpretation of that written down in statute and made legally binding, because what we've presently got is a situation where the UK government makes the rules and then breaks them themselves, and there are no sanctions.""He said that, while there was ""practical work"" to do to prepare for Brexit, ""it is very difficult to do that work because, frankly, we don't trust the UK government with it"".Ms Sturgeon and Mr Lidington are at a meeting of the British-Irish Council in Guernsey, which is also being attended by Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones and representatives from Guernsey, Jersey and the Isle of Man.Ahead of the meeting, Ms Sturgeon and Mr Jones issued a joint statement in which they repeated their call for the UK to remain in the single market and customs union after Brexit - which has already been ruled out by Prime Minister Theresa May. Airbus announced on Friday morning that it could leave the UK if the country exits the European Union single market and customs union without a transition deal.Mr Russell said the announcement was further evidence of the ""carnage"" in terms of jobs and the economy that Brexit could bring. The EU Withdrawal has been at the centre of a long-running row between Edinburgh and London, and has been pushed through by the UK government despite MSPs at Holyrood refusing to grant consent.It is the first time this has happened since the Scottish Parliament was created in 1999.Please upgrade your browserMr Lidington said voters expected the governments across the UK to work together and highlighted how Scotland had voted to remain part of the UK.He said: ""Working together is exactly what people all across the UK want to see their respective governments doing.""They want to see their lives being improved through joint endeavour. They don't expect different governments - with politicians from different parties - to agree on everything.""But they do expect us to keep talking - and listening - to each other, and to co-operate on the big issues that affect us all.""The UK government is committed to ""not normally"" passing laws that impact on devolved powers under something known as the Sewel Convention.But it argues that Brexit means these are not ""normal"" times, and that it needed to act despite not having Holyrood consent in order to allow a smooth transition after the UK leaves the EU.The row over the Brexit bill centres on 153 powers in what are now devolved areas, but which were sent to Brussels when the UK joined the EU in 1973. Westminster effectively wants to keep ""temporary"" control of 24 of these powers when they return to the UK after Brexit, with the remainder of the 153 going directly to the Scottish Parliament.It says having control in key areas such as farming and food labelling for the first few years after Brexit will ensure the same rules continue to be followed across the UK.The Scottish government wants all of the powers straight away - although it agrees that UK-wide rules and regulations are needed - and has repeatedly accused the UK government of a ""power grab""."

The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019.By Simon Jack, BBC business editorIt has been a source of exasperation for some cabinet members that although many companies have privately expressed concern - even alarm - at the progress of the Brexit negotiations, they have been reluctant to make their fears public, and have even dialled down the shrillness of their warnings when meeting the prime minister in person. Airbus's decision to warn that future investment in their operations in the UK is under review, while not exactly welcome, is therefore considered by some in government as an honest and helpful declaration of what's at stake for UK workers and the wider economy. Prominent Brexit supporter Sir Bernard Jenkin described Airbus's comments as the kind of ""speculation"" seen before, during and after the referendum from large companies.But Airbus's UK boss, Katherine Bennett, told the BBC: ""This is not project fear, this is dawning reality.""Mr Robertson said he needed to know what the government's preferred position was on customs and trade within months or his company - and the UK's - competitive position could be harmed.""If we don't get clarity in the next couple of months we have to start making those contingency plans...  which means making the UK less competitive than it is in a very competitive world right now,"" he said.""That is a decisive issue that ultimately could damage this industry.""BMW has previously warned about the damage of Brexit uncertainty, and in May chief executive Harald Krueger said the company had to remain ""flexible"" about production facilities.The company has built up an alternative manufacturing base in the Netherlands amid concerns about Britain's suitability as an export hub after Brexit.Airbus, in its Brexit ""risk assessment"" published on Thursday, said if the UK left the EU next year without a deal - meaning it left both the single market and customs union immediately and without any agreed transition - it would ""lead to severe disruption and interruption of UK production"".The European plane-maker said the warning was not part of ""project fear"", but was a ""dawning reality"".Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said any warning from any major company was taken seriously, but stressed that ""we genuinely expect to have a sensible partnership"" with the EU that was mutually beneficial.He said there had been a large number of investment announcements in the UK over the last 18 months.Security minister Ben Wallace stressed in a tweet the importance of UK military contracts to the plane-maker.When I last checked if it wasn’t for the customer countries of the A400m , Airbus would have not been able to cover the over budget and delays.

2018-06-24,£2.4m spent on Commons gagging clauses,https://web.archive.org//web/20180624151850/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44571120,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe House of Commons spent £2.4m on ""gagging clauses"" for former staff since 2013, BBC Newsnight has learned.Fifty-three departing members of the House of Commons Service signed contracts compelling them not to reveal information about the Commons.So-called ""non-disclosure agreements"" (NDAs) can be used to silence victims of bullying or harassment.A House spokesman said the clauses were used ""to resolve employment disputes under certain circumstances"".Newsnight uncovered the information via a Freedom of Information Act request, which was made as part of its investigation into bullying and harassment by MPs of members of the House of Commons Service - the apolitical employees who run the Commons and its committees. These people are usually referred to in Westminster as ""clerks"".Newsnight has previously reported that Angus Sinclair, formerly the Speaker's secretary, was paid £86,000 - more than a year of pay - as part of a settlement that entailed him signing a non-disclosure agreement. He felt he was being paid off to stay quiet about being bullied by the Speaker of the House of Commons (an allegation that the Speaker denies). The answer to the request reveals that £2.4m was spent on 53 settlements including gagging clauses with departing staff members since 2013. (The Press Association has, by the same means, got the same information which they are publishing independently.) The average settlement cost £45,418.Jill Rutter of the Institute for Government, said: ""The public sector should not be allowed to waste taxpayers' money on NDAs"". She said it was ""impossible to justify as [value for money]"".These figures are a slight underestimate. There may also be some other cases in 2012 and 2018, but the numbers involved are small enough that they fear publishing them would allow people to figure out information about identifiable individuals. The House of Commons reply to Newsnight clarifies that the NDAs were ""settlement agreements (formerly known as compromise agreements) which include a confidentiality clause"". It is unclear how many of these contracts were signed, as Mr Sinclair believes was the case for him, in order to prevent information about bullying or harassment leaking out.Newsnight has established, however, that confidentiality clauses were not standard in House of Commons exit deals: the annual report for the financial year 2016-17 shows 43 people left the House on ""exit packages"", but only 23 were given NDAs in all of 2016 and 2017.  We also know that people, known to Newsnight, who had made complaints about sexual harassment or bullying at the House were asked to sign NDAs when they left with an exit deal. Some other NDAs, however, were really a means of getting rid of a staff member more easily. Getting them to sign a non-disclosure agreement could be used as a justification for a bigger pay-off. Gagging clauses are sometimes suggested by unions to get more money out of employers for a departing member of staff. So while some of these NDAs may have been intended to keep the culture under wraps, it is not clear how many that applies to. The House of Commons, however, is now likely to face questions about its use of NDAs. The House of Commons does not have trade secrets, for example, that might justify the use of gagging clauses. Maria Miller, chair of the women and equalities committee, which is researching the use of NDAs, said: ""There needs to be more transparency on why payments such as this are being made in the first place.""

The marine environment is listed as the main topic for discussion, but Brexit was also discussed ahead of next week's EU summit in Brussels.Mr Varadkar said: ""We have made some good progress to date and I think it will be possible to come to a withdrawal agreement that works for everyone.""But we also need to be prepared for the possibility that that will not happen.""All EU countries will be stepping up preparations for all possible scenarios, including a no-deal Brexit.""It is the the fourth time the summit has been held in Guernsey.Mr Varadkar held bilateral discussions with Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones.British Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington also attended.Gareth Gordon, BBC NI political correspondentThe British Irish Council was set up under the Good Friday Agreement. Its sister organisation was the North-South Ministerial Council, which was made up of ministers from the Northern Ireland Executive and ministers from the Irish government. For obvious reasons, that has not met since just before the collapse of Stormont. Once again, the Northern Ireland parties will be absent at the British Irish Council due to the collapse of Stormont.The main topic for discussion is meant to be the marine environment, but Brexit is bound to loom large, especially ahead of of next week's EU summit in Brussels. The taoiseach did not make the summit dinner last night because had business in Dublin with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker. Instead, he flew in this morning. Mr Varadkar reiterated yesterday that Ireland expects Britain to honour its commitments and have no hard border.The Irish government issued a statement last night saying Mr Varadkar's meetings with the Scottish first minister and Welsh first minister will focus on the implications of Brexit. The council will also talk about the political situation in Northern Ireland and Mr Varadkar is expected to reiterate his regret that no Northern Ireland ministers are at the British-Irish Council summit. The meeting coincides with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker's two-day visit to Ireland.On Thursday, Mr Junker said that Ireland is not alone in Brexit negotiations and will remain backed by all member states.""This is not a bilateral question between Ireland the United Kingdom - this is an issue between the UK and the European Union,"" he said.""We want to make it clear again and again that Ireland is not alone.""We have Ireland backed by 26 member states and the commission - this will not change.""I am strongly against any temptation to isolate Ireland and not to conclude the deal on Ireland.""Ireland has to be part of the deal.""On Friday, he will also meet Irish President Michael D Higgins and visit the home of the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA), Croke Park, and the GAA museum.He will also watch a demonstration of Gaelic football and hurling."
2018-06-24,Watchdog expected to find Vote Leave broke rules,https://web.archive.org//web/20180624151850/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44567588,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAn investigation into whether the official Leave campaign in the EU Referendum broke electoral rules is scheduled to be published within weeks. The draft Electoral Commission's report concludes that Vote Leave and another smaller campaign group did break the rules, the BBC understands, and is expected to recommend at least one fine.  The latest investigation comes after allegations were made by the whistleblowers Christopher Wylie and Shahmir Sanni that the official Brexit campaign broke the law by colluding with a smaller group, BeLeave. It is understood that the commission did consider this new evidence, but it is not thought that the new information was decisive in proving a breach of the law. This is the first full formal investigation into Vote Leave, although the Electoral Commission had twice examined the campaign's behaviour. One source said that the draft report was ""bizarre"" and had ""gone way off track"" by focusing on the original information that has already been pored over, rather than additional evidence. It's suggested that the commission did not interview, nor request interviews, with the senior members of the Vote Leave Campaign team. Lawyers for those criticised in the report are understood to be challenging the draft findings, and publication could therefore be subject to delay. It is not clear if the commission plans only to recommend civil sanctions like fines, or also suggest referring the matter to the police or Crown Prosecution Service. Suggestions that the official Leave campaign, which featured senior Cabinet ministers, broke the law, would be highly controversial. Vote Leave and BeLeave have both always denied the allegations. An Electoral Commission spokesperson said: ""In accordance with its Enforcement Policy, the Electoral Commission has written to Vote Leave, Mr Darren Grimes and Veterans for Britain to advise each campaigner of the outcome of the investigation announced on 20 November 2017. ""The campaigners have 28 days to make representations before final decisions are taken. ""The commission will announce the outcome of the investigation and publish an investigation report once this final decision has been taken.""  Lawyer Tamsin Allen, who acts for Mr Sanni, Mr Wylie and a third whistleblower, said ""The legal opinion and evidence submitted to the EC demonstrated the grounds for suspecting that Vote Leave and BeLeave conducted an unlawful spending scheme.  ""If the Electoral Commission has indeed found those in the scheme guilty of  electoral offences, this is vindication for the whistleblowers, but a serious blow for the public and for the integrity of the referendum vote."""

But the 69-year-old decided to travel from South Normanton in Derbyshire to call for a ""People's Vote"".""I'm hoping it's not too late, but we have got to take the chance for goodness sake,"" she said.""These crowds of people make me emotional. I've seen signs about futures being stolen and it brings tears to my eyes. I want to march and I want a vote.""Her husband, John Pearce, carried a placard saying ""grumpy old Brits"". ""The first referendum was won on spurious information from both sides,"" he said. ""Now we know a lot more, I think people have changed their minds, both ways, and deserve a chance to vote.""Cinzia Sangiovanni has lived in the UK for 19 years, and lives in south London with her British husband and two children.The whole family took part in the march, as three of them hold Italian passports - and she fears for their future without a say on the deal. ""I want to march because I feel my rights are under threat,"" she said.""If I was told to, I wouldn't be able to just turn around and go back to Italy. I just worry for the future.""Among the sea of EU flags was Erika Gallacher, who moved from Carlisle to London 11 years ago.""I have friends who voted a different way to me, but I also have a lot of friends from the EU,"" she said.""I work for a university and I'm worried about the students and what will happen to them. ""But for me, I also worry about my future, starting a family and bringing up children. I cannot see any good to it for them.""Leo Buckley was prominent at the head of the march with his placard, reading: ""Brexit has stolen my future.""The 16-year-old from Hampshire said: ""I think my placard says it all.""It is stealing it economically - we have already seen the drop in the pound and the loss of jobs - so I will struggle to find employment and be worse off when I do. ""And also socially - look at the rise in hate crime and xenophobia. I don't want Brexit to become the poster boy of a return to attitudes from the 1930s.""A group calling themselves the ""Suffolk EU Alliance"" were also out in force carrying placards and plastered in stickers stating their cause. Christine Speer was one of them - originally from Canada, but a British citizen for 50 years who considers herself a ""citizen of nowhere"". ""The EU has its problems, but there are a number of problems at the time of the referendum that weren't because of the EU - the government was responsible,"" she said. ""Some people who voted for Brexit will actually find they are worse off. ""Ideally it would be better if Brexit didn't happen, but if it does, the public needs to have a say.""Dr Horst-Dieter Haas proudly carried his German flag as he attended the march. He married a British woman, but the pair spent 30 years in his home country, bringing up their children, before moving to the UK. He has been working in the NHS since 2005, but says he will quit if Brexit goes ahead. He added: ""It is already impacting the NHS. We haven't got enough doctors, nurses, physiotherapists, we don't even have enough money, and that will all be worse if Brexit happens. ""The NHS is not performing and there are too many lies about the benefits. I will definitely be stopping if we leave.""But as the pro-EU protest reached its rally point in Parliament Square, another was heading in the same direction. The UK Unity and Freedom march said it was focusing on ""freedom from the EU, freedom from terror, freedom of speech, freedom from Sharia law, and unity of all people, irrespective of race or creed"".The pro-Brexit march was significantly smaller, but their voices rang out as they walked along Millbank, with supporters chanting for ""our country back"" and singing Rule, Britannia!Shazia Hobbs, who was speaking at the event, criticised those on the opposing protest. ""That march is silly,"" she said. ""We voted to leave so we should leave. ""What do they want, best of three? We voted for Brexit.""One woman, who didn't want to be named, had travelled from Brighton to join the march.She said: ""I'm on this march because I am a patriot. The EU is an undemocratic and authoritarian establishment. We need to be a self-governing nation.""And a man, who also did not want to be named, added: ""I don't like big government. That is what the EU is."" Whether either protest will impact the government's next steps is yet to be seen. "
2018-06-24,Most effective minister?,https://web.archive.org//web/20180624151850/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44565750,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowMichael Gove. Just the mention of his name on comedy shows elicits guffaws and groans. He's become a figure of hate among teachers, parents and children, and a figure of fun among voters as a whole. Yet talk to people in and around Westminster and a completely different man emerges. Whether they agree or disagree with his policies, they are united in their judgement: Gove has been the most effective minister of recent years.Most ministers, when they finally reach office, are surprised to find that when they pull on the levers of power very little happens. Gove seems to have learned how to fix the cogs and pulleys so that a tug at one end produces a tangible result at the other.Even his die-hard opponents can't deny that he has been effective. Mary Bousted is joint general secretary of the National Education Union, representing teachers. During his education reforms, she was one of Gove's greatest adversaries. ""Within 77 days of the 2010 general election he'd got the Education Reform Act through Parliament,"" she says.""The pace of change which he promoted was extraordinary. The problem with that, of course, is there are unforeseen and unintended consequences and casualties all over the place, which in recent years have very much tarnished his reforming reputation.""That's something you hear about Gove's education reforms from some critics. Other people praise the way he's introduced more rigour into exams and given schools more freedom. But the BBC Radio 4 programme I've made, Gove in Government, isn't about whether his policies are right or wrong.  And nor is it about his views on Brexit, his fallout with Boris Johnson, or his blundering bid for the Tory leadership. It is about Gove, the departmental minister. So how has he managed to be so effective, in three different government departments? Camilla Cavendish was head of the policy unit at No 10 when he was Lord Chancellor, running the Ministry of Justice. She told me: ""He had a laser-like focus about what he wanted to achieve and he was bloody minded about getting there. ""What I've observed from being in government is that unless you have those things as a cabinet minister, it's incredibly difficult to get anything done.""As well as a focus, though, Gove realised that he had to attract the right people into his private office: the junior to middle-ranking officials whose job it is to chase progress, demand improvements and often tell more senior civil servants that their work isn't good enough. This requires a degree of character and courage. Pamela Dow, his principal private secretary at Education who followed him to Justice, says it's inspiring to work for a minister who knows his mind and wants to change things. ""The fast-streamers would not normally have been excited to work at Defra, whereas now people really are, because it's nice to see the policy you're working on being talked about. Whether you're a supporter or not, no-one can deny that in every department he's gone to, he's had a radical vision, made waves about it and made a tangible difference."" Defra, of course, is the Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, usually rather a backwater in government. But Gove has transformed it. Outside Brexit, the main policy everyone's been talking about in the past few months has been how to reduce the amount of plastic we use. And that is an initiative Gove has been championing, after the scale of the problem was highlighted by TV series Blue Planet II.He likes to see himself as a revolutionary. On the walls of his office are posters of Lenin, Martin Luther King and Malcolm X - not the natural heroes of a Conservative politician. Early on in his ministerial career, he was perhaps too keen to make enemies of the establishment - which is why teachers took against him. In his later years, he has learnt his lesson and become more emollient. People who work with him find him charming and unfailingly polite. He's been known to disappear to a bookshop and return with a carefully chosen book for each member of his private office. Even his enemies, though, are disarmed by his courtesy. Mary Bousted was astonished when he gave her a bottle of gin recently as a wedding present. Sir David Bell was Gove's first permanent secretary in the Department for Education, and wasn't a natural ideological ally. But he too has a respect for the man. ""Michael has a legendary politeness. He was very good with officials, he was open, he listened. He had a voracious appetite for reading and he was completely engaged with the agenda. ""That was something that impressed officials. Here was somebody who was absolutely on top of the brief and who was prepared to put the hours in. Michael was clearly up to it intellectually, and he worked enormously hard to drive his agenda.""His four-year run as education secretary came to an end in David Cameron's July 2014 reshuffle, when Mr Cameron was advised by his strategist Lynton Crosby to ""get the barnacles off the boat"" ahead of a general election.It was suggested at the time that Gove was seen as ""the king of the barnacles"" because he was so toxic with teachers.A lot of people hate Michael Gove for what he did in schools, for his support for Brexit, for the way he knifed Boris Johnson in the back. His bid for the party leadership was a disaster. So Gove the politician may not have been a great success. But I've been really struck, in making this programme, by the number of people who've worked with him and against him who have the same view of Gove the minister. Nearly 40 years ago, the Labour politician Gerald Kaufman wrote a book that's still in print, called How to be a Minister. Whatever the recent speculation, I think it's highly unlikely that Gove will end up at No 10. He's too unpopular with voters. But perhaps next time he gets sacked, he should spend his time out writing a sequel. It might become a bible for the next generation of aspiring ministers.Mary Ann Sieghart is a writer and broadcaster. She worked alongside Michael Gove when he was a columnist for The Times newspaper.Gove in Government, on BBC Radio 4, runs on Sunday 24 June and will be available to listen to online after the broadcast.

Maybe both sides did, a bit.Lots will be said and written in the next 24 hours about who really backed down after another day of shenanigans in Parliament - whips cornering potential rebels, even today, the grim sight of a Labour MP being forced to come to vote while visibly ill in a wheelchair and on morphine, the Tories so nervous about the vote that they suspended the normal rules that allow for ill MPs to stay out of the Chamber.As Westminster games go, it is getting pretty extreme. But ultimately, your view on whether the compromise had a winner, may depend on the side you are on.Both sides of course will claim they were the victor, the haggling over a deal took so long because both sides wanted to save face.The cabinet minister Liam Fox has just told us that nothing has really changed, it was just ""procedural"" and the fundamentals were exactly the same.In contrast, one of the organisers of the rebel group, Stephen Hammond, tweeted that the government has now conceded that Parliament would have a ""real say with no constraints"", if the final Brexit deal is rejected.The two sides will, guess what, continue to argue it for weeks to come, and every insult, every rankle, every cross word on this episode, being remembered in the difficult months to come.Here are two things however that are hard to dispute.The government was worried enough about losing today to budge, even if they only gave an inch.It might be a concession that only really parliamentary lawyers understand, but the PM had to move, again, despite not wanting to.And despite the fact that she did compromise even in a meaningless way (yes I can't believe that I did just write that sentence, but it is relevant), the vote was still relatively close, certainly not comfortable enough for the government to relax any time soon. What's also the case is that the Tory rebels, or potential rebels more like, weren't willing to take dramatic action in enough number to humiliate the PM.The vote result suggests that they have the hypothetical numbers, but their critics, and their internal opponents in the Tory party would question if they really have the guts.The former boss of the Treasury, Nick McPherson, no fan of Brexit it's important to say, has just acidly written online: ""Axiom of the last 30 years. Europhile Tories always compromise to preserve party unity, Their opponents don't. #thatswhywearewhereweare""But the last 24 hours has also been frustrating for Brexiteers.Many of them believe that Theresa May didn't have to push it this far, that she could have faced down the potential rebels without having to give any ground.There are many behind the scenes urging Number 10 to take a firmer line, to dare them to vote against her.Not the Parliamentary arithmetic, but the Tories' own arithmetic, makes them believe that she'd be easily able to do so, to end it once and for all and make plain that Brexiteers are the dominant force.But to face down the rebels who want to maintain closer ties to the EU or the Brexiteers would require the prime minister to risk something that she wants to avoid - to make the splits in Tory party more exposed, to make one side of the party the overt winner. For many months she has survived by tacking first an inch one way, and then the other.Today's events with a non-compromise-compromise suggest she is simply not ready to abandon that approach.But with so many more difficult decisions to come in the next few months, on both sides, Tories are more and more frustrated that she refuses to choose.One observes that Number 10 might believe the ""lesson of Maastricht"", is to try everything to keep the Tory party together, but the truth they suggest is that the real lesson of Maastricht is that any war is only over when one side is the clear victor.The trouble is, another source suggested, she never wants to say no to anyone, but when it comes to doing this deal, she simply can't say yes to everyone."
2018-06-24,Stay or go?,https://web.archive.org//web/20180624151850/https://www.bbc.com/news/education-44456240,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowEmilia Wilton-Godberfforde is facing a big decision - will she continue working as an academic in UK universities after Brexit?She is British but her husband is French and they are worried about the uncertainty of their future status and what she calls rising ""xenophobia"".They also fear a loss of EU research funding will threaten university jobs.The universities minister says UK access to EU research budgets will ""remain unchanged"" until at least 2020.There are about 36,000 academics from European Union countries working in UK universities - and there are others such as Ms Wilton-Godberfforde who have family links to European researchers and academics.EU nationals are about 17% of the UK's academics - and since the referendum there have been brain drain warnings from universities.Margaret Gardner, vice-chancellor of Monash University, in Australia, recently said Australian universities were already poaching academics from the UK.But so far the evidence doesn't show an academic stampede. Instead, it suggests a picture of ""wait and see"".""We're nervous. Nothing is made clear about our status. It's promises and half-promises,"" says Ms Wilton-Godberfforde, who has been a research fellow at the University of Cambridge and is teaching French language and literature for the Open University.Her husband is a French, Cambridge-educated scientist and they have a young child - and the family is struggling with a sense that Brexit has made them feel ""unwelcome"".""It doesn't feel like home,"" she says.It's a conversation she says is running through universities - with European staff choosing whether to put down roots or to move away.If Ms Wilton-Godberfforde and her husband choose to stay in the UK, she doesn't know what type of bureaucracy and uncertainty will surround their new status. And she is ""massively upset"" at the sense that things are going backwards for her generation - and that barriers are being put up to her mobility.""It feels like everything is shrinking, we're penalised for looking outwards,"" she says.By contrast, Cambridge professor Robert Tombs is pro-Brexit and rejects the link between leaving the EU and xenophobia.""Britain is not a xenophobic country,"" he says in a podcast for a group putting the views of pro-Brexit academics.""Race relations are much better than in most European countries which are solidly in support of the EU.""There's no simple co-relation between disliking foreigners and not liking the EU."" There are, however, also job worries over Brexit and EU research funding.And Dr Wilton-Godberfforde says she worries about academics ""grappling for grants that no longer exist"".The Universities Minister, Sam Gyimah this week gave assurances that UK universities would have the full benefits of the current research round, even though it stretches beyond the UK's departure date from the EU.Even if there was no deal, the UK government had promised to underwrite any commitments, he said, answering an MP's question.""This guarantees funding for UK participants in projects ongoing at the point of exit,"" said Mr Gyimah.But there is even more EU research money at stake from 2021 - about 100bn euros in the next round - and so far not much clarity about the UK's access to this.The UK's universities, highly rated by international standards, have been among the biggest winners of EU funding, net beneficiaries by about 3.4bn euros in the most recent round.And they would have hoped to get a big slice of the next pot of research cash, but that is now uncertain.It's possible for non-EU countries to participate by paying for associate status. But that would also mean a loss of voting rights and giving up control over how the money is allocated.Universities UK are so far optimistic - saying that it's mutually advantageous for the EU to have access to top UK university researchers.But Ludovic Highman, at the Centre for Global Higher Education, at University College London, warns that it is ""not a given"".The decision will depend on the final Brexit negotiations.Will EU students stop coming to UK universities?There are about 135,000 EU students in UK universities - and their future status is more ""wait and see"".It depends on a reciprocal deal over the status of EU students in UK universities and UK students in the EU.This will determine whether UK students can carry on not paying tuition fees in Holland and whether EU students will continue to head for the sought-after universities in the UK.If, on the other hand, they become fully fledged ""overseas"" students, it will mean much higher fees.EU students are highest in number in Russell Group universities, in London - and, with the lack of tuition fees, in Scotland.Top 10 UK universities with the highest proportion of EU studentsIn overall numbers, UCL has the most EU students, almost 4,500. But the highest proportion, over 19%, is at the University of Aberdeen.On short-term exchanges, such as under the Erasmus scheme, it seems increasingly likely that the UK will continue to participate, paying to have associate status.There has been a spate of announcements of close partnerships between UK universities and European counterparts.But Imperial College London has gone a step further.The leading science institution has an arrangement with a French government research body that will give UK academics access to EU funding after Brexit.The Unite Mixte Internationale (UMI) Abraham de Moivre has been created as a maths laboratory in London, in partnership with France's National Centre for Scientific Research.This is the first time that the French government has co-funded such a research unit in the UK - and from the French perspective, this new centre in London will have the same status as a laboratory in France.For Imperial, it means staff at the new maths research unit will have equal access to funding, regardless of their nationality."
2018-06-24,Will there be a 'Brexit dividend'?,https://web.archive.org//web/20180624151850/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44523513,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe claim: Extra funding for the NHS, up to 2023, will be part-funded by a Brexit dividend.Reality Check verdict: Once the UK stops paying into the EU budget, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) says there will be savings. But this doesn't take into account the extra spending associated with leaving the EU and the potential economic impact, as forecast by the OBR.The debate over how to fund the NHS dominated the main exchanges during Wednesday's Prime Minister's Questions, with the subject of the ""Brexit dividend"" being brought up.The government says a combination of tax rises, economic growth and a ""Brexit dividend"" will help cover the costs of the increased spending in England's NHS budget.Under the plans, the NHS annual budget will increase by £20.5bn by 2023. On top of that, about £4bn will be given to the rest of the UK - although it will be up to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to decide how that is spent.So is the UK government right to claim that we can expect a ""dividend"" by leaving the European Union? When the government talks about a ""dividend"", it is referring to the annual contribution that we pay towards the European Union budget every year.According to the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) - the independent body that scrutinises the public finances - the UK contributed just under £9bn net to the EU budget in 2016-17.Under the government's current plans, the UK will remain a member of the EU until 29 March 2019 and it will continue to pay into the EU budget until then.After that there is a proposed transition period in order to give more time to negotiate a post-Brexit relationship with the EU. The transition is scheduled to last until the end of December 2020.The amount we pay during the transition period is expected to be similar to last year's net contribution.The OBR has set out what the potential savings might be. It believes the UK will start saving money from 2020, £3bn initially and rising to £5.8bn a year in 2022-23.That's based on how much we would have contributed to the EU budget, less the financial settlement or ""divorce"" bill.But it's not as simple as that.For one, while the OBR will have made some working assumptions about size of the ""divorce"" settlement, we still don't know what the final bill will be. The latest UK estimate for the total is cost is between £35bn and £39bn. This is based on calculations the UK and EU have agreed, not the final amount on which the two sides have settled.  In April the National Audit Office said that the final bill remains uncertain and much of it depends on future events. For some parts, like pensions, the UK would end up paying for decades.But the government has already committed to pay for certain things associated with the cost of leaving the EU.Last autumn the Chancellor Philip Hammond announced £3bn of funding over the next two years to help government departments prepare for Brexit.Furthermore, a significant amount of the money the UK currently contributes to the EU ends up coming back to the UK to fund things like agricultural subsidies and science and research funding.The government has said it will preserve the funding that farmers currently receive from the EU - at least until 2022. In 2017, that was worth just over £3bn.The UK also has to decide, among other things, if it will replace EU programmes that fund development in poor UK regions as well as research and development grants.On top of all this, there's also considerable uncertainty about how the economy will perform after Brexit. According to the OBR, the saving we get from no longer paying into the EU budget will be outweighed if the economy underperforms.It says that the impact of Brexit on the public finances will be largely determined by what happens to future tax revenues, which are linked to the strength of the economy.And the OBR is already forecasting extra borrowing of about £15bn a year because the UK voted to leave the EU from 2018-19 to 2020-21.It puts this down to things like lower immigration, lower productivity and higher inflation.The government has been disputing whether the economy will take a hit. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Monday: ""A lot of the forecasts have been wrong and in fact the British economy has been... a lot more resilient than many people were forecasting."" But he did not dispute that the economy has been slowing. Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questionsFollow us on Twitter"
2018-06-24,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20180624151850/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks  are now focusing on the detail of those issues and on future relations - after agreement was reached on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree within six months on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide, but first let's go back to the basics...It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.1% in the first three months of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.4%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand near a 40-year year low of 4.2%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 4.2% in the year to March 2018, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues. The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May was now put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. It will end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain-supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each playing roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanAn agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pounds buy fewer euros. A slump in the value of the dollar means the exchange rate with the pound is pretty close to where it was before the referendum.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.The UK has proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.A method for calculating the bill has been agreed, but the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more.The question of how and when payments will be made still needs to resolved, but it will be a schedule lasting for many years to come, and it is highly unlikely that anyone will ever be able to give an exact figure for the size of the divorce bill.UK sources say it will be up to £40bn, but some EU sources expect it to be higher than that. No-one can say for sure, and both sides want to keep it that way.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn.

At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 6.5% in 2016 to 2.7% in 2017, according to the Halifax. It said the slowdown was driven by a squeeze on real wage growth.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-06-24,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180624151850/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to £840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

On the two previous occasions in 1970 and February 1974 the PM and the party lost office. While there is no other conceivable administration in the new parliament other than a Conservative-led one, it remains to be seen whether the PM will retain her position. However, so long as the Conservatives can reach an accommodation with the DUP they will have a working majority in the House of Commons.  BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed:When the general election exit poll was revealed at 10pm, the pound immediately dropped by 2% as investors took a position that a hung parliament was a possible outcome of the general election.Why would that cause the currency to decline?

It argued that without such investment the UK armed forces' usefulness to the US would be diminished. ""The government must not let this happen,"" the report says.BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale says the committee's report will ""add fuel to what seems to be an increasingly acrimonious row between the defence secretary, Gavin Williamson, and the Treasury and the prime minister"".He says there have been warnings of a Conservative backbench rebellion if more funding is not forthcoming.Over the weekend the Mail on Sunday reported that Mr Williamson threatened to end Theresa May's leadership if she did not provide more money. But Chief Secretary to the Treasury Liz Truss warned cabinet colleagues that it is ""not macho"" to demand more funding.Speaking at an event in London, she said the £20bn a year budget boost for the NHS announced by Theresa May last week was a ""one-off"" and would not be replicated elsewhere.""My point to my colleagues is that any additional spending will necessarily - most likely - lead to additional taxation and we should be honest when we have that discussion,"" she said. ""We need to keep tax as low as possible.""Amid calls for extra resources for the military, Lord Houghton - chief of defence staff between 2013 and 2016 - said ""it would be a great shame"" if the armed forces budget was used as part of a ""political game"".He told BBC Radio 4's Today the current defence plans were ""unaffordable"" and the UK needed to ""make a decision"" about ""what sort of country we aspire to be"".Lord Houghton said: ""The first duty of government is the protection of the nation. ""We have slightly deluded the public of late that we have a defence programme that frankly we know is unaffordable. ""We are to an extent living a lie."" The MPs' report also notes comments by US Defence Secretary James Mattis that the UK benefits from its defence relationship with the US by £3bn a year. ""This implies that both the UK armed forces and HM Treasury benefit from our close relationship with the US,"" the report says.""However, that will continue to be true only while the UK military retains both the capacity and capability to maintain interoperability with the US military and to relieve US burdens.""At next month's Nato summit in Brussels, US President Donald Trump is expected to repeat his demands for European allies to spend more on defence.Defence committee member Madeleine Moon, Labour MP for Bridgend, said the UK's armed forces have been ""hollowed out"" with the navy ""very weak"" and air capability ""diminished"".She told Today: ""Influence is really important because unless you can back it up with capability, you have no credibility.""Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morningA spokesman for the Ministry of Defence said: ""The UK maintains the biggest defence budget in Europe we have been clear we will continue to exceed Nato's 2% spending target.""The defence secretary launched the Modernising Defence Programme to strengthen our armed forces in the face of intensifying threats."""

Theresa May said it was right the government listened to business voices about the terms of the UK's exit.This story contains language some may find offensive.Airbus, BMW and Siemens have warned about the impact on their UK-based operations if the UK leaves the EU next March without any agreement.Their warnings have prompted different responses from ministers. Business Secretary Greg Clark has said the UK must ""take and act on the advice of business"" but Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said a warning from Airbus that it could cease operations entirely in the UK, threatening thousands of jobs, was ""completely inappropriate"".Asked about corporate concerns over a so-called hard Brexit, at an event for EU diplomats in London last week, Mr Johnson is reported to have replied: ""Fuck business."" Mr Johnson, who was reportedly speaking at the time to Rudolf Huygelen, Belgium's ambassador to the EU, was also overheard saying he and others would fight Theresa May's soft Brexit ""and win"".The foreign secretary, who was a key figure in the Leave campaign, was pressed on the issue in Parliament by Labour MP Owen Smith, who asked him if the comments were correct and, if so, whether they could be ""remotely justified"".""I don't think anybody could doubt the passionate support of this government for business,"" Mr Johnson said.""It may be that I have, from time to time, expressed scepticism about some of the views of those who profess to speak up for business.""Mr Johnson's comments about Brexit have frequently proved controversial. He was recorded telling Tory donors last month that the UK's strategy lacked ""guts"" and suggested US President Donald Trump could do a better job.The latest remark has angered some Tory MPs, with former Science Minister George Freeman telling BBC Radio 4's World at One programme that the reported comments were not ""helpful, responsible or statesmanlike"".The prime minister, who will travel to Brussels on Thursday for a summit of EU leaders, told a chief executives summit hosted by the Times she wanted business to be able to speak to the government. ""It's right that we listen to the voice of business,"" she said.""Business is at the heart of how we are going to develop this country,"" she said. ""We want to ensure we are listening to the business voice because business provides the backbone of our economy.""MPs who favour a clean break with the EU after Brexit, in March 29 2019, have called on Mrs May to walk away from negotiations if the EU does not show willingness to begin trade talks immediately."

We also want action to support states to address the chemical terrorism threat.""Mr Johnson said the OPCW was ""the right body to study who is behind an attack"".BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale said British diplomats had launched a huge effort to win enough support to win a vote on the issue on Wednesday.But Russia opposed the plan, which might see its Syrian allies face further international condemnation, he added.Syrian opposition activists, rescue workers and medics say more than 40 people were killed in a suspected chemical attack on the Syrian city of Douma in April.France said it had ""proof"" that ""chemical weapons were used - at least chlorine - and that they were used by Bashar al-Assad's regime"".The Syrian government denied the allegation. And its key ally Russia said it had ""irrefutable evidence"" that the incident had been ""staged"" with the help of the UK.Meanwhile, the UK says Russian ex-spy Sergei Skripal, 66, and his 33-year-old daughter, who were found slumped on a park bench in Salisbury on 4 March, were exposed to a nerve agent belonging to the Novichok group.This analysis was backed by the international chemical weapons watchdog.The attempted murder of the pair on British soil led to accusations of Russian state involvement. Russia has denied involvement in the attack.Yulia Skripal left hospital a month after the attack, and her father was discharged a month later.Alastair Hay, an expert on chemical weapons at Leeds University, said the UK was ""absolutely right"" to press for new powers.""Whether it happens and whether there are sufficient votes that the UK can garner to support the move is still an open question really,"" he told the BBC.""Of course you have the UK, the Unites States, France and many others who want the OPCW to have those powers.""But there are others who are very concerned about it. And that includes Russia and some of its allies. So, it's divided and it's a question of how many allies the UK can muster."""

She will be replaced by Jeane Freeman, with Keith Brown and Angela Constance also quitting the government.Ms Sturgeon said the ""fresh talent"" being brought into her government would help ""meet the challenges and opportunities facing the country in the months ahead"".Among the other changes are Mike Russell rejoining the cabinet as constitutional relations secretary and Humza Yousaf taking on the justice brief after swapping jobs with Michael Matheson who is now transport secretary. Derek Mackay's finance portfolio has been expanded, but John Swinney remains education secretary, while Fergus Ewing, Fiona Hyslop and Roseanna Cunningham have retained their jobs in rural affairs, culture and the economy respectively. The cabinet team, which has expanded from 10 to 12, is rounded out by Shirley-Anne Somerville as social security secretary - a newly elevated post - and Aileen Campbell as communities and local government secretary.Opposition parties had been calling for Ms Robison's head after a series of controversies in the health services.Her resignation letter to Ms Sturgeon said she had faced a ""particularly challenging"" year, including the loss of both her parents, a health scare and ""some big changes in my personal life"".The first minister replied that she would ""continue to seek [Ms Robison's] counsel as a colleague and a friend"".Ms Sturgeon's core team of cabinet secretaries had been unchanged since the last Holyrood election in May 2016, although there had been junior ministerial changes with Mark McDonald's resignation in November 2017.This is the most extensive reshuffle since Nicola Sturgeon replaced Alex Salmond as first minister in 2014. At least six ministers are out - including three of cabinet rank. The most widely anticipated departure was that of health secretary, Shona Robison. She's been under considerable pressure over NHS performance. She stood down on the day the Scottish government confirmed its worst cancer waiting times for six years. As a close friend of Nicola Sturgeon, she might have been expected to be given a new role in government. But in her resignation letter, Ms Robison said she wanted to ""focus on those closest to me"" after a series of challenges in her personal life. The economy secretary, Keith Brown, leaves government to concentrate on being SNP deputy leader - despite previously anticipating that he'd do both jobs.The resignation of communities secretary, Angela Constance, completes a trio of cabinet departures. This reshuffle comes on the same day the government shelved the Education Bill that was to be the centrepiece of this year's law-making programme. That announcement came from John Swinney, who remains as education secretary and deputy first minister. Ms Sturgeon said Keith Brown had left his role as business secretary to focus on putting the SNP on a ""campaign footing"" after winning the party's deputy leadership earlier this month.Mr Brown previously told the Sunday Post that being deputy leader would not affect his ability to serve in the cabinet. He now says he wants to ""give his all"" to the deputy leadership, and will be focusing on building towards the next Holyrood and Westminster elections and a possible independence referendum.The new ministers will need to be approved by a vote of parliament, which is expected to take place on Thursday after the junior ministerial team has been announced.A number of MSPs first elected in 2016 are expected to join the government at that point.The first minster said: ""The new cabinet I am announcing today brings fresh talent to the Scottish government and ensures that we are fully equipped to meet the challenges and opportunities facing the country in the months and years ahead.""With the impact of Brexit on our economy and wider society, it is right that the issues it presents are fully reflected at cabinet level, while the delivery of a new Scottish social security system also requires a voice at the cabinet table.""Those appointments, together with the reshaped portfolios announced today, mean that people can have confidence that the Scottish government will continue to deliver for people, public services and communities the length and breadth of the country.""Scottish Conservative deputy leader Jackson Carlaw said the refresh was ""a long time coming"", but said the government's ""time is up"".He said: ""There may well have been a few ministerial changes. But this is an SNP government that is tired, completely out of ideas and all over the place on key issues.""Scottish Labour MSP Rhoda Grant said the government ""has been out of touch and out of ideas for too long"".She said: ""This reshuffle is long overdue but the real change Scotland wants and needs won't come from changing the odd cabinet secretary - it will come from changing the government.""The Scottish Greens urged ""bolder action"" from the government following the reshuffle.Co-convener Patrick Harvie said: ""We face serious threats from Brexit and the climate crisis but also opportunities to tackle inequality, create a fairer economy, and improve the education and transport people rely on every day.""Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie said the SNP ""has nothing left to say"".He added: ""They're reduced to tantrums at Westminster and panic at Holyrood. The SNP's record is haunting them, they have lost direction and are now thrashing around for a solution."""

The government won a key vote in the Commons by 415 votes to 119 - a majority of 296. Tory MPs were under orders to support the government - but Boris Johnson, a leading opponent of expansion, missed the vote because he was in Afghanistan.Labour's official position was to oppose expansion, but its MPs were given a free vote. The SNP abstained. For: 415  Against: 119  Did not vote: 116 The vote was welcomed by business group the CBI as ""a truly historic decision that will open the doors to a new era in the UK's global trading relationships"".But Greenpeace UK said it was ready to join a cross-party group of London councils and the city's mayor, Sadiq Khan, in a legal challenge against the third runway.And Friends of the Earth said in a statement: ""MPs who backed this climate-wrecking new runway will be harshly judged by history. ""The evidence on the accelerating climate crisis, which is already hitting the world's most vulnerable people, is overwhelming - and expanding Heathrow will only intensify the misery."" Environmental activists earlier staged a ""lie-in"" over Heathrow in Parliament's central lobby, just metres away from MPs preparing to vote on the proposals.Police locked-down the area after 12 protesters, who described themselves as from a ""pop-up"" Vote No Heathrow campaign, sprawled across the floor chanting.The government has pledged the airport will be built at no cost to the taxpayer, will create 100,000 jobs and will benefit the entire country, through guaranteed internal flights to the rest of the UK.Ministers also insist the project will have built-in environmental protections, with the ability to fine Heathrow or ground aircraft if promises on night flights and other contentious issues are broken. Eight Conservative MPs voted against the government, including former cabinet ministers Justine Greening and Theresa Villiers, Greg Hands - who resigned last week as international trade minister - and Adam Afriyie, Sir David Amess, Bob Blackman, Zak Goldsmith and Matthew Offord.More Labour MPs supported the government than backed their leader Jeremy Corbyn, who had opposed the expansion.The development was supported by 119 Labour MPs, while 96 voted against the move.MPs from across the political spectrum, some with constituencies on the Heathrow flight path, spoke out against the plan.At the start of a four-hour debate, Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said Heathrow was ""full"" and a new runway was needed to secure ""a clear path to our future as a global nation in the post-Brexit world.""But in an impassioned speech, Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell warned that villages that had existed for 1,000 years would be ""wiped off the face of the earth"" to enable a company to maximise its profits.""There are human costs to this decision that this House needs to recognise and contemplate before they vote tonight to worry and blight my community once again on a programme that will never - pardon the pun - take off,"" he told MPs.Opposition MPs shouted ""Where's Boris?"" as a Conservative MP who resigned from government over Heathrow expansion urged colleagues to join him in opposing a third runway.Former International trade minister Greg Hands, who represents Chelsea and Fulham, raised concerns about air quality and night flights but said it was a ""debate about being true to your word and to your election pledges"".Mr Johnson said following Mr Hands' example and quitting the government to vote against Heathrow would ""achieve absolutely nothing,"" before departing on a trip to Afghanistan."

Research by the commission found voters were likely to engage with humorous campaign material, regardless of the trustworthiness of the source, without necessarily identifying it as part of the election battle.The watchdog said there was nothing wrong with campaigners using ""bots"" - automated programmes that spread messages - or telling their staff to post campaign messages on social media.""But these forms of campaigning are a problem when they are used to deceive voters about a campaigner's identity or their true level of support, or used to abuse people,"" it said in a report.A scheme set up for the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, which forced campaigners to put links in social media images linking back to details about who created them, worked well, the commission said, although there was no way of stopping campaigners posting anonymous propaganda on message boards.The Electoral Commission said the UK government and devolved administrations should be ready to impose direct regulation on social media companies if they fail to ensure ads carried on their platforms are legal.It is calling on social media companies, including Twitter, Google and Facebook, to deliver their proposals for online databases of political adverts in time for UK elections in 2019 and 2020.And it said the companies should put in place new controls to check that people or organisations who want to pay to place political adverts about elections and referendums in the UK are legally permitted to do so.""If voluntary action by social media companies is insufficient, the UK's governments should consider direct regulation,"" said Sir John.The Commission also recommended new checks to ensure that foreign money is not being used to influence UK elections and referendums.The watchdog also wants to be given stronger investigatory powers as well as the ability to impose fines ""significantly"" higher than the current maximum of £20,000 for breaches of the rules.A Cabinet Office spokesperson said: 'The government is committed to increasing transparency in digital campaigning, in order to maintain a fair and proportionate democratic process, and we will be consulting on proposals for new imprint requirements on electronic campaigning in due course."""

Mr Hendry said he was disappointed with the UK government's decision but he added: ""They're keen to look at other tidal technologies and that at least is positive. ""But they have therefore also taken 18 months which they could have almost said 'no' to it on day one.""The scheme off Swansea Bay had £200m backing from the Welsh Government.However the UK government said it would not pay TLP the fee it wanted for energy, although the lagoon's backers said a revised offer made it cheaper.TLP claimed no talks have taken place for two years at a UK level while its supporters have vowed to do what they can to make it a reality.Chairman Keith Clarke said: ""There has been no negotiation and it is not unreasonable to expect that government will now be willing to meet and discuss its position on Swansea Bay Tidal Lagoon in some detail. We have already requested that meeting.""TLP claimed the Swansea project would provide power to 155,000 properties in Wales and would be cheaper than nuclear power.The developers had previously asked for a 90-year contract with the UK government with an average strike price - a guaranteed price for the electricity generated - of £89.90 per megawatt hour. The new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point C in Somerset was given a strike price of £92.50/MWh for 35 years. The review by former energy minister Mr Hendry said Swansea should be used as a test of the technology, before allowing other developers to bid to construct further schemes as part of a competitive tendering process.Carwyn Jones told the BBC that the UK government's decision not to back the £1.3bn tidal lagoon was a ""political calculation"".He said he did not ""trust the figures the UK government has come out with"" to justify its position.Later, during First Minister's Questions in the Senedd, Mr Jones said the people of Swansea would be feeling ""huge disappointment"", which he acknowledged was shared by Conservative members of the assembly. However, a Wales Office spokesperson said: ""Now that people know the financial cost of the Swansea tidal lagoon, the limited economic opportunities and the risk higher energy costs pose to the steel and manufacturing industries, it is surprising that some people are still championing this specific project.""It would only have created 28 long term jobs and Hendry recognised that export opportunities were limited.  ""In seeking to find a solution, we looked at a package of six lagoons and could not support them because the cost per unit of electricity would have been more than twice the price of nuclear. Higher energy costs pose a significant risk to manufacturing industries.  ""The decision was made solely on the detailed analysis, including assessing the economic impact. The Welsh Government didn't disagree with the financial assessment.""David Clubb, a director at RenewableUK Cymru, the trade body for all renewable energy, has also criticised the rejection.""It's clear that the ability to meet carbon targets is going to be very difficult to meet if this is the signal sent to the renewable energy market,"" he said. Mr Clark told the Commons on Monday that although the Swansea Bay proposal ""has not demonstrated that it could be value for money does not mean that its potential is not recognised""."

The embassy helped to finance a book fair in Slough in 2017, which included speakers from Poland well-known for promoting hate speech in their country. Experts have questioned whether such speakers should be allowed into the UK.The embassy says it funded the event after ""appropriate assessment"" by Poland's Ministry of Foreign Affairs.The embassy confirmed to Newsnight that funding it provided to the Slough Book Fair paid for speakers' accommodation in Britain.One of the speakers at the Slough event was Marcin Rola, who moderated the discussion and runs a far-right online TV station in Poland, Wrealu24, which has more than 140,000 subscribers on YouTube.In a recent broadcast, Rola told his viewers that Sweden is ""top of the league table in terms of rapes by Muslim immigrant-invaders on women. On everyone. On animals, on holes in the fence. Because, well, we all know how they behave"".In the UK, many of Mr Rola's statements would qualify as hate speech. He has told viewers that ""in Islam, paedophilia is their daily bread"" and refers to Muslims as ""savages"".When Newsnight questioned Mr Rola about his rhetoric, he said his comments were ""taken out of context"". Although he admitted that calling Muslims ""savages"" was ""quite harsh,"" he ""stood by"" his comments, as he said they were in the context of discussing grooming gangs.The Slough Book Fair was organised by a UK-based chapter of far-right group Polska Niepodlegla.It was also behind a fun run in February 2017, at which it had hoped to host Jacek Miedlar, a former priest well-known for his anti-Semitic and anti-Muslim rhetoric.Miedlar was unable to attend the fun run when he was prevented from entering Britain. He was again stopped from coming into the country in June, when he was hoping to attend a Britain First rally in Birmingham.Asked about the Slough Book Fair, the Polish Embassy told Newsnight that it had funded the event after ""an appropriate assessment and receiving acceptance according to the regulations specifying the use of MFA budget funds"".However, Michal Garapich, who has been studying Polish migration in the UK for more than a decade, says that although the membership of far-right groups in the UK is quite small, the ones that exist are feeling stronger.""There are definitely more Polish Jehovah's Witnesses or Polish members of AA (Alcohol Anonymous) groups than there are far-right nationalists who organise themselves. But they have momentum now.""They are emboldened, they are more assertive.""Mr Garapich links the new assertiveness of the Polish far right to the change of government in Poland. He says the ruling party, Law and Justice, gives ""nationalist, far right, sometimes fascist groups quite a lot of political oxygen, a lot of exposure, and even access to public funds"".Fiyaz Mughal, from the anti-extremism organisation Faith Matters, says events like the Slough Book Fair form part of an attempt by the far right to gain a foothold among Poles in Britain. By holding events like book fairs and fun runs, extremist groups ""inject their intolerance, their bigotry, and their prejudice into these communities"", he added.""Let's call it what it is. It's a form of radicalisation.""Mr Rola, the moderator of the Slough discussion, came back to the UK in June to attend another edition of the book fair - this time in Leeds. This one was not funded by the Polish Embassy but was organised by the same group, Polska Niepodlegla.As soon as he reached arrivals at Luton Airport, he tweeted a photograph captioned: ""They didn't even frisk us.""Asked about Mr Rola's case, the Home Office refused to comment.A spokesman said the government is ""taking a comprehensive approach to defeat the scourge of extremism by supporting communities to promote our common values and confront extremism wherever it exists"".Watch the full investigation on BBC Newsnight at 22:30 on Monday on BBC2 and afterwards on iPlayer."
2018-06-25,What is DUP-Tory deal delivering?,https://web.archive.org//web/20180626192650/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-politics-44438973,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowLast year's snap general election result saw the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) thrust into the political spotlight like never before.The party negotiated an extra £1bn in spending for Northern Ireland over two years in exchange for supporting Theresa May's minority Conservative government. It was praised by some as proof that the DUP was delivering for people in Northern Ireland, but criticised by others who felt the Conservatives were ""bribing"" the DUP to keep themselves in power.Exactly one year on, the effects of the deal aren't exactly being felt everywhere.Head to north Belfast - where the DUP's Nigel Dodds has been the MP since 2001 - and there is a view that not much has changed in the past 12 months.On a bright Thursday morning in June, at the Shankill Women's Centre, a group is taking part in a conflict resolution class.Here, DUP and Sinn Féin supporters sit next to each other. Loyalists come face-to-face with republicans. Women affected by the Troubles, a period of violence spanning more than three decades in Northern Ireland before a peace agreement was brokered in 1998, share their experiences.Their views may differ drastically, but both sides agree that the last year in politics has been difficult for Northern Ireland.Lilian is a unionist and has traditionally voted DUP. She said, initially, news of the extra money for Northern Ireland was that it was ""good thing"", but that it had not become a reality.""Some of it's meant to go into the health service, but our health service here in north Belfast seems to have gotten worse,"" she said.""Money needs poured into centres like this all over. It's very frustrating if it's just sitting there waiting for someone to give the go-ahead.""Another woman, Loreen, takes a more optimistic view.""It has only been a year - a year's not long really, they're doing what they promised and getting all the money at some point is better late than never,"" she said.The DUP negotiated £1bn in extra spending for Northern Ireland over two years, with money allocated to go towards infrastructure, health, education, deprivation and ultra-fast broadband.In the months following, there was concern that the money would only be able to be spent when Stormont was restored.But in March, the government announced that £410m of the £1bn deal would be included in a new Stormont budget with money dished out to various areas.Downing Street has said that so far £430m has been released. £20m in 2017/18 was given to health and education while the £410m allocated for the Stormont budget is currently going through parliamentary approval procedures.The DUP MP, Emma Little-Pengelly, said her party stood by the agreement and what it had achieved for Northern Ireland.""The funding was specifically sought for areas that would be of benefit to people, regardless of their political persuasion or where they live across the province,"" she said.""It should not be forgotten that, as well as the financial package specifically for Northern Ireland, there are UK-wide benefits. ""Older people in Northern Ireland benefit from the move to maintain the pensions 'triple lock' just as they do across every region of the United Kingdom,"" she said.She also pointed to investment in the health service to tackle waiting lists and emergency care and investment to ""transform"" broadband in many rural areas of Northern Ireland.Back at the Shankill Women's Centre, community worker Eileen Weir said people in north Belfast have not felt any immediate benefits from the money the DUP secured.""In the areas that need investment, broadband is the last thing on their mind,"" she said.""I'm not saying it's wrong, but it's not an immediate priority in our area. We have families standing in queues for food banks - their priority isn't broadband. Who is delivering for us?""It's great they were able to negotiate such a package, but if you're not hands on with the communities who need the money most, you might not make the right decisions for where the money needs to go.""On the other side of the table sits Tina, who is from west Belfast, and a Sinn Féin voter.""We're all from working class areas and we're all feeling the pain of austerity,"" she said.""In the long run, the money isn't going to solve the problems alone. ""The deal was a bad idea, the DUP are propping up people who brought austerity to Northern Ireland and will probably make more cuts.""I ask if Sinn Féin's seven MPs should give up their long-standing policy of abstentionism and take their seats in the House of Commons so that nationalists can have a voice at Westminster, but Tina says the focus should be on restoring Stormont.""We're doing this conflict resolution class at the moment and it's tough. To get this far with the peace process must have been hard for the politicians.""We have to give them credit but right now they're acting like spoiled children - they should get back to work.""Northern Ireland has been without a functioning government since power-sharing collapsed in January 2017. Several rounds of talks to restore the institutions have failed.Eileen Weir feels the DUP-Tory deal hasn't done much to improve relations between the parties in Northern Ireland.""We need the DUP and Sinn Féin back working in that big white house on the hill,"" she said.""The people on the ground are talking the same language, it's just a pity that our politicians can't talk the same language."""

So what can we expect?""We don't have as many opportunities as Parnell did...but we're going to make it difficult for them.""So said one senior SNP figure to me last week, as the dust settled after their PMQs walkout.Charles Stewart Parnell, the 19th Century Irish Home Rule activist and MP, was one of Westminster's great disruptors.His ""obstruction"" campaign helped wreck business in the Commons and brought attention to the Irish Home Rule issue. He's commemorated with a bust in the Commons…just outside the SNP group office.Some in the SNP now think they can take a leaf out of his book.The party's MPs think Scottish voices are being sidelined in Brexit talks (something the UK government denies).They were particularly furious when just 19 minutes was set aside for discussion of the devolved aspects of the Withdrawal Bill.The walkout at PMQs, a number have told me, is just the start of a campaign of disruption.The standing orders in the Commons have changed since Parnell's day, as the quote from my source at the start alludes to.His tactic of filibustering to stop legislation being passed is considerably less easy these days, with debates normally time-limited, for example.But the SNP group at Westminster still think there are plenty of opportunities for mischief.The PMQs walkout was prompted after Ian Blackford tried to invoke Standing Order 163 (1), that the Commons should vote on sitting in private.It seems that was deliberately timed to happen during PMQs.The vote didn't take place, but it had been highly disruptive in the middle of the most high-profile event in the parliamentary week.It's a safe bet that those in the SNP whips' office are dusting off their copies of Commons rules to look for more opportunities.For now, they're remaining tight-lipped about what's next. In the words of one source, ""it wouldn't be a surprise if we told you...""Borrowing from Parnell, they could try and slow down the operation of Parliament by raising objections and calling for votes on business that's normally nodded through.But Mr Blackford suggests the focus will be on big occasions and denies suggestions the party is digging the trenches for a Parliamentary ""guerrilla war"".""We've got to do this in a way that's effective,"" he says.""Parliament operates in a different way than it did in Parnell's day... it's about using the current constricts in a way that lets us demonstrate to the government that we are very angry at the way they've treated us.""The main focus is likely to be Brexit legislation - for example the Trade Bill and the Customs Bill, both of which should be back in the Commons soon.Scottish government ministers have made it clear there's next to no chance they'll approve the bills, making them obvious targets.But could the frustration plan extend to other bills too?Take Heathrow. Yesterday the party refused to back expansion, despite firm support from the SNP Scottish government.One MP told me there was more space for such an approach ""in light of recent events"". Another told me it would have been too uncomfortable to vote with the Conservatives in the current climate.Officially, the Westminster party says this was about a lack of guarantees from UK ministers on how benefits for Scotland would be delivered.But UK government sources are convinced it's part of the frustration strategy - and it could backfire. One minister told me: ""First out of the blocks on non-cooperation and the SNP fall on their arse.""They should have chosen an issue that didn't involve hypocrisy. It means all non-cooperation now will be judged less about standing up for Scotland and more about standing up for the SNP."" More broadly, Whitehall sources argue disruption is about independence.They say the SNP is pursuing a ""grievance agenda"" designed to whip up resentment.But a government source told me they think ""people will see it for what it is"".The SNP deny that. But whichever side you agree with, it seems likely there will be more opportunities to discuss the merits of a disruptive approach soon."
2018-06-25,Boris mystery solved?,https://web.archive.org//web/20180626192650/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44606760,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAfghanistan is a long way to go to avoid an embarrassing vote in Parliament. The absence of Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson isn't the only telling thing about the Heathrow debate tonight, which stacks up to be a pretty good snapshot of the odd and confusing place our politics finds itself in at the moment.  The Conservatives officially back the policy but are corralling their MPs very strenuously to make sure they don't lose the vote after a minister resigned. One former cabinet minister told me today the ""whipping operation is ridiculous, they were even making sure I was going to be there"". But collective responsibility as it has traditionally functioned is out of the window. Cabinet ministers seem rather to have given up on trying to agree with each other (Heathrow isn't the only matter where there is very public discord).The Labour Party is opposing a policy tonight when it comes to Heathrow that their main backer and dozens of their MPs actually support. The Lib Dems are sticking to their principles of opposing Heathrow but with their size these days are finding it hard to make much noise about it. And the SNP who have been officially supportive of expanding the airport won't vote because they say they haven't had credible guarantees from the government. Clear? All this on a problem that Westminster has been arguing about for decades. It will pass tonight, but this is only, remember, only, the equivalent of the outline planning permission - gasp. Huge attention in the frothy end of the Westminster bubble has centred on the foreign secretary as - to his colleagues' frustration - it often does. During the first half of the day, much of SW1 engaged in a game of political Where's Wally? Speculation on top of speculation on top of speculation about where Boris Johnson could be. Was he still in his Foreign Office lair? In the air? Hiding in the tearoom of the House of Commons? The one place he was categorically not was chaining himself to bulldozers at Heathrow. Then, in the end, the Afghan foreign ministry gave it away by posting a picture of the foreign secretary and his counterpart together at a meeting in Kabul.The mystery of his whereabouts was solved, but not yet the mystery of the purpose. Afghanistan is not exactly an easy place to head for a quick hello.  Several sources in Westminster tonight suggest there was a serious reason. My colleague Jonathan Beale reported last month that the government was considering sending about 400 more troops to Afghanistan to join the 600 or so already there helping train Afghan forces.  Sources suggest tonight that the National Security Council will discuss the proposal tomorrow afternoon, with the government potentially approving the move, and a possible announcement in the coming days. The soldiers would not be involved in combat, but helping the Afghans provide more security in Kabul. It is suggested an uplift of 440 would make the UK the third biggest contributor in Afghanistan. It is a very long way from the troop numbers during the days of intense conflict. But a move that could give the UK more authority in the run up to a Nato summit at a time when the debate around our future defence is being intensely fought. "

2018-06-25,Parliamentary pact,https://web.archive.org//web/20180626192650/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-politics-44397110,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowTuesday marks a year to the day since Theresa May's Conservatives sealed a deal with the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) in order to keep the government afloat.It's known as a confidence-and-supply arrangement - meaning the government agreed a financial package with the DUP in exchange for support on certain issues.Here's a guide to everything that happened in the lead-up to the agreement, what was included in the deal and how it has been working for the past 12 months. After Mrs May called the snap general election last June, she did not do as well as she'd hoped and ended up without a Commons majority. The Conservatives got 318 seats, four short of the number a prime minister needs (technically it should be 326 seats - half of the overall number of MPs - but Sinn Féin's policy of abstentionism means its MPs do not take their seats). That spelled bad news for Mrs May, as it meant her government could be defeated on crucial Brexit votes during the UK-EU negotiations. In order to get around that, she looked to the DUP and its 10 MPs, to help give her a working majority of 328.At just three pages long, the deal sets out what the DUP agreed to support the Conservatives on, in exchange for financial support for Northern Ireland. It also states that the two parties would set up a coordination committee to oversee how the agreement would work in practice. The deal contains an assurance from the Conservatives that they will ""never be neutral in expressing their support for the union"". It also includes a commitment from the government to uphold the Good Friday, or Belfast Agreement (the 1998 deal that brought 30 years of conflict in Northern Ireland to an end) and a clause that the deal will remain in place for the length of this Parliament (usually five years). There is also a commitment that it will be reviewed by both parties at the end of each parliamentary session.Because it is not in coalition with the Conservatives. Rather, the two sides negotiated the confidence and supply arrangement. In exchange for support on key votes on Brexit, security and budgets, the DUP got money for Northern Ireland as well as the ear of the prime minister. The party negotiated an extra £1bn in spending for Northern Ireland over 2018 and 2019. The deal, however, specified that the DUP is not tied-in to supporting the government on every matter.In the months following, there was concern that the money would only be able to be spent when Stormont was restored. But in March, the government announced that £410m of the £1bn deal would be included in a new Stormont budget with money dished out to various areas. Downing Street has said that so far £430m has been released. In 2017/18, £20m was given to health and education while the £410m allocated for the Stormont budget is currently going through parliamentary approval procedures. Money for health was recently allocated to improve emergency department services in County Down. In April, the government said a consultation would take place to see how the £150m for broadband could best be used. It is understood that it could be 2020 before that investment materialises.Viewed as shrewd negotiators from decades of talks in the Northern Ireland peace process, the DUP also gained guarantees from the Conservatives on a range of policy priorities - such as keeping the guarantee to increase state pensions by at least 2.5% a year, to maintain defence spending, and agriculture spending in Northern Ireland at the same level for the rest of the current parliament (which theoretically takes us to June 2022). Not exactly. The DUP's deep religious roots mean it staunchly opposes abortion and same-sex marriage. When the deal was announced, there was criticism of Mrs May from some of her own MPs who did not want their party to be associated with the DUP's views. South Cambridgeshire MP Heidi Allen told the Commons she could ""barely contain her anger"" at the agreement.  The former Conservative Party chair Lord Patten even described the deal as ""toxic"". Scotland and Wales also expressed concerns that Northern Ireland could get special treatment from the government.When the deal was reached, power-sharing in Northern Ireland had stalled. The DUP-Sinn Féin executive had collapsed six months earlier, after a scandal concerning a flawed green energy scheme. Several rounds of talks chaired by the British government had failed - and when the DUP-Tory deal was announced some argued it had set the process back even further, making it harder for the British government to play its traditional role of neutral mediator. A year on, there's been no restoration of Stormont or implementation of direct rule from Westminster, leaving Northern Ireland in limbo. The government says it is still committed to getting devolution up and running again, but has been criticised by other Stormont parties for being too close to the DUP.While the DUP has stood by its promise to back the government on Brexit votes in the Commons, things were not so rosy last December. Just six months into the arrangement, the DUP threatened mutiny after criticising a proposal between the UK and the EU about the future of the Irish border. The DUP said its red line was any situation where Northern Ireland was treated differently from the rest of the UK. It forced the government to retreat from that plan, and to date, there has not been enough progress on the border question to allow the UK and EU to settle on a way forward. This issue could cause more rifts between the DUP and the Conservatives for some time to come.That depends on who you ask. Technically, it could last as long as the two parties agree to keep the agreement in place. Potentially up until the next general election is called. But coalitions and minority governments, no matter the form they take, are not often thought of as stable settings for governance - particularly in this period with uncertainty around Brexit and the stalemate at Stormont. The DUP's deputy leader Nigel Dodds has insisted that it is ""not a temporary two-year deal"", but Mrs May might not be just as confident."
2018-06-25,Corbyn's long march,https://web.archive.org//web/20180626192650/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44561407,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new window""Things can change - and they will."" A hopeful, positive message. Or a warning?These words were uttered by Labour's new leader Jeremy Corbyn at the special conference on 12 September 2015 when he decisively defeated the three other candidates.I was in the room at the Queen Elizabeth Conference Centre in central London - an odd place perhaps for a republican to be ""crowned"" party leader, perhaps.But it proved convenient for Jeremy Corbyn as it was within yards of a pro-refugee demonstration in Parliament Square which he addressed soon afterwards.His election was greeted by the strangest mixture of elation and trepidation. Three years on, and there is little doubt that he has changed his party.Speaking this month at the Labour Live event on home turf in north London he declared: ""The Labour Party is now 550,000 members - the biggest in my lifetime.""We are a proud and determined party. We need and can do things differently.""In the final edition of BBC Radio 4's documentary series The Long March of Corbyn's Labour I've looked at how the party's membership has changed, the implications of this for policy - and how a mass membership party can bring challenges as well as opportunities.Under a cut-price supporters' scheme introduced by Corbyn's predecessor Ed Miliband, people who had felt either alienated by mainstream politics or who had been to the left of the Labour leadership signed up to back the insurgent in the 2015 leadership contest.Once Corbyn was on the ballot, his campaign manager John McDonnell coined the phrase ""straight-talking honest politics"" - portraying him as a refreshing change from career politicians and the former ministers and special advisers who were his opponents.Having been an MP since 1983 and a councillor before that, it could of course be argued that Corbyn, too, was a career politician. But he looked and sounded different.And some of those who signed up to support him stayed on - becoming full members and, as it turned out, a bulwark against a sceptical - even hostile - Parliamentary Labour Party.Labour membership is falling back a bit now and confidential internal projections which we have seen - and which are used for financial planning purposes - predict it will decrease to around 500,000 by the end of the year.But this is still two-and-a-half times bigger than when the party boasted of its ""ground force"" in the disastrous 2015 election campaign.Soon after Corbyn's victory, a veteran of the party's left - Jon Lansman - was approached to set up, rather ambitiously, a whole new movement: Momentum. Lansman had been a key figure - nearly 40 years previously - in Tony Benn's campaign for Labour's deputy leadership.Momentum's aim in the short term was to ensure that Corbyn wasn't toppled.""It was founded out of his leadership campaign,"" Lansman said.""I was asked to do that job by John McDonnell, with the consent of Jeremy. As a result of that, we created something which looks actually very different from anything else on the Left - inside or outside of the Labour Party.""Corbyn initially put together a reasonably broad-based shadow cabinet but at local level, the party was changing.Lucy Powell  was chief of staff to Ed Miliband when he led Labour and, not long after he lost power, she witnessed a party in a state of metamorphosis. I met her in her Manchester Central constituency - and chose as a rendezvous the People's History Museum on the banks of the River Irwell.Deep in the basement of the museum is where the Labour Party stores its national archives. Here you can see letters signed by Labour's first leader Keir Hardie (rather like contemporary leaders, he was drumming up financial support from the unions).In more recent correspondence, Peter Mandelson and pollster Philip Gould discussed a review of party policy under Neil Kinnock - a prototype of the New Labour project.Lucy Powell told me she brought Jeremy Corbyn here when she had, briefly, been in his shadow cabinet. Although already reshaping the party for the future, he was fascinated by its past.She told me: ""Jeremy's staff were having kittens because he had to go to another function. He just didn't want to leave.""The archive also contains records of disciplinary cases and expulsions - underlining that the party has been riven many times by factional struggles before.Sadly, the minutes of Parliamentary Labour Party meetings are closed for the next two decades so we can't read for ourselves of the fractious meetings between Corbyn and his sceptical MPs.Lucy Powell herself left one of those meetings two years ago in some distress.She told me of the culture shock in her constituency when new members flooded in to support Jeremy Corbyn.""My constituency membership went up from 600 to 700 three years ago to over 2,300, it's now gone down a bit again.""It quadrupled in size, and that has brought great challenges as well as real opportunities... there was a bit of 'us and them' about it originally, with the older members calling newer members 'hard-left trots' and newer members calling the older members 'right-wing Blairites'.""Now though, she insists members are working more co-operatively together: ""We've definitely come through that and a lot of those relationships have now been established, but it was definitely difficult for a while.""John Stolliday was until this month one of Labour's most senior officials - the director of governance and legal.  He announced his resignation when Jeremy Corbyn's supporters tightened their grip on the party machine and installed a new general secretary, in overall charge of the party's head office.He joined Labour HQ 14 years ago, serving four party leaders - and had a broad overview of the changing nature of the party.Giving his first-ever interview, he described the rise in membership in 2015 as ""extraordinary.... no one saw it coming"".But who were these new members?""There were many young people who have never been members of political parties and who felt genuinely enthused by Jeremy and his message.""But, he explained, they weren't all political virgins.""There are many people who have joined from other political parties, from the Lib Dems, the Greens, the rag tag assortment of far-left parties and the Trade Union Socialist Coalition... and then also people who were members under Blair and then left because of the Iraq war.""And there is a bit of snag about where the new members are geographically, rather than politically.""They are concentrated in London and the south east of England. That's a problem.""For Labour to get into power, it absolutely has to win the constituencies with the smallest Tory majorities.""""They are in the Midlands and the M6 corridor in the North. They are home to many working class people.""And for some reason these people are not turning out to vote for the Labour Party - or indeed to join it.""But the new members were certainly in the right place at the right time for Jeremy Corbyn in Labour's internal battles.In his first six months as leader, party membership was rising but Jeremy Corbyn's political stock was falling.Behind in the polls, he looked vulnerable. But it was an attempt to oust him that solidified him in power.After what was seen as at best a lacklustre campaign on his part to keep Britain in the EU in 2016, his internal opponents made a move - but also made a series of miscalculations.The Parliamentary Labour Party decided they had no confidence in their leader. Eighty per cent of MPs opposed him, and many of the better-known faces left his shadow cabinet. Two assumptions had been made by his critics, and both turned out be wrong. The first was that having lost the confidence of so many of his MPs Corbyn would feel under a certain responsibility to resign.There seems little doubt he considered this, but those close to him say he didn't want to let down the members who had elected him. The second was that - in line with legal advice party officials had obtained - if his leadership was challenged, he would need 20% of MPs and MEPs - around 50 elected politicians - to nominate him to get on the ballot paper. It was assumed this would be too high a threshold to meet.In fact, in the end Labour's national executive - which wasn't under his full control at that moment - narrowly voted to put him on the ballot automatically without the need for nominations, and a subsequent legal challenge to this failed.Compounding this, his opponents couldn't agree a candidate and there was an internal contest within the parliamentary party between Angela Eagle and Owen Smith.Lucy Powell - one of those who resigned from Corbyn's shadow cabinet - regrets the move: ""It was a really big mistake. It was a collective misjudgement of what action should have been taken at the time.""It wasn't a plan. In fact if it had been a plan, it would have been a rubbish plan. It was a domino effect that took hold really, really quickly.""And John Stolliday also believes that emotion rather than wisdom prevailed. Membership had been falling from its peak and he thinks some of the newer members may have gone - or lost interest  - if a leadership contest had come later: ""I understand why the challenge came. But the MPs who led that challenge seemed to not realise the strength of feeling amongst the membership.""They forgot that many members of the Labour Party joined in 2015 to support Jeremy Corbyn.""When people joined the Labour Party they join on a year's contract.""For many people that would have expired in the summer, members were already dropping off by the time of the referendum in June.""The effect of the challenge… was to invigorate and electrify members.""This was the Left's moment. The push against Corbyn was portrayed as a putsch -  a coup against the membership. And Jon Lansman, Momentum's founder, said the Left could no longer be quite so relaxed about who controlled the levers of power in the party.""We expected it to come. And whilst Jeremy set out to be inclusive, we prepared for it.""Momentum was initially riven with factional strife - and a debilitating debate over whether its activists also had to be fully paid-up Labour members.As Lansman put it: ""Any start-up organisation goes through a painful period of creating itself.""But with a threat to Corbyn, enmities could be buried or shelved - and those on the Left could come together in common cause.That summer, Jeremy Corbyn played to his strengths - and played to the crowds - at leadership rallies. Momentum managed an impressive social media campaign. And he was re-elected with a higher share of the vote. A victory for Jeremy Corbyn but also for Momentum.Jon Lansman was delighted: ""We raised a great deal of money. We only had two or three thousand members before the coup. We came out of it with 20,000. We now have more than double that.""But a former Labour leader, Lord Kinnock - who had started out on the Left - felt too much time had been spent by Jeremy Corbyn and his supporters on changing his party rather than looking outwards to change the country.""I would say that Jeremy, and I doubt that he would disagree with this, comes from a segment in British politics, in Labour politics that has always existed, and is largely composed of people who give a higher priority to power in the Labour Party than power for the Labour Party.""And if they're ideologues it means that they have a convenient life because it means they only have to make a decision once in their life.""You can't drive a car or bring up a family like that. I don't think it is the reality of life.""But even after Corbyn's second leadership election, elements of the party machine - including crucially the national executive - weren't fully in his hands.That came later - after the 2017 general election.Although some seats were won by Labour MPs who publicly distanced themselves from Corbyn's leadership, the massive increase in the share of the vote led to the abandonment of two putative leadership challenges and from this point on, many of his internal opponents kept their heads down and their tongues bitten.John Stolliday says there was an active debate about broadening the political base of the shadow cabinet, but it didn't happen: ""There was an opportunity straight after the 2017 election for Jeremy Corbyn to look at the issues facing this country and to say 'I need the full range of talents of this party and that includes the senior and serious figures, the former ministers, who are on the backbenches now'. ""Jeremy had an opportunity to put these people in to his shadow cabinet and to say 'this is a united, unified party'.""Unfortunately he chose to reject that - and decided to instead reward loyalists and loyalty.""Indeed Jeremy Corby's supporters tightened rather than relaxed their grip following the election. Behind-the-scenes changes were resisted in a token fashion at best.As a senior figure in the parliamentary party confided off the record: ""The lunatics have taken over the asylum, it's just a game of survival for most of us - we are ploughing our own furrows and waiting for the madness to pass.""To reflect the much-expanded membership, three new seats were added to Labour's national executive, or NEC - and all three of these new positions were taken by members of Momentum, including its founder Jon Landsman.John Stolliday explained the importance of Labour's NEC: ""In the Labour Party, control of the NEC means that you control every decision that happens internally.""So, whether it's picking the longlist or shortlist for a by-election to see which candidate is going to be selected, whether it's deciding the party's priorities, the rule changes that will happen at conference, every decision is made by the NEC - control of the NEC is absolutely vital.""Another less well-known body has also had a change of management. The former GMTV political editor and MP Gloria De Piero and the former Eastender and Labour peer Michael Cashman - seen as supporters of New Labour - were outvoted as members of the Conference Arrangements Committee by the left-wing former trade union leader Billy Hayes and a community worker and constituency activist from Tottenham in north London, Seema Chandwani.  The committee influences what is discussed and when at Labour's annual gathering. Seema Chandwani is a member of Momentum and a left-wing group with a longer pedigree  - the Campaign for Labour Party Democracy. She saw this as a victory for democracy after many years in which, she believes, the Left had been kept well away from the reins of power, as well as a consequence of the expanded - and younger - membership.""These weren't random Martians coming from Planet Momentum. These were people who are active in our communities.""It struck a modicum of fear in some of the current members who were saying 'oh, we are going back to the eighties'.""But I said, what happened in the eighties? I was four in the eighties.""So important parts of Labour's machinery are now operated from the Left. But not everything has changed.Swathes of the Parliamentary Labour Party - while cowed  - remain sceptical of Corbyn's leadership. One senior figure told me ""the Corbyn phase will be over - when we lose the next election"". He believes we have seen ""peak Corbyn"".But as the 2017 result proved, the political future can be difficult to predict.And there are further changes to the Labour Party being planned in the name of empowering the mass membership.A ""democracy review"" is in full flight.Both Momentum and the Campaign for Labour Party Democracy are suggesting that the way the party's parliamentary candidates are selected should change, making it easier for party members at local level to trigger contests rather than re-adopting a sitting MP on the nod.This isn't, however, what's often referred to as mandatory reselections - effectively requiring MPs to get the backing of members in every parliament.The Left hasn't exactly been overwhelmingly successful at getting its candidates selected under the current system. The new MP for Lewisham East - elected this month - was not backed by Momentum or the influential left-wing Unite trade union.Local councillor Janet Daby was supported by groups that would once have been described as Brownite and Blairite - the campaign groups Labour First and Progress - though it's a measure of how the party has moved to the left that Janet Daby is now regarded as a ""moderate"". She voted for Jeremy Corbyn in both leadership contests.Lucy Powell said: ""I don't think you can see Momentum as a homogenous force sweeping the party. They are more effective when they are mobilising people online.""When it comes to local selections they have been much less effective because usually what people go for tend to go for a good strong committed local person.""Trying to parachute in a Momentum or Unite-favoured candidate doesn't work.""For Jon Lansman, though, time and effort will deliver. Perspiration is as important as inspiration for him: ""The party is a fundamentally different party and is committed to radical change.""The effect of having so many new members will eventually flow through. It hasn't got there yet.""Local government is hardly touched by the new membership, with the exception of one or two authorities.""We're still in the early days of trickling through the system.""For local government and then for Parliament - because you select a proportion of candidates every time - that will flow through.""I don't think there is any going back.""Momentum is running training sessions for new councillors, who in turn may become MPs.But even if the make-up of the Parliamentary Labour Party doesn't change dramatically in the short term, its power is set to diminish further.In 2015, candidates for the party leadership needed to demonstrate support from 15% of MPs and MEPs.This was reduced to 10% at last year's Labour conference.And now the Campaign for Labour Party Democracy wants the ability to shut out politicians from this process entirely.They are suggesting - when the time comes and Corbyn goes - that any candidate who wants to replace him would simply need to have the support of 10% of constituencies, or 10% of affiliated trade unions to avoid the need to have the backing of one in 10 of the parliamentary party.Seema Chandwani explained the thinking: ""You have got these shortlisting gatekeepers called MPs who have been elected to have that role.""From the perspective of the lay-member, should there really be any type of gate-keeping to get on the ballot paper?""The leader of the Labour Party is there not as the property of the MPs, they are the property of the whole party.""I asked her if these rule changes were more likely to result in a successor to Jeremy Corbyn who was just as left wing. She responded: ""It would be more likely that his successor is somebody members want. And if somebody they want is more Left, then that's democracy.""Jeremy Corbyn called his 2017 general election manifesto the star of the campaign and it's clear that Labour would tax more and spend more - those earning more than £80,000 and big corporations would pay more tax, and some services in private hands - such as the water industry in England and Wales - would be returned to the public sector.Many of the newer members in particular are delighted to see clear red water separating the opposition from the government.But there are fears that the enthusiasm of a mass membership could turn to disappointment - disillusion even - if the party doesn't deliver quickly enough on the pledges that Jeremy Corbyn recites at party rallies.One council that is already in the Momentum mould is Salford in Greater Manchester. Its mayor Paul Dennett is a strong supporter of Jeremy Corbyn. He shares his leader's passion for housing - and council housing in particular.The local authority has set up a housing company that embodies radicalism in its name. It's called Derive. But it's pronounced Dereeve.The name was derived (not dereeved) from Guy Debord, a member of the Paris-based Marxist Situationist collective, the Lettrist International - which, naturally enough, split from the Letterists - in the Fifties. It's all about designing urban environments around emotion and human behaviour.But looking at the company's construction plans in the mayor's office, the housing probably owes a bit more to Brookside than Bauhaus.The development that's getting under way is a mix of housing for rent, shared ownership and home for sale.This is hardly a return to the days when the ultra-left Militant Tendency (or Revolutionary Socialist League) controlled Liverpool Council, culminating - as then Labour leader Neil Kinnock put it in 1985 - ""in the grotesque chaos of a Labour council - a Labour council - hiring taxis to scuttle round a city handing out redundancy notices to its own workers"".Dennett, a Momentum member, has coined a term for his rather different approach: ""It's what I would refer to as sensible socialism. It's a pragmatic response to the context in which we find ourselves.""That isn't to say we're not trying to change the system.""With eight- yes, eight - new rented homes in the pipeline he knows he is making only a modest start but believes when a Labour government ends austerity, it will be possible to play his part fully in delivering the party's million homes pledge. For now he is giving a glimpse of the possible - erecting a signpost to a future direction. But he also has to work hard to manage the expectations of party members.""This is a continual challenge,"" he says.""I regularly attend branch meetings and we have got party members who see the manifesto and want me to implement it as quickly as I possibly can. ""It's been interesting to go through some of the policy and resource complexity with party members and in terms of their expectations around delivery they become more realistic.""If this is a challenge locally, the shadow communities secretary Andrew Gwynne - also Labour's joint election co-ordinator - knows it could be a nightmare nationally.""What gives me sleepless nights is that so many of the big ticket promises in Labour's manifesto will be down to local government to deliver,"" he tells me.""The worry for me is the ability and capacity of local councils to be able to deliver.""Behind the scenes in Whitehall, Labour has been preparing for government - with each shadow departmental team being given advice by the former head of the civil service, Lord Kerslake.Andrew Gwynne believes the party needs a clearer plan, and to be honest about which parts of Labour's manifesto can't be delivered swiftly if hope isn't to be eclipsed by disappointment.""It's going to take time to overcome eight years or more of Tory austerity. It is going to take time to build up capacity in central government, it is going to take time to build up capacity in local government and we've got to ensure that we have that right mix of offering hope and optimism and people being able to see change, but also not disappointing that change hasn't been quick enough or radical enough.""He also warns of the dangers if Labour fails to reconcile aspirations with the art of the possible.""If we come to power on the back of massive optimism, a new way of doing things, and we fall at the first hurdle then it will be very difficult to recover.""Lord Kinnock - as Neil Kinnock - began as a protégé of left-wing Labour leader Michael Foot in the 1980s. But as he moved to the centre, the party picked up support.He is urging the current leadership to ""compromise"" further with the electorate if its 40% at the last election is to be a building block not a ceiling.He thinks this may mean that party membership falls a bit, with some people drifting off to protest groups, but the prize would be wider support.""There has to be compromise with the electorate. And if the electorate isn't supporting you - you can't invent another one.""You have to deal with the people that exist, that have needs and hopes, and serve those needs and hopes in a way they can comprehend and can embrace.""There have also been unanticipated consequences of a mass membership.Sometimes in politics arguments emerge over means rather than ends.The leadership of both the country's biggest union, Unite, and Momentum wanted to see Labour move to the Left, and to keep Jeremy Corbyn at the helm.But there are differences over personnel - and how to preserve the leader's legacy. For many in Momentum - some of whom haven't risen through the ranks of 'organised labour' - a more democratic party that shifts power to the members is the best way of ensuring Labour remains on the Left.If this or that left-wing union general secretary were to be ousted, they fear the party - or at least its machine - in turn could drift to the the right.For example, the left-wing Unite leader Len McCluskey faced a leadership challenge last year, and then a legal challenge to his victory. Had he been removed the left-wing delegates he in effect appoints to Labour's ruling national executive could also have been replaced.A sign of this tension was when, briefly this spring, Momentum's Jon Lansman declared he would apply for the post of the party's most senior official - the general secretary. In doing so he was defying the party leadership who wanted to install the Unite official Jennie Formby.He later withdrew, telling me he simply wanted to see a ""proper process"".But these tensions have surfaced again recently - in Wales.Labour' s leader in the principality, the first minister Carwyn Jones, has announced he will stand down in the autumn.There is now a battle not so much over who should succeed him, but how his successor should be chosen - though the latter could determine the former.The method of selection is an ""electoral college"" giving unions and elected politicians two thirds of the vote and consigning grassroots members to one third.There will now be a hastily-arranged special conference in September to decide whether these rules should be changed - and those on the left in particular are calling for the power of selection to be in the hands of the rank and file. Darren Williams - a left-wing member both of Labour's ruling national executive and its Welsh executive - insists that changing the leadership rules is about more than faction-fighting.""Some of the resistance to a one member one vote contest in Wales comes from people who assume that [it] is more likely to favour a left-wing, pro-Corbyn candidate but I think there are arguments just based on which is the more democratic system.""But four big unions are resisting this move.       Mike Payne, of the GMB union in Wales, is warning that weakening the union voice in a leadership contest could have unintended consequences: ""The trade unions have always been the consistent body within the party that keeps it stable.""If you take away the voice of organised labour then the party becomes a mile away  from working people on a day to day basis and becomes remote.'        The UK leader is already chosen by the members but John Stolliday expects similar underlying tensions to become more apparent: ""There is a fundamental conflict Labour has to face in the next year or so.""Whether it is a party of the membership or of the trade unions and those who created it. It's almost an existential problem.""There is a delicate balance... it becomes more of a tyranny of the majority if one side gets to rule the roost.""Seema Chandwani has a foot in both camps - an activist in her constituency and with her union, Unite,She says: ""Who is in charge of the party - members or the affiliated organisations? That's been there pre-Corbyn and there is always going to be that tension of how do people maintain and use power.""I am not going to tell you there isn't going to be that tension or it's all going to be lovely.""And the leadership is challenged when the mass membership aren't quite in step with them.The Labour Live event this month wasn't a sell-out, politically or in terms of tickets. There were a few exceptions, but it was overwhelmingly attended by staunch supporters - admirers, even - of Jeremy Corbyn.But many also sported fluorescent stickers opposing, with rather colourful language, Brexit.A survey of party members carried out by Queen Mary University and YouGov suggested more than eight in 10 members supported staying in the single market - something Jeremy Corbyn hasn't, and possibly won't, endorse.Some of those wearing the stickers said they were simply expressing ""disappointment"" at Brexit, and not at the position of the party leadership.But Brexit is an issue which cuts across left/right lines - with even some grassroots members of Momentum calling for a new referendum.Jon Lansman explains the difficulty: ""It's very difficult to navigate - to win elections we need to take people with us with a range of views on Brexit.""So far Jeremy has done that extremely well. It may get more difficult.""Whatever the tensions over specific issues - proof, John McDonnell would contend, that the party leadership doesn't suppress what he calls ""robust debate"" - those on the left would argue that the political ground is shifting and that the membership are united by their radicalism.Time and again, leading Labour figures including Jeremy Corbyn use the word ""transformation"". They don't just want to change this or that tax rate, they really do want to change society.Many would buy into a concept popularised - if that's the word - by the Italian politician and Marxist philosopher Antonio Gramsci, who developed his thinking in the 1930s when he was imprisoned by Mussolini's regime.He argued that the ruling class exercised ""cultural hegemony"" - in effect that they imbued society with their assumptions, which became the received wisdom.So it wasn't surprising Labour Live was billed as a cultural as well as a political festival.Labour's leadership believe they have overturned what they term ""the neo-liberal consensus"" and have challenged the efficacy and morality of austerity.Jon Lansman believes that if a left-wing government does take power - despite all the constraints set out by Andrew Gwynne - vested interests will resist.And it's at this point Momentum will prove its true worth, he says.""We want to make a significant transformation. We want decisions which affect jobs and livelihoods democratised. The global corporations will resist. Other governments have faced challenges like runs on the pound. And we may face similar things. I hope we don't.""The people who are opposed to doing what we want to do have one thing in their favour - money. We have people.""We need the power of people to overcome the power of money.""Of course, it's possible Jeremy Corbyn won't make it to Downing Street - that the clash of people and corporations just doesn't happen.But the party he presides over has already changed.And those around him are unsurprisingly confident that some of the changes that have been wrought in the past few years are likely to be permanent.It was a relaxed shadow chancellor I encountered at Labour Live. John McDonnell was in open-necked shirt, stopping to chat with journalists and supporters.He told me that even if he and Jeremy Corbyn were to depart the scene Labour would remain an anti-austerity party - and ""there will be no triangulation"", where the main parties compete on similar territory.""That has gone now,"" he tells me.His close political ally Jon Lansman is confident, too, there is no going back to the politics of the Blair/Brown era.""The party has fundamentally changed,"" he says.""We're not going to go back to neo-liberalism, we're not going back to privatising the health service. That's decided forever. Well, for a generation or two.""But a measure of how the party has changed is that many of those who didn't back Jeremy Corbyn for leader are recognising this too.John Stolliday - who joined Labour's head office under Tony Blair - believes the current leader has a stronger grip on the levers of power than New Labour's founder and frontman.He said: ""Blair controlled the party through the popular weight of his determination to get into power, and people were willing because he won power so overwhelmingly in 1997.""Jeremy has uniquely managed to get hold of not just the membership of the party, but also of the NEC and the party structures.""No leader has ever controlled all the levers of power at the Labour Party before.""And Lucy Powell - Ed Miliband's former chief of staff who subsequently worked on Andy Burnham's failed leadership bid - agreed. ""Jeremy can be the leader for as long as he wants to be. No-one is going to challenge that at all. We just need  to get on with the job we're all elected to do.""But, she adds, ""with power comes responsibility"".Others at grassroots level, groups that were more comfortable with the pre-Corbyn era - Progress and Labour First - continue to try to combat control by the Left.Their members are not Marxists. They don't believe anything is historically inevitable. The Long March of Corbyn's Labour hasn't yet reached its destination."
2018-06-25,Most effective minister?,https://web.archive.org//web/20180626192650/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44565750,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowMichael Gove. Just the mention of his name on comedy shows elicits guffaws and groans. He's become a figure of hate among teachers, parents and children, and a figure of fun among voters as a whole. Yet talk to people in and around Westminster and a completely different man emerges. Whether they agree or disagree with his policies, they are united in their judgement: Gove has been the most effective minister of recent years.Most ministers, when they finally reach office, are surprised to find that when they pull on the levers of power very little happens. Gove seems to have learned how to fix the cogs and pulleys so that a tug at one end produces a tangible result at the other.Even his die-hard opponents can't deny that he has been effective. Mary Bousted is joint general secretary of the National Education Union, representing teachers. During his education reforms, she was one of Gove's greatest adversaries. ""Within 77 days of the 2010 general election he'd got the Education Reform Act through Parliament,"" she says.""The pace of change which he promoted was extraordinary. The problem with that, of course, is there are unforeseen and unintended consequences and casualties all over the place, which in recent years have very much tarnished his reforming reputation.""That's something you hear about Gove's education reforms from some critics. Other people praise the way he's introduced more rigour into exams and given schools more freedom. But the BBC Radio 4 programme I've made, Gove in Government, isn't about whether his policies are right or wrong.  And nor is it about his views on Brexit, his fallout with Boris Johnson, or his blundering bid for the Tory leadership. It is about Gove, the departmental minister. So how has he managed to be so effective, in three different government departments? Camilla Cavendish was head of the policy unit at No 10 when he was Lord Chancellor, running the Ministry of Justice. She told me: ""He had a laser-like focus about what he wanted to achieve and he was bloody minded about getting there. ""What I've observed from being in government is that unless you have those things as a cabinet minister, it's incredibly difficult to get anything done.""As well as a focus, though, Gove realised that he had to attract the right people into his private office: the junior to middle-ranking officials whose job it is to chase progress, demand improvements and often tell more senior civil servants that their work isn't good enough. This requires a degree of character and courage. Pamela Dow, his principal private secretary at Education who followed him to Justice, says it's inspiring to work for a minister who knows his mind and wants to change things. ""The fast-streamers would not normally have been excited to work at Defra, whereas now people really are, because it's nice to see the policy you're working on being talked about. Whether you're a supporter or not, no-one can deny that in every department he's gone to, he's had a radical vision, made waves about it and made a tangible difference."" Defra, of course, is the Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, usually rather a backwater in government. But Gove has transformed it. Outside Brexit, the main policy everyone's been talking about in the past few months has been how to reduce the amount of plastic we use. And that is an initiative Gove has been championing, after the scale of the problem was highlighted by TV series Blue Planet II.He likes to see himself as a revolutionary. On the walls of his office are posters of Lenin, Martin Luther King and Malcolm X - not the natural heroes of a Conservative politician. Early on in his ministerial career, he was perhaps too keen to make enemies of the establishment - which is why teachers took against him. In his later years, he has learnt his lesson and become more emollient. People who work with him find him charming and unfailingly polite. He's been known to disappear to a bookshop and return with a carefully chosen book for each member of his private office. Even his enemies, though, are disarmed by his courtesy. Mary Bousted was astonished when he gave her a bottle of gin recently as a wedding present. Sir David Bell was Gove's first permanent secretary in the Department for Education, and wasn't a natural ideological ally. But he too has a respect for the man. ""Michael has a legendary politeness. He was very good with officials, he was open, he listened. He had a voracious appetite for reading and he was completely engaged with the agenda. ""That was something that impressed officials. Here was somebody who was absolutely on top of the brief and who was prepared to put the hours in. Michael was clearly up to it intellectually, and he worked enormously hard to drive his agenda.""His four-year run as education secretary came to an end in David Cameron's July 2014 reshuffle, when Mr Cameron was advised by his strategist Lynton Crosby to ""get the barnacles off the boat"" ahead of a general election.It was suggested at the time that Gove was seen as ""the king of the barnacles"" because he was so toxic with teachers.A lot of people hate Michael Gove for what he did in schools, for his support for Brexit, for the way he knifed Boris Johnson in the back. His bid for the party leadership was a disaster. So Gove the politician may not have been a great success. But I've been really struck, in making this programme, by the number of people who've worked with him and against him who have the same view of Gove the minister. Nearly 40 years ago, the Labour politician Gerald Kaufman wrote a book that's still in print, called How to be a Minister. Whatever the recent speculation, I think it's highly unlikely that Gove will end up at No 10. He's too unpopular with voters. But perhaps next time he gets sacked, he should spend his time out writing a sequel. It might become a bible for the next generation of aspiring ministers.Mary Ann Sieghart is a writer and broadcaster. She worked alongside Michael Gove when he was a columnist for The Times newspaper.Gove in Government, on BBC Radio 4, runs on Sunday 24 June and will be available to listen to online after the broadcast.

2018-06-25,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20180626192650/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks  are now focusing on the detail of those issues and on future relations - after agreement was reached on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree within six months on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide, but first let's go back to the basics...It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.1% in the first three months of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.4%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand near a 40-year year low of 4.2%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 4.2% in the year to March 2018, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues. The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May was now put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. It will end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain-supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each playing roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanAn agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pounds buy fewer euros. A slump in the value of the dollar means the exchange rate with the pound is pretty close to where it was before the referendum.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.The UK has proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.A method for calculating the bill has been agreed, but the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more.The question of how and when payments will be made still needs to resolved, but it will be a schedule lasting for many years to come, and it is highly unlikely that anyone will ever be able to give an exact figure for the size of the divorce bill.UK sources say it will be up to £40bn, but some EU sources expect it to be higher than that. No-one can say for sure, and both sides want to keep it that way.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 6.5% in 2016 to 2.7% in 2017, according to the Halifax. It said the slowdown was driven by a squeeze on real wage growth.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-06-25,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180626192650/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to £840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

As I write, Mrs May is holed up with her advisers inside Tory HQ. But a former minister Anna Soubry has called for her to ""consider her position"" - political code for calling for her to resign.

On the two previous occasions in 1970 and February 1974 the PM and the party lost office. While there is no other conceivable administration in the new parliament other than a Conservative-led one, it remains to be seen whether the PM will retain her position. However, so long as the Conservatives can reach an accommodation with the DUP they will have a working majority in the House of Commons.  BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed:When the general election exit poll was revealed at 10pm, the pound immediately dropped by 2% as investors took a position that a hung parliament was a possible outcome of the general election.Why would that cause the currency to decline? Because a hung parliament means that the government's direction of travel would be less certain.

It argued that without such investment the UK armed forces' usefulness to the US would be diminished. ""The government must not let this happen,"" the report says.BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale says the committee's report will ""add fuel to what seems to be an increasingly acrimonious row between the defence secretary, Gavin Williamson, and the Treasury and the prime minister"".He says there have been warnings of a Conservative backbench rebellion if more funding is not forthcoming.Over the weekend the Mail on Sunday reported that Mr Williamson threatened to end Theresa May's leadership if she did not provide more money. But Chief Secretary to the Treasury Liz Truss warned cabinet colleagues that it is ""not macho"" to demand more funding.Speaking at an event in London, she said the £20bn a year budget boost for the NHS announced by Theresa May last week was a ""one-off"" and would not be replicated elsewhere.""My point to my colleagues is that any additional spending will necessarily - most likely - lead to additional taxation and we should be honest when we have that discussion,"" she said. ""We need to keep tax as low as possible.""Amid calls for extra resources for the military, Lord Houghton - chief of defence staff between 2013 and 2016 - said ""it would be a great shame"" if the armed forces budget was used as part of a ""political game"".He told BBC Radio 4's Today the current defence plans were ""unaffordable"" and the UK needed to ""make a decision"" about ""what sort of country we aspire to be"".Lord Houghton said: ""The first duty of government is the protection of the nation. ""We have slightly deluded the public of late that we have a defence programme that frankly we know is unaffordable. ""We are to an extent living a lie."" The MPs' report also notes comments by US Defence Secretary James Mattis that the UK benefits from its defence relationship with the US by £3bn a year. ""This implies that both the UK armed forces and HM Treasury benefit from our close relationship with the US,"" the report says.""However, that will continue to be true only while the UK military retains both the capacity and capability to maintain interoperability with the US military and to relieve US burdens.""At next month's Nato summit in Brussels, US President Donald Trump is expected to repeat his demands for European allies to spend more on defence.Defence committee member Madeleine Moon, Labour MP for Bridgend, said the UK's armed forces have been ""hollowed out"" with the navy ""very weak"" and air capability ""diminished"".She told Today: ""Influence is really important because unless you can back it up with capability, you have no credibility.""Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morningA spokesman for the Ministry of Defence said: ""The UK maintains the biggest defence budget in Europe we have been clear we will continue to exceed Nato's 2% spending target.""The defence secretary launched the Modernising Defence Programme to strengthen our armed forces in the face of intensifying threats."""

Theresa May said it was right the government listened to business voices about the terms of the UK's exit.This story contains language some may find offensive.Airbus, BMW and Siemens have warned about the impact on their UK-based operations if the UK leaves the EU next March without any agreement.Their warnings have prompted different responses from ministers. Business Secretary Greg Clark has said the UK must ""take and act on the advice of business"" but Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said a warning from Airbus that it could cease operations entirely in the UK, threatening thousands of jobs, was ""completely inappropriate"".Asked about corporate concerns over a so-called hard Brexit, at an event for EU diplomats in London last week, Mr Johnson is reported to have replied: ""Fuck business."" Mr Johnson, who was reportedly speaking at the time to Rudolf Huygelen, Belgium's ambassador to the EU, was also overheard saying he and others would fight Theresa May's soft Brexit ""and win"".The foreign secretary, who was a key figure in the Leave campaign, was pressed on the issue in Parliament by Labour MP Owen Smith, who asked him if the comments were correct and, if so, whether they could be ""remotely justified"".""I don't think anybody could doubt the passionate support of this government for business,"" Mr Johnson said.""It may be that I have, from time to time, expressed scepticism about some of the views of those who profess to speak up for business.""Mr Johnson's comments about Brexit have frequently proved controversial. He was recorded telling Tory donors last month that the UK's strategy lacked ""guts"" and suggested US President Donald Trump could do a better job.The latest remark has angered some Tory MPs, with former Science Minister George Freeman telling BBC Radio 4's World at One programme that the reported comments were not ""helpful, responsible or statesmanlike"".The prime minister, who will travel to Brussels on Thursday for a summit of EU leaders, told a chief executives summit hosted by the Times she wanted business to be able to speak to the government. ""It's right that we listen to the voice of business,"" she said.""Business is at the heart of how we are going to develop this country,"" she said. ""We want to ensure we are listening to the business voice because business provides the backbone of our economy.""MPs who favour a clean break with the EU after Brexit, in March 29 2019, have called on Mrs May to walk away from negotiations if the EU does not show willingness to begin trade talks immediately."

We also want action to support states to address the chemical terrorism threat.""Mr Johnson said the OPCW was ""the right body to study who is behind an attack"".BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale said British diplomats had launched a huge effort to win enough support to win a vote on the issue on Wednesday.But Russia opposed the plan, which might see its Syrian allies face further international condemnation, he added.Syrian opposition activists, rescue workers and medics say more than 40 people were killed in a suspected chemical attack on the Syrian city of Douma in April.France said it had ""proof"" that ""chemical weapons were used - at least chlorine - and that they were used by Bashar al-Assad's regime"".The Syrian government denied the allegation. And its key ally Russia said it had ""irrefutable evidence"" that the incident had been ""staged"" with the help of the UK.Meanwhile, the UK says Russian ex-spy Sergei Skripal, 66, and his 33-year-old daughter, who were found slumped on a park bench in Salisbury on 4 March, were exposed to a nerve agent belonging to the Novichok group.This analysis was backed by the international chemical weapons watchdog.The attempted murder of the pair on British soil led to accusations of Russian state involvement. Russia has denied involvement in the attack.Yulia Skripal left hospital a month after the attack, and her father was discharged a month later.Alastair Hay, an expert on chemical weapons at Leeds University, said the UK was ""absolutely right"" to press for new powers.""Whether it happens and whether there are sufficient votes that the UK can garner to support the move is still an open question really,"" he told the BBC.""Of course you have the UK, the Unites States, France and many others who want the OPCW to have those powers.""But there are others who are very concerned about it. And that includes Russia and some of its allies. So, it's divided and it's a question of how many allies the UK can muster."""
2018-06-26,Robison quits Scottish health post,https://web.archive.org//web/20180626192650/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-44612923,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowScotland's health secretary has quit as Nicola Sturgeon unveiled a major reshuffle of her Scottish government cabinet.There are five new cabinet secretaries in the first minister's expanded top team, which remains gender balanced.Shona Robison handed in her resignation as health secretary ahead of the reshuffle being announced. She will be replaced by Jeane Freeman, with Keith Brown and Angela Constance also quitting the government.Ms Sturgeon said the ""fresh talent"" being brought into her government would help ""meet the challenges and opportunities facing the country in the months ahead"".Among the other changes are Mike Russell rejoining the cabinet as constitutional relations secretary and Humza Yousaf taking on the justice brief after swapping jobs with Michael Matheson who is now transport secretary. Derek Mackay's finance portfolio has been expanded, but John Swinney remains education secretary, while Fergus Ewing, Fiona Hyslop and Roseanna Cunningham have retained their jobs in rural affairs, culture and the economy respectively. The cabinet team, which has expanded from 10 to 12, is rounded out by Shirley-Anne Somerville as social security secretary - a newly elevated post - and Aileen Campbell as communities and local government secretary.Opposition parties had been calling for Ms Robison's head after a series of controversies in the health services.Her resignation letter to Ms Sturgeon said she had faced a ""particularly challenging"" year, including the loss of both her parents, a health scare and ""some big changes in my personal life"".The first minister replied that she would ""continue to seek [Ms Robison's] counsel as a colleague and a friend"".Ms Sturgeon's core team of cabinet secretaries had been unchanged since the last Holyrood election in May 2016, although there had been junior ministerial changes with Mark McDonald's resignation in November 2017.This is the most extensive reshuffle since Nicola Sturgeon replaced Alex Salmond as first minister in 2014. At least six ministers are out - including three of cabinet rank. The most widely anticipated departure was that of health secretary, Shona Robison. She's been under considerable pressure over NHS performance. She stood down on the day the Scottish government confirmed its worst cancer waiting times for six years. As a close friend of Nicola Sturgeon, she might have been expected to be given a new role in government. But in her resignation letter, Ms Robison said she wanted to ""focus on those closest to me"" after a series of challenges in her personal life. The economy secretary, Keith Brown, leaves government to concentrate on being SNP deputy leader - despite previously anticipating that he'd do both jobs.The resignation of communities secretary, Angela Constance, completes a trio of cabinet departures. This reshuffle comes on the same day the government shelved the Education Bill that was to be the centrepiece of this year's law-making programme. That announcement came from John Swinney, who remains as education secretary and deputy first minister. Ms Sturgeon said Keith Brown had left his role as business secretary to focus on putting the SNP on a ""campaign footing"" after winning the party's deputy leadership earlier this month.Mr Brown previously told the Sunday Post that being deputy leader would not affect his ability to serve in the cabinet. He now says he wants to ""give his all"" to the deputy leadership, and will be focusing on building towards the next Holyrood and Westminster elections and a possible independence referendum.The new ministers will need to be approved by a vote of parliament, which is expected to take place on Thursday after the junior ministerial team has been announced.A number of MSPs first elected in 2016 are expected to join the government at that point.The first minster said: ""The new cabinet I am announcing today brings fresh talent to the Scottish government and ensures that we are fully equipped to meet the challenges and opportunities facing the country in the months and years ahead.""With the impact of Brexit on our economy and wider society, it is right that the issues it presents are fully reflected at cabinet level, while the delivery of a new Scottish social security system also requires a voice at the cabinet table.""Those appointments, together with the reshaped portfolios announced today, mean that people can have confidence that the Scottish government will continue to deliver for people, public services and communities the length and breadth of the country.""Scottish Conservative deputy leader Jackson Carlaw said the refresh was ""a long time coming"", but said the government's ""time is up"".He said: ""There may well have been a few ministerial changes. But this is an SNP government that is tired, completely out of ideas and all over the place on key issues.""Scottish Labour MSP Rhoda Grant said the government ""has been out of touch and out of ideas for too long"".She said: ""This reshuffle is long overdue but the real change Scotland wants and needs won't come from changing the odd cabinet secretary - it will come from changing the government.""The Scottish Greens urged ""bolder action"" from the government following the reshuffle.Co-convener Patrick Harvie said: ""We face serious threats from Brexit and the climate crisis but also opportunities to tackle inequality, create a fairer economy, and improve the education and transport people rely on every day.""Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie said the SNP ""has nothing left to say"".He added: ""They're reduced to tantrums at Westminster and panic at Holyrood. The SNP's record is haunting them, they have lost direction and are now thrashing around for a solution."""

The government won a key vote in the Commons by 415 votes to 119 - a majority of 296. Tory MPs were under orders to support the government - but Boris Johnson, a leading opponent of expansion, missed the vote because he was in Afghanistan.Labour's official position was to oppose expansion, but its MPs were given a free vote. The SNP abstained. For: 415  Against: 119  Did not vote: 116 The vote was welcomed by business group the CBI as ""a truly historic decision that will open the doors to a new era in the UK's global trading relationships"".But Greenpeace UK said it was ready to join a cross-party group of London councils and the city's mayor, Sadiq Khan, in a legal challenge against the third runway.And Friends of the Earth said in a statement: ""MPs who backed this climate-wrecking new runway will be harshly judged by history. ""The evidence on the accelerating climate crisis, which is already hitting the world's most vulnerable people, is overwhelming - and expanding Heathrow will only intensify the misery."" Environmental activists earlier staged a ""lie-in"" over Heathrow in Parliament's central lobby, just metres away from MPs preparing to vote on the proposals.Police locked-down the area after 12 protesters, who described themselves as from a ""pop-up"" Vote No Heathrow campaign, sprawled across the floor chanting.The government has pledged the airport will be built at no cost to the taxpayer, will create 100,000 jobs and will benefit the entire country, through guaranteed internal flights to the rest of the UK.Ministers also insist the project will have built-in environmental protections, with the ability to fine Heathrow or ground aircraft if promises on night flights and other contentious issues are broken. Eight Conservative MPs voted against the government, including former cabinet ministers Justine Greening and Theresa Villiers, Greg Hands - who resigned last week as international trade minister - and Adam Afriyie, Sir David Amess, Bob Blackman, Zak Goldsmith and Matthew Offord.More Labour MPs supported the government than backed their leader Jeremy Corbyn, who had opposed the expansion.The development was supported by 119 Labour MPs, while 96 voted against the move.MPs from across the political spectrum, some with constituencies on the Heathrow flight path, spoke out against the plan.At the start of a four-hour debate, Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said Heathrow was ""full"" and a new runway was needed to secure ""a clear path to our future as a global nation in the post-Brexit world.""But in an impassioned speech, Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell warned that villages that had existed for 1,000 years would be ""wiped off the face of the earth"" to enable a company to maximise its profits.""There are human costs to this decision that this House needs to recognise and contemplate before they vote tonight to worry and blight my community once again on a programme that will never - pardon the pun - take off,"" he told MPs.Opposition MPs shouted ""Where's Boris?"" as a Conservative MP who resigned from government over Heathrow expansion urged colleagues to join him in opposing a third runway.Former International trade minister Greg Hands, who represents Chelsea and Fulham, raised concerns about air quality and night flights but said it was a ""debate about being true to your word and to your election pledges"".Mr Johnson said following Mr Hands' example and quitting the government to vote against Heathrow would ""achieve absolutely nothing,"" before departing on a trip to Afghanistan."

Research by the commission found voters were likely to engage with humorous campaign material, regardless of the trustworthiness of the source, without necessarily identifying it as part of the election battle.The watchdog said there was nothing wrong with campaigners using ""bots"" - automated programmes that spread messages - or telling their staff to post campaign messages on social media.""But these forms of campaigning are a problem when they are used to deceive voters about a campaigner's identity or their true level of support, or used to abuse people,"" it said in a report.A scheme set up for the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, which forced campaigners to put links in social media images linking back to details about who created them, worked well, the commission said, although there was no way of stopping campaigners posting anonymous propaganda on message boards.The Electoral Commission said the UK government and devolved administrations should be ready to impose direct regulation on social media companies if they fail to ensure ads carried on their platforms are legal.It is calling on social media companies, including Twitter, Google and Facebook, to deliver their proposals for online databases of political adverts in time for UK elections in 2019 and 2020.And it said the companies should put in place new controls to check that people or organisations who want to pay to place political adverts about elections and referendums in the UK are legally permitted to do so.""If voluntary action by social media companies is insufficient, the UK's governments should consider direct regulation,"" said Sir John.The Commission also recommended new checks to ensure that foreign money is not being used to influence UK elections and referendums.The watchdog also wants to be given stronger investigatory powers as well as the ability to impose fines ""significantly"" higher than the current maximum of £20,000 for breaches of the rules.A Cabinet Office spokesperson said: 'The government is committed to increasing transparency in digital campaigning, in order to maintain a fair and proportionate democratic process, and we will be consulting on proposals for new imprint requirements on electronic campaigning in due course."""

Mr Hendry said he was disappointed with the UK government's decision but he added: ""They're keen to look at other tidal technologies and that at least is positive. ""But they have therefore also taken 18 months which they could have almost said 'no' to it on day one.""The scheme off Swansea Bay had £200m backing from the Welsh Government.However the UK government said it would not pay TLP the fee it wanted for energy, although the lagoon's backers said a revised offer made it cheaper.TLP claimed no talks have taken place for two years at a UK level while its supporters have vowed to do what they can to make it a reality.Chairman Keith Clarke said: ""There has been no negotiation and it is not unreasonable to expect that government will now be willing to meet and discuss its position on Swansea Bay Tidal Lagoon in some detail. We have already requested that meeting.""TLP claimed the Swansea project would provide power to 155,000 properties in Wales and would be cheaper than nuclear power.The developers had previously asked for a 90-year contract with the UK government with an average strike price - a guaranteed price for the electricity generated - of £89.90 per megawatt hour. The new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point C in Somerset was given a strike price of £92.50/MWh for 35 years. The review by former energy minister Mr Hendry said Swansea should be used as a test of the technology, before allowing other developers to bid to construct further schemes as part of a competitive tendering process.Carwyn Jones told the BBC that the UK government's decision not to back the £1.3bn tidal lagoon was a ""political calculation"".He said he did not ""trust the figures the UK government has come out with"" to justify its position.Later, during First Minister's Questions in the Senedd, Mr Jones said the people of Swansea would be feeling ""huge disappointment"", which he acknowledged was shared by Conservative members of the assembly. However, a Wales Office spokesperson said: ""Now that people know the financial cost of the Swansea tidal lagoon, the limited economic opportunities and the risk higher energy costs pose to the steel and manufacturing industries, it is surprising that some people are still championing this specific project.""It would only have created 28 long term jobs and Hendry recognised that export opportunities were limited.  ""In seeking to find a solution, we looked at a package of six lagoons and could not support them because the cost per unit of electricity would have been more than twice the price of nuclear. Higher energy costs pose a significant risk to manufacturing industries.  ""The decision was made solely on the detailed analysis, including assessing the economic impact. The Welsh Government didn't disagree with the financial assessment.""David Clubb, a director at RenewableUK Cymru, the trade body for all renewable energy, has also criticised the rejection.""It's clear that the ability to meet carbon targets is going to be very difficult to meet if this is the signal sent to the renewable energy market,"" he said. Mr Clark told the Commons on Monday that although the Swansea Bay proposal ""has not demonstrated that it could be value for money does not mean that its potential is not recognised""."

The embassy helped to finance a book fair in Slough in 2017, which included speakers from Poland well-known for promoting hate speech in their country. Experts have questioned whether such speakers should be allowed into the UK.The embassy says it funded the event after ""appropriate assessment"" by Poland's Ministry of Foreign Affairs.The embassy confirmed to Newsnight that funding it provided to the Slough Book Fair paid for speakers' accommodation in Britain.One of the speakers at the Slough event was Marcin Rola, who moderated the discussion and runs a far-right online TV station in Poland, Wrealu24, which has more than 140,000 subscribers on YouTube.In a recent broadcast, Rola told his viewers that Sweden is ""top of the league table in terms of rapes by Muslim immigrant-invaders on women. On everyone. On animals, on holes in the fence. Because, well, we all know how they behave"".In the UK, many of Mr Rola's statements would qualify as hate speech. He has told viewers that ""in Islam, paedophilia is their daily bread"" and refers to Muslims as ""savages"".When Newsnight questioned Mr Rola about his rhetoric, he said his comments were ""taken out of context"". Although he admitted that calling Muslims ""savages"" was ""quite harsh,"" he ""stood by"" his comments, as he said they were in the context of discussing grooming gangs.The Slough Book Fair was organised by a UK-based chapter of far-right group Polska Niepodlegla.It was also behind a fun run in February 2017, at which it had hoped to host Jacek Miedlar, a former priest well-known for his anti-Semitic and anti-Muslim rhetoric.Miedlar was unable to attend the fun run when he was prevented from entering Britain. He was again stopped from coming into the country in June, when he was hoping to attend a Britain First rally in Birmingham.Asked about the Slough Book Fair, the Polish Embassy told Newsnight that it had funded the event after ""an appropriate assessment and receiving acceptance according to the regulations specifying the use of MFA budget funds"".However, Michal Garapich, who has been studying Polish migration in the UK for more than a decade, says that although the membership of far-right groups in the UK is quite small, the ones that exist are feeling stronger.""There are definitely more Polish Jehovah's Witnesses or Polish members of AA (Alcohol Anonymous) groups than there are far-right nationalists who organise themselves. But they have momentum now.""They are emboldened, they are more assertive.""Mr Garapich links the new assertiveness of the Polish far right to the change of government in Poland. He says the ruling party, Law and Justice, gives ""nationalist, far right, sometimes fascist groups quite a lot of political oxygen, a lot of exposure, and even access to public funds"".Fiyaz Mughal, from the anti-extremism organisation Faith Matters, says events like the Slough Book Fair form part of an attempt by the far right to gain a foothold among Poles in Britain. By holding events like book fairs and fun runs, extremist groups ""inject their intolerance, their bigotry, and their prejudice into these communities"", he added.""Let's call it what it is.

2018-06-26,What is DUP-Tory deal delivering?,https://web.archive.org//web/20180626192650/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-politics-44438973,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowLast year's snap general election result saw the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) thrust into the political spotlight like never before.The party negotiated an extra £1bn in spending for Northern Ireland over two years in exchange for supporting Theresa May's minority Conservative government. It was praised by some as proof that the DUP was delivering for people in Northern Ireland, but criticised by others who felt the Conservatives were ""bribing"" the DUP to keep themselves in power.Exactly one year on, the effects of the deal aren't exactly being felt everywhere.Head to north Belfast - where the DUP's Nigel Dodds has been the MP since 2001 - and there is a view that not much has changed in the past 12 months.On a bright Thursday morning in June, at the Shankill Women's Centre, a group is taking part in a conflict resolution class.Here, DUP and Sinn Féin supporters sit next to each other. Loyalists come face-to-face with republicans. Women affected by the Troubles, a period of violence spanning more than three decades in Northern Ireland before a peace agreement was brokered in 1998, share their experiences.Their views may differ drastically, but both sides agree that the last year in politics has been difficult for Northern Ireland.Lilian is a unionist and has traditionally voted DUP. She said, initially, news of the extra money for Northern Ireland was that it was ""good thing"", but that it had not become a reality.""Some of it's meant to go into the health service, but our health service here in north Belfast seems to have gotten worse,"" she said.""Money needs poured into centres like this all over. It's very frustrating if it's just sitting there waiting for someone to give the go-ahead.""Another woman, Loreen, takes a more optimistic view.""It has only been a year - a year's not long really, they're doing what they promised and getting all the money at some point is better late than never,"" she said.The DUP negotiated £1bn in extra spending for Northern Ireland over two years, with money allocated to go towards infrastructure, health, education, deprivation and ultra-fast broadband.In the months following, there was concern that the money would only be able to be spent when Stormont was restored.But in March, the government announced that £410m of the £1bn deal would be included in a new Stormont budget with money dished out to various areas.Downing Street has said that so far £430m has been released. £20m in 2017/18 was given to health and education while the £410m allocated for the Stormont budget is currently going through parliamentary approval procedures.The DUP MP, Emma Little-Pengelly, said her party stood by the agreement and what it had achieved for Northern Ireland.""The funding was specifically sought for areas that would be of benefit to people, regardless of their political persuasion or where they live across the province,"" she said.""It should not be forgotten that, as well as the financial package specifically for Northern Ireland, there are UK-wide benefits. ""Older people in Northern Ireland benefit from the move to maintain the pensions 'triple lock' just as they do across every region of the United Kingdom,"" she said.She also pointed to investment in the health service to tackle waiting lists and emergency care and investment to ""transform"" broadband in many rural areas of Northern Ireland.Back at the Shankill Women's Centre, community worker Eileen Weir said people in north Belfast have not felt any immediate benefits from the money the DUP secured.""In the areas that need investment, broadband is the last thing on their mind,"" she said.""I'm not saying it's wrong, but it's not an immediate priority in our area. We have families standing in queues for food banks - their priority isn't broadband. Who is delivering for us?""It's great they were able to negotiate such a package, but if you're not hands on with the communities who need the money most, you might not make the right decisions for where the money needs to go.""On the other side of the table sits Tina, who is from west Belfast, and a Sinn Féin voter.""We're all from working class areas and we're all feeling the pain of austerity,"" she said.""In the long run, the money isn't going to solve the problems alone. ""The deal was a bad idea, the DUP are propping up people who brought austerity to Northern Ireland and will probably make more cuts.""I ask if Sinn Féin's seven MPs should give up their long-standing policy of abstentionism and take their seats in the House of Commons so that nationalists can have a voice at Westminster, but Tina says the focus should be on restoring Stormont.""We're doing this conflict resolution class at the moment and it's tough. To get this far with the peace process must have been hard for the politicians.""We have to give them credit but right now they're acting like spoiled children - they should get back to work.""Northern Ireland has been without a functioning government since power-sharing collapsed in January 2017. Several rounds of talks to restore the institutions have failed.Eileen Weir feels the DUP-Tory deal hasn't done much to improve relations between the parties in Northern Ireland.""We need the DUP and Sinn Féin back working in that big white house on the hill,"" she said.""The people on the ground are talking the same language, it's just a pity that our politicians can't talk the same language."""

So what can we expect?""We don't have as many opportunities as Parnell did...but we're going to make it difficult for them.""So said one senior SNP figure to me last week, as the dust settled after their PMQs walkout.Charles Stewart Parnell, the 19th Century Irish Home Rule activist and MP, was one of Westminster's great disruptors.His ""obstruction"" campaign helped wreck business in the Commons and brought attention to the Irish Home Rule issue. He's commemorated with a bust in the Commons…just outside the SNP group office.Some in the SNP now think they can take a leaf out of his book.The party's MPs think Scottish voices are being sidelined in Brexit talks (something the UK government denies).They were particularly furious when just 19 minutes was set aside for discussion of the devolved aspects of the Withdrawal Bill.The walkout at PMQs, a number have told me, is just the start of a campaign of disruption.The standing orders in the Commons have changed since Parnell's day, as the quote from my source at the start alludes to.His tactic of filibustering to stop legislation being passed is considerably less easy these days, with debates normally time-limited, for example.But the SNP group at Westminster still think there are plenty of opportunities for mischief.The PMQs walkout was prompted after Ian Blackford tried to invoke Standing Order 163 (1), that the Commons should vote on sitting in private.It seems that was deliberately timed to happen during PMQs.The vote didn't take place, but it had been highly disruptive in the middle of the most high-profile event in the parliamentary week.It's a safe bet that those in the SNP whips' office are dusting off their copies of Commons rules to look for more opportunities.For now, they're remaining tight-lipped about what's next. In the words of one source, ""it wouldn't be a surprise if we told you...""Borrowing from Parnell, they could try and slow down the operation of Parliament by raising objections and calling for votes on business that's normally nodded through.But Mr Blackford suggests the focus will be on big occasions and denies suggestions the party is digging the trenches for a Parliamentary ""guerrilla war"".""We've got to do this in a way that's effective,"" he says.""Parliament operates in a different way than it did in Parnell's day... it's about using the current constricts in a way that lets us demonstrate to the government that we are very angry at the way they've treated us.""The main focus is likely to be Brexit legislation - for example the Trade Bill and the Customs Bill, both of which should be back in the Commons soon.Scottish government ministers have made it clear there's next to no chance they'll approve the bills, making them obvious targets.But could the frustration plan extend to other bills too?Take Heathrow. Yesterday the party refused to back expansion, despite firm support from the SNP Scottish government.One MP told me there was more space for such an approach ""in light of recent events"". Another told me it would have been too uncomfortable to vote with the Conservatives in the current climate.Officially, the Westminster party says this was about a lack of guarantees from UK ministers on how benefits for Scotland would be delivered.But UK government sources are convinced it's part of the frustration strategy - and it could backfire. One minister told me: ""First out of the blocks on non-cooperation and the SNP fall on their arse.""They should have chosen an issue that didn't involve hypocrisy. It means all non-cooperation now will be judged less about standing up for Scotland and more about standing up for the SNP."" More broadly, Whitehall sources argue disruption is about independence.They say the SNP is pursuing a ""grievance agenda"" designed to whip up resentment.But a government source told me they think ""people will see it for what it is"".The SNP deny that. But whichever side you agree with, it seems likely there will be more opportunities to discuss the merits of a disruptive approach soon."
2018-06-26,Boris mystery solved?,https://web.archive.org//web/20180626192650/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44606760,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAfghanistan is a long way to go to avoid an embarrassing vote in Parliament. The absence of Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson isn't the only telling thing about the Heathrow debate tonight, which stacks up to be a pretty good snapshot of the odd and confusing place our politics finds itself in at the moment.  The Conservatives officially back the policy but are corralling their MPs very strenuously to make sure they don't lose the vote after a minister resigned. One former cabinet minister told me today the ""whipping operation is ridiculous, they were even making sure I was going to be there"". But collective responsibility as it has traditionally functioned is out of the window. Cabinet ministers seem rather to have given up on trying to agree with each other (Heathrow isn't the only matter where there is very public discord).The Labour Party is opposing a policy tonight when it comes to Heathrow that their main backer and dozens of their MPs actually support. The Lib Dems are sticking to their principles of opposing Heathrow but with their size these days are finding it hard to make much noise about it. And the SNP who have been officially supportive of expanding the airport won't vote because they say they haven't had credible guarantees from the government. Clear? All this on a problem that Westminster has been arguing about for decades. It will pass tonight, but this is only, remember, only, the equivalent of the outline planning permission - gasp. Huge attention in the frothy end of the Westminster bubble has centred on the foreign secretary as - to his colleagues' frustration - it often does. During the first half of the day, much of SW1 engaged in a game of political Where's Wally? Speculation on top of speculation on top of speculation about where Boris Johnson could be. Was he still in his Foreign Office lair? In the air? Hiding in the tearoom of the House of Commons? The one place he was categorically not was chaining himself to bulldozers at Heathrow. Then, in the end, the Afghan foreign ministry gave it away by posting a picture of the foreign secretary and his counterpart together at a meeting in Kabul.The mystery of his whereabouts was solved, but not yet the mystery of the purpose. Afghanistan is not exactly an easy place to head for a quick hello.  Several sources in Westminster tonight suggest there was a serious reason. My colleague Jonathan Beale reported last month that the government was considering sending about 400 more troops to Afghanistan to join the 600 or so already there helping train Afghan forces.  Sources suggest tonight that the National Security Council will discuss the proposal tomorrow afternoon, with the government potentially approving the move, and a possible announcement in the coming days. The soldiers would not be involved in combat, but helping the Afghans provide more security in Kabul. It is suggested an uplift of 440 would make the UK the third biggest contributor in Afghanistan. It is a very long way from the troop numbers during the days of intense conflict. But a move that could give the UK more authority in the run up to a Nato summit at a time when the debate around our future defence is being intensely fought. "

After Mrs May called the snap general election last June, she did not do as well as she'd hoped and ended up without a Commons majority. The Conservatives got 318 seats, four short of the number a prime minister needs (technically it should be 326 seats - half of the overall number of MPs - but Sinn Féin's policy of abstentionism means its MPs do not take their seats). That spelled bad news for Mrs May, as it meant her government could be defeated on crucial Brexit votes during the UK-EU negotiations. In order to get around that, she looked to the DUP and its 10 MPs, to help give her a working majority of 328.At just three pages long, the deal sets out what the DUP agreed to support the Conservatives on, in exchange for financial support for Northern Ireland. It also states that the two parties would set up a coordination committee to oversee how the agreement would work in practice. The deal contains an assurance from the Conservatives that they will ""never be neutral in expressing their support for the union"". It also includes a commitment from the government to uphold the Good Friday, or Belfast Agreement (the 1998 deal that brought 30 years of conflict in Northern Ireland to an end) and a clause that the deal will remain in place for the length of this Parliament (usually five years). There is also a commitment that it will be reviewed by both parties at the end of each parliamentary session.Because it is not in coalition with the Conservatives. Rather, the two sides negotiated the confidence and supply arrangement. In exchange for support on key votes on Brexit, security and budgets, the DUP got money for Northern Ireland as well as the ear of the prime minister. The party negotiated an extra £1bn in spending for Northern Ireland over 2018 and 2019. The deal, however, specified that the DUP is not tied-in to supporting the government on every matter.In the months following, there was concern that the money would only be able to be spent when Stormont was restored. But in March, the government announced that £410m of the £1bn deal would be included in a new Stormont budget with money dished out to various areas. Downing Street has said that so far £430m has been released. In 2017/18, £20m was given to health and education while the £410m allocated for the Stormont budget is currently going through parliamentary approval procedures. Money for health was recently allocated to improve emergency department services in County Down. In April, the government said a consultation would take place to see how the £150m for broadband could best be used. It is understood that it could be 2020 before that investment materialises.Viewed as shrewd negotiators from decades of talks in the Northern Ireland peace process, the DUP also gained guarantees from the Conservatives on a range of policy priorities - such as keeping the guarantee to increase state pensions by at least 2.5% a year, to maintain defence spending, and agriculture spending in Northern Ireland at the same level for the rest of the current parliament (which theoretically takes us to June 2022). Not exactly. The DUP's deep religious roots mean it staunchly opposes abortion and same-sex marriage. When the deal was announced, there was criticism of Mrs May from some of her own MPs who did not want their party to be associated with the DUP's views. South Cambridgeshire MP Heidi Allen told the Commons she could ""barely contain her anger"" at the agreement.  The former Conservative Party chair Lord Patten even described the deal as ""toxic"". Scotland and Wales also expressed concerns that Northern Ireland could get special treatment from the government.When the deal was reached, power-sharing in Northern Ireland had stalled. The DUP-Sinn Féin executive had collapsed six months earlier, after a scandal concerning a flawed green energy scheme. Several rounds of talks chaired by the British government had failed - and when the DUP-Tory deal was announced some argued it had set the process back even further, making it harder for the British government to play its traditional role of neutral mediator. A year on, there's been no restoration of Stormont or implementation of direct rule from Westminster, leaving Northern Ireland in limbo. The government says it is still committed to getting devolution up and running again, but has been criticised by other Stormont parties for being too close to the DUP.While the DUP has stood by its promise to back the government on Brexit votes in the Commons, things were not so rosy last December. Just six months into the arrangement, the DUP threatened mutiny after criticising a proposal between the UK and the EU about the future of the Irish border. The DUP said its red line was any situation where Northern Ireland was treated differently from the rest of the UK. It forced the government to retreat from that plan, and to date, there has not been enough progress on the border question to allow the UK and EU to settle on a way forward. This issue could cause more rifts between the DUP and the Conservatives for some time to come.That depends on who you ask. Technically, it could last as long as the two parties agree to keep the agreement in place. Potentially up until the next general election is called. But coalitions and minority governments, no matter the form they take, are not often thought of as stable settings for governance - particularly in this period with uncertainty around Brexit and the stalemate at Stormont. The DUP's deputy leader Nigel Dodds has insisted that it is ""not a temporary two-year deal"", but Mrs May might not be just as confident."
2018-06-26,Corbyn's long march,https://web.archive.org//web/20180626192650/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44561407,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new window""Things can change - and they will."" A hopeful, positive message. Or a warning?These words were uttered by Labour's new leader Jeremy Corbyn at the special conference on 12 September 2015 when he decisively defeated the three other candidates.I was in the room at the Queen Elizabeth Conference Centre in central London - an odd place perhaps for a republican to be ""crowned"" party leader, perhaps.But it proved convenient for Jeremy Corbyn as it was within yards of a pro-refugee demonstration in Parliament Square which he addressed soon afterwards.His election was greeted by the strangest mixture of elation and trepidation. Three years on, and there is little doubt that he has changed his party.Speaking this month at the Labour Live event on home turf in north London he declared: ""The Labour Party is now 550,000 members - the biggest in my lifetime.""We are a proud and determined party. We need and can do things differently.""In the final edition of BBC Radio 4's documentary series The Long March of Corbyn's Labour I've looked at how the party's membership has changed, the implications of this for policy - and how a mass membership party can bring challenges as well as opportunities.Under a cut-price supporters' scheme introduced by Corbyn's predecessor Ed Miliband, people who had felt either alienated by mainstream politics or who had been to the left of the Labour leadership signed up to back the insurgent in the 2015 leadership contest.Once Corbyn was on the ballot, his campaign manager John McDonnell coined the phrase ""straight-talking honest politics"" - portraying him as a refreshing change from career politicians and the former ministers and special advisers who were his opponents.Having been an MP since 1983 and a councillor before that, it could of course be argued that Corbyn, too, was a career politician. But he looked and sounded different.And some of those who signed up to support him stayed on - becoming full members and, as it turned out, a bulwark against a sceptical - even hostile - Parliamentary Labour Party.Labour membership is falling back a bit now and confidential internal projections which we have seen - and which are used for financial planning purposes - predict it will decrease to around 500,000 by the end of the year.But this is still two-and-a-half times bigger than when the party boasted of its ""ground force"" in the disastrous 2015 election campaign.Soon after Corbyn's victory, a veteran of the party's left - Jon Lansman - was approached to set up, rather ambitiously, a whole new movement: Momentum. Lansman had been a key figure - nearly 40 years previously - in Tony Benn's campaign for Labour's deputy leadership.Momentum's aim in the short term was to ensure that Corbyn wasn't toppled.""It was founded out of his leadership campaign,"" Lansman said.""I was asked to do that job by John McDonnell, with the consent of Jeremy. As a result of that, we created something which looks actually very different from anything else on the Left - inside or outside of the Labour Party.""Corbyn initially put together a reasonably broad-based shadow cabinet but at local level, the party was changing.Lucy Powell  was chief of staff to Ed Miliband when he led Labour and, not long after he lost power, she witnessed a party in a state of metamorphosis. I met her in her Manchester Central constituency - and chose as a rendezvous the People's History Museum on the banks of the River Irwell.Deep in the basement of the museum is where the Labour Party stores its national archives. Here you can see letters signed by Labour's first leader Keir Hardie (rather like contemporary leaders, he was drumming up financial support from the unions).In more recent correspondence, Peter Mandelson and pollster Philip Gould discussed a review of party policy under Neil Kinnock - a prototype of the New Labour project.Lucy Powell told me she brought Jeremy Corbyn here when she had, briefly, been in his shadow cabinet. Although already reshaping the party for the future, he was fascinated by its past.She told me: ""Jeremy's staff were having kittens because he had to go to another function. He just didn't want to leave.""The archive also contains records of disciplinary cases and expulsions - underlining that the party has been riven many times by factional struggles before.Sadly, the minutes of Parliamentary Labour Party meetings are closed for the next two decades so we can't read for ourselves of the fractious meetings between Corbyn and his sceptical MPs.Lucy Powell herself left one of those meetings two years ago in some distress.She told me of the culture shock in her constituency when new members flooded in to support Jeremy Corbyn.""My constituency membership went up from 600 to 700 three years ago to over 2,300, it's now gone down a bit again.""It quadrupled in size, and that has brought great challenges as well as real opportunities... there was a bit of 'us and them' about it originally, with the older members calling newer members 'hard-left trots' and newer members calling the older members 'right-wing Blairites'.""Now though, she insists members are working more co-operatively together: ""We've definitely come through that and a lot of those relationships have now been established, but it was definitely difficult for a while.""John Stolliday was until this month one of Labour's most senior officials - the director of governance and legal.  He announced his resignation when Jeremy Corbyn's supporters tightened their grip on the party machine and installed a new general secretary, in overall charge of the party's head office.He joined Labour HQ 14 years ago, serving four party leaders - and had a broad overview of the changing nature of the party.Giving his first-ever interview, he described the rise in membership in 2015 as ""extraordinary.... no one saw it coming"".But who were these new members?""There were many young people who have never been members of political parties and who felt genuinely enthused by Jeremy and his message.""But, he explained, they weren't all political virgins.""There are many people who have joined from other political parties, from the Lib Dems, the Greens, the rag tag assortment of far-left parties and the Trade Union Socialist Coalition... and then also people who were members under Blair and then left because of the Iraq war.""And there is a bit of snag about where the new members are geographically, rather than politically.""They are concentrated in London and the south east of England. That's a problem.""For Labour to get into power, it absolutely has to win the constituencies with the smallest Tory majorities.""""They are in the Midlands and the M6 corridor in the North. They are home to many working class people.""And for some reason these people are not turning out to vote for the Labour Party - or indeed to join it.""But the new members were certainly in the right place at the right time for Jeremy Corbyn in Labour's internal battles.In his first six months as leader, party membership was rising but Jeremy Corbyn's political stock was falling.Behind in the polls, he looked vulnerable. But it was an attempt to oust him that solidified him in power.After what was seen as at best a lacklustre campaign on his part to keep Britain in the EU in 2016, his internal opponents made a move - but also made a series of miscalculations.The Parliamentary Labour Party decided they had no confidence in their leader. Eighty per cent of MPs opposed him, and many of the better-known faces left his shadow cabinet. Two assumptions had been made by his critics, and both turned out be wrong. The first was that having lost the confidence of so many of his MPs Corbyn would feel under a certain responsibility to resign.There seems little doubt he considered this, but those close to him say he didn't want to let down the members who had elected him. The second was that - in line with legal advice party officials had obtained - if his leadership was challenged, he would need 20% of MPs and MEPs - around 50 elected politicians - to nominate him to get on the ballot paper. It was assumed this would be too high a threshold to meet.In fact, in the end Labour's national executive - which wasn't under his full control at that moment - narrowly voted to put him on the ballot automatically without the need for nominations, and a subsequent legal challenge to this failed.Compounding this, his opponents couldn't agree a candidate and there was an internal contest within the parliamentary party between Angela Eagle and Owen Smith.Lucy Powell - one of those who resigned from Corbyn's shadow cabinet - regrets the move: ""It was a really big mistake. It was a collective misjudgement of what action should have been taken at the time.""It wasn't a plan. In fact if it had been a plan, it would have been a rubbish plan. It was a domino effect that took hold really, really quickly.""And John Stolliday also believes that emotion rather than wisdom prevailed. Membership had been falling from its peak and he thinks some of the newer members may have gone - or lost interest  - if a leadership contest had come later: ""I understand why the challenge came. But the MPs who led that challenge seemed to not realise the strength of feeling amongst the membership.""They forgot that many members of the Labour Party joined in 2015 to support Jeremy Corbyn.""When people joined the Labour Party they join on a year's contract.""For many people that would have expired in the summer, members were already dropping off by the time of the referendum in June.""The effect of the challenge… was to invigorate and electrify members.""This was the Left's moment. The push against Corbyn was portrayed as a putsch -  a coup against the membership. And Jon Lansman, Momentum's founder, said the Left could no longer be quite so relaxed about who controlled the levers of power in the party.""We expected it to come. And whilst Jeremy set out to be inclusive, we prepared for it.""Momentum was initially riven with factional strife - and a debilitating debate over whether its activists also had to be fully paid-up Labour members.As Lansman put it: ""Any start-up organisation goes through a painful period of creating itself.""But with a threat to Corbyn, enmities could be buried or shelved - and those on the Left could come together in common cause.That summer, Jeremy Corbyn played to his strengths - and played to the crowds - at leadership rallies. Momentum managed an impressive social media campaign. And he was re-elected with a higher share of the vote. A victory for Jeremy Corbyn but also for Momentum.Jon Lansman was delighted: ""We raised a great deal of money. We only had two or three thousand members before the coup. We came out of it with 20,000. We now have more than double that.""But a former Labour leader, Lord Kinnock - who had started out on the Left - felt too much time had been spent by Jeremy Corbyn and his supporters on changing his party rather than looking outwards to change the country.""I would say that Jeremy, and I doubt that he would disagree with this, comes from a segment in British politics, in Labour politics that has always existed, and is largely composed of people who give a higher priority to power in the Labour Party than power for the Labour Party.""And if they're ideologues it means that they have a convenient life because it means they only have to make a decision once in their life.""You can't drive a car or bring up a family like that. I don't think it is the reality of life.""But even after Corbyn's second leadership election, elements of the party machine - including crucially the national executive - weren't fully in his hands.That came later - after the 2017 general election.Although some seats were won by Labour MPs who publicly distanced themselves from Corbyn's leadership, the massive increase in the share of the vote led to the abandonment of two putative leadership challenges and from this point on, many of his internal opponents kept their heads down and their tongues bitten.John Stolliday says there was an active debate about broadening the political base of the shadow cabinet, but it didn't happen: ""There was an opportunity straight after the 2017 election for Jeremy Corbyn to look at the issues facing this country and to say 'I need the full range of talents of this party and that includes the senior and serious figures, the former ministers, who are on the backbenches now'. ""Jeremy had an opportunity to put these people in to his shadow cabinet and to say 'this is a united, unified party'.""Unfortunately he chose to reject that - and decided to instead reward loyalists and loyalty.""Indeed Jeremy Corby's supporters tightened rather than relaxed their grip following the election. Behind-the-scenes changes were resisted in a token fashion at best.As a senior figure in the parliamentary party confided off the record: ""The lunatics have taken over the asylum, it's just a game of survival for most of us - we are ploughing our own furrows and waiting for the madness to pass.""To reflect the much-expanded membership, three new seats were added to Labour's national executive, or NEC - and all three of these new positions were taken by members of Momentum, including its founder Jon Landsman.John Stolliday explained the importance of Labour's NEC: ""In the Labour Party, control of the NEC means that you control every decision that happens internally.""So, whether it's picking the longlist or shortlist for a by-election to see which candidate is going to be selected, whether it's deciding the party's priorities, the rule changes that will happen at conference, every decision is made by the NEC - control of the NEC is absolutely vital.""Another less well-known body has also had a change of management. The former GMTV political editor and MP Gloria De Piero and the former Eastender and Labour peer Michael Cashman - seen as supporters of New Labour - were outvoted as members of the Conference Arrangements Committee by the left-wing former trade union leader Billy Hayes and a community worker and constituency activist from Tottenham in north London, Seema Chandwani.  The committee influences what is discussed and when at Labour's annual gathering. Seema Chandwani is a member of Momentum and a left-wing group with a longer pedigree  - the Campaign for Labour Party Democracy. She saw this as a victory for democracy after many years in which, she believes, the Left had been kept well away from the reins of power, as well as a consequence of the expanded - and younger - membership.""These weren't random Martians coming from Planet Momentum. These were people who are active in our communities.""It struck a modicum of fear in some of the current members who were saying 'oh, we are going back to the eighties'.""But I said, what happened in the eighties? I was four in the eighties.""So important parts of Labour's machinery are now operated from the Left. But not everything has changed.Swathes of the Parliamentary Labour Party - while cowed  - remain sceptical of Corbyn's leadership. One senior figure told me ""the Corbyn phase will be over - when we lose the next election"". He believes we have seen ""peak Corbyn"".But as the 2017 result proved, the political future can be difficult to predict.And there are further changes to the Labour Party being planned in the name of empowering the mass membership.A ""democracy review"" is in full flight.Both Momentum and the Campaign for Labour Party Democracy are suggesting that the way the party's parliamentary candidates are selected should change, making it easier for party members at local level to trigger contests rather than re-adopting a sitting MP on the nod.This isn't, however, what's often referred to as mandatory reselections - effectively requiring MPs to get the backing of members in every parliament.The Left hasn't exactly been overwhelmingly successful at getting its candidates selected under the current system. The new MP for Lewisham East - elected this month - was not backed by Momentum or the influential left-wing Unite trade union.Local councillor Janet Daby was supported by groups that would once have been described as Brownite and Blairite - the campaign groups Labour First and Progress - though it's a measure of how the party has moved to the left that Janet Daby is now regarded as a ""moderate"". She voted for Jeremy Corbyn in both leadership contests.Lucy Powell said: ""I don't think you can see Momentum as a homogenous force sweeping the party. They are more effective when they are mobilising people online.""When it comes to local selections they have been much less effective because usually what people go for tend to go for a good strong committed local person.""Trying to parachute in a Momentum or Unite-favoured candidate doesn't work.""For Jon Lansman, though, time and effort will deliver. Perspiration is as important as inspiration for him: ""The party is a fundamentally different party and is committed to radical change.""The effect of having so many new members will eventually flow through. It hasn't got there yet.""Local government is hardly touched by the new membership, with the exception of one or two authorities.""We're still in the early days of trickling through the system.""For local government and then for Parliament - because you select a proportion of candidates every time - that will flow through.""I don't think there is any going back.""Momentum is running training sessions for new councillors, who in turn may become MPs.But even if the make-up of the Parliamentary Labour Party doesn't change dramatically in the short term, its power is set to diminish further.In 2015, candidates for the party leadership needed to demonstrate support from 15% of MPs and MEPs.This was reduced to 10% at last year's Labour conference.And now the Campaign for Labour Party Democracy wants the ability to shut out politicians from this process entirely.They are suggesting - when the time comes and Corbyn goes - that any candidate who wants to replace him would simply need to have the support of 10% of constituencies, or 10% of affiliated trade unions to avoid the need to have the backing of one in 10 of the parliamentary party.Seema Chandwani explained the thinking: ""You have got these shortlisting gatekeepers called MPs who have been elected to have that role.""From the perspective of the lay-member, should there really be any type of gate-keeping to get on the ballot paper?""The leader of the Labour Party is there not as the property of the MPs, they are the property of the whole party.""I asked her if these rule changes were more likely to result in a successor to Jeremy Corbyn who was just as left wing. She responded: ""It would be more likely that his successor is somebody members want. And if somebody they want is more Left, then that's democracy.""Jeremy Corbyn called his 2017 general election manifesto the star of the campaign and it's clear that Labour would tax more and spend more - those earning more than £80,000 and big corporations would pay more tax, and some services in private hands - such as the water industry in England and Wales - would be returned to the public sector.Many of the newer members in particular are delighted to see clear red water separating the opposition from the government.But there are fears that the enthusiasm of a mass membership could turn to disappointment - disillusion even - if the party doesn't deliver quickly enough on the pledges that Jeremy Corbyn recites at party rallies.One council that is already in the Momentum mould is Salford in Greater Manchester. Its mayor Paul Dennett is a strong supporter of Jeremy Corbyn. He shares his leader's passion for housing - and council housing in particular.The local authority has set up a housing company that embodies radicalism in its name. It's called Derive. But it's pronounced Dereeve.The name was derived (not dereeved) from Guy Debord, a member of the Paris-based Marxist Situationist collective, the Lettrist International - which, naturally enough, split from the Letterists - in the Fifties. It's all about designing urban environments around emotion and human behaviour.But looking at the company's construction plans in the mayor's office, the housing probably owes a bit more to Brookside than Bauhaus.The development that's getting under way is a mix of housing for rent, shared ownership and home for sale.This is hardly a return to the days when the ultra-left Militant Tendency (or Revolutionary Socialist League) controlled Liverpool Council, culminating - as then Labour leader Neil Kinnock put it in 1985 - ""in the grotesque chaos of a Labour council - a Labour council - hiring taxis to scuttle round a city handing out redundancy notices to its own workers"".Dennett, a Momentum member, has coined a term for his rather different approach: ""It's what I would refer to as sensible socialism. It's a pragmatic response to the context in which we find ourselves.""That isn't to say we're not trying to change the system.""With eight- yes, eight - new rented homes in the pipeline he knows he is making only a modest start but believes when a Labour government ends austerity, it will be possible to play his part fully in delivering the party's million homes pledge. For now he is giving a glimpse of the possible - erecting a signpost to a future direction. But he also has to work hard to manage the expectations of party members.""This is a continual challenge,"" he says.""I regularly attend branch meetings and we have got party members who see the manifesto and want me to implement it as quickly as I possibly can. ""It's been interesting to go through some of the policy and resource complexity with party members and in terms of their expectations around delivery they become more realistic.""If this is a challenge locally, the shadow communities secretary Andrew Gwynne - also Labour's joint election co-ordinator - knows it could be a nightmare nationally.""What gives me sleepless nights is that so many of the big ticket promises in Labour's manifesto will be down to local government to deliver,"" he tells me.""The worry for me is the ability and capacity of local councils to be able to deliver.""Behind the scenes in Whitehall, Labour has been preparing for government - with each shadow departmental team being given advice by the former head of the civil service, Lord Kerslake.Andrew Gwynne believes the party needs a clearer plan, and to be honest about which parts of Labour's manifesto can't be delivered swiftly if hope isn't to be eclipsed by disappointment.""It's going to take time to overcome eight years or more of Tory austerity. It is going to take time to build up capacity in central government, it is going to take time to build up capacity in local government and we've got to ensure that we have that right mix of offering hope and optimism and people being able to see change, but also not disappointing that change hasn't been quick enough or radical enough.""He also warns of the dangers if Labour fails to reconcile aspirations with the art of the possible.""If we come to power on the back of massive optimism, a new way of doing things, and we fall at the first hurdle then it will be very difficult to recover.""Lord Kinnock - as Neil Kinnock - began as a protégé of left-wing Labour leader Michael Foot in the 1980s. But as he moved to the centre, the party picked up support.He is urging the current leadership to ""compromise"" further with the electorate if its 40% at the last election is to be a building block not a ceiling.He thinks this may mean that party membership falls a bit, with some people drifting off to protest groups, but the prize would be wider support.""There has to be compromise with the electorate. And if the electorate isn't supporting you - you can't invent another one.""You have to deal with the people that exist, that have needs and hopes, and serve those needs and hopes in a way they can comprehend and can embrace.""There have also been unanticipated consequences of a mass membership.Sometimes in politics arguments emerge over means rather than ends.The leadership of both the country's biggest union, Unite, and Momentum wanted to see Labour move to the Left, and to keep Jeremy Corbyn at the helm.But there are differences over personnel - and how to preserve the leader's legacy. For many in Momentum - some of whom haven't risen through the ranks of 'organised labour' - a more democratic party that shifts power to the members is the best way of ensuring Labour remains on the Left.If this or that left-wing union general secretary were to be ousted, they fear the party - or at least its machine - in turn could drift to the the right.For example, the left-wing Unite leader Len McCluskey faced a leadership challenge last year, and then a legal challenge to his victory. Had he been removed the left-wing delegates he in effect appoints to Labour's ruling national executive could also have been replaced.A sign of this tension was when, briefly this spring, Momentum's Jon Lansman declared he would apply for the post of the party's most senior official - the general secretary. In doing so he was defying the party leadership who wanted to install the Unite official Jennie Formby.He later withdrew, telling me he simply wanted to see a ""proper process"".But these tensions have surfaced again recently - in Wales.Labour' s leader in the principality, the first minister Carwyn Jones, has announced he will stand down in the autumn.There is now a battle not so much over who should succeed him, but how his successor should be chosen - though the latter could determine the former.The method of selection is an ""electoral college"" giving unions and elected politicians two thirds of the vote and consigning grassroots members to one third.There will now be a hastily-arranged special conference in September to decide whether these rules should be changed - and those on the left in particular are calling for the power of selection to be in the hands of the rank and file. Darren Williams - a left-wing member both of Labour's ruling national executive and its Welsh executive - insists that changing the leadership rules is about more than faction-fighting.""Some of the resistance to a one member one vote contest in Wales comes from people who assume that [it] is more likely to favour a left-wing, pro-Corbyn candidate but I think there are arguments just based on which is the more democratic system.""But four big unions are resisting this move.       Mike Payne, of the GMB union in Wales, is warning that weakening the union voice in a leadership contest could have unintended consequences: ""The trade unions have always been the consistent body within the party that keeps it stable.""If you take away the voice of organised labour then the party becomes a mile away  from working people on a day to day basis and becomes remote.'        The UK leader is already chosen by the members but John Stolliday expects similar underlying tensions to become more apparent: ""There is a fundamental conflict Labour has to face in the next year or so.""Whether it is a party of the membership or of the trade unions and those who created it. It's almost an existential problem.""There is a delicate balance... it becomes more of a tyranny of the majority if one side gets to rule the roost.""Seema Chandwani has a foot in both camps - an activist in her constituency and with her union, Unite,She says: ""Who is in charge of the party - members or the affiliated organisations? That's been there pre-Corbyn and there is always going to be that tension of how do people maintain and use power.""I am not going to tell you there isn't going to be that tension or it's all going to be lovely.""And the leadership is challenged when the mass membership aren't quite in step with them.The Labour Live event this month wasn't a sell-out, politically or in terms of tickets. There were a few exceptions, but it was overwhelmingly attended by staunch supporters - admirers, even - of Jeremy Corbyn.But many also sported fluorescent stickers opposing, with rather colourful language, Brexit.A survey of party members carried out by Queen Mary University and YouGov suggested more than eight in 10 members supported staying in the single market - something Jeremy Corbyn hasn't, and possibly won't, endorse.Some of those wearing the stickers said they were simply expressing ""disappointment"" at Brexit, and not at the position of the party leadership.But Brexit is an issue which cuts across left/right lines - with even some grassroots members of Momentum calling for a new referendum.Jon Lansman explains the difficulty: ""It's very difficult to navigate - to win elections we need to take people with us with a range of views on Brexit.""So far Jeremy has done that extremely well. It may get more difficult.""Whatever the tensions over specific issues - proof, John McDonnell would contend, that the party leadership doesn't suppress what he calls ""robust debate"" - those on the left would argue that the political ground is shifting and that the membership are united by their radicalism.Time and again, leading Labour figures including Jeremy Corbyn use the word ""transformation"". They don't just want to change this or that tax rate, they really do want to change society.Many would buy into a concept popularised - if that's the word - by the Italian politician and Marxist philosopher Antonio Gramsci, who developed his thinking in the 1930s when he was imprisoned by Mussolini's regime.He argued that the ruling class exercised ""cultural hegemony"" - in effect that they imbued society with their assumptions, which became the received wisdom.So it wasn't surprising Labour Live was billed as a cultural as well as a political festival.Labour's leadership believe they have overturned what they term ""the neo-liberal consensus"" and have challenged the efficacy and morality of austerity.Jon Lansman believes that if a left-wing government does take power - despite all the constraints set out by Andrew Gwynne - vested interests will resist.And it's at this point Momentum will prove its true worth, he says.""We want to make a significant transformation. We want decisions which affect jobs and livelihoods democratised. The global corporations will resist. Other governments have faced challenges like runs on the pound. And we may face similar things. I hope we don't.""The people who are opposed to doing what we want to do have one thing in their favour - money. We have people.""We need the power of people to overcome the power of money.""Of course, it's possible Jeremy Corbyn won't make it to Downing Street - that the clash of people and corporations just doesn't happen.But the party he presides over has already changed.And those around him are unsurprisingly confident that some of the changes that have been wrought in the past few years are likely to be permanent.It was a relaxed shadow chancellor I encountered at Labour Live. John McDonnell was in open-necked shirt, stopping to chat with journalists and supporters.He told me that even if he and Jeremy Corbyn were to depart the scene Labour would remain an anti-austerity party - and ""there will be no triangulation"", where the main parties compete on similar territory.""That has gone now,"" he tells me.His close political ally Jon Lansman is confident, too, there is no going back to the politics of the Blair/Brown era.""The party has fundamentally changed,"" he says.""We're not going to go back to neo-liberalism, we're not going back to privatising the health service. That's decided forever. Well, for a generation or two.""But a measure of how the party has changed is that many of those who didn't back Jeremy Corbyn for leader are recognising this too.John Stolliday - who joined Labour's head office under Tony Blair - believes the current leader has a stronger grip on the levers of power than New Labour's founder and frontman.He said: ""Blair controlled the party through the popular weight of his determination to get into power, and people were willing because he won power so overwhelmingly in 1997.""Jeremy has uniquely managed to get hold of not just the membership of the party, but also of the NEC and the party structures.""No leader has ever controlled all the levers of power at the Labour Party before.""And Lucy Powell - Ed Miliband's former chief of staff who subsequently worked on Andy Burnham's failed leadership bid - agreed. ""Jeremy can be the leader for as long as he wants to be. No-one is going to challenge that at all. We just need  to get on with the job we're all elected to do.""But, she adds, ""with power comes responsibility"".Others at grassroots level, groups that were more comfortable with the pre-Corbyn era - Progress and Labour First - continue to try to combat control by the Left.Their members are not Marxists. They don't believe anything is historically inevitable. The Long March of Corbyn's Labour hasn't yet reached its destination."
2018-06-26,Most effective minister?,https://web.archive.org//web/20180626192650/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44565750,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowMichael Gove. Just the mention of his name on comedy shows elicits guffaws and groans. He's become a figure of hate among teachers, parents and children, and a figure of fun among voters as a whole. Yet talk to people in and around Westminster and a completely different man emerges. Whether they agree or disagree with his policies, they are united in their judgement: Gove has been the most effective minister of recent years.Most ministers, when they finally reach office, are surprised to find that when they pull on the levers of power very little happens. Gove seems to have learned how to fix the cogs and pulleys so that a tug at one end produces a tangible result at the other.Even his die-hard opponents can't deny that he has been effective. Mary Bousted is joint general secretary of the National Education Union, representing teachers. During his education reforms, she was one of Gove's greatest adversaries. ""Within 77 days of the 2010 general election he'd got the Education Reform Act through Parliament,"" she says.""The pace of change which he promoted was extraordinary. The problem with that, of course, is there are unforeseen and unintended consequences and casualties all over the place, which in recent years have very much tarnished his reforming reputation.""That's something you hear about Gove's education reforms from some critics. Other people praise the way he's introduced more rigour into exams and given schools more freedom. But the BBC Radio 4 programme I've made, Gove in Government, isn't about whether his policies are right or wrong.  And nor is it about his views on Brexit, his fallout with Boris Johnson, or his blundering bid for the Tory leadership. It is about Gove, the departmental minister. So how has he managed to be so effective, in three different government departments? Camilla Cavendish was head of the policy unit at No 10 when he was Lord Chancellor, running the Ministry of Justice. She told me: ""He had a laser-like focus about what he wanted to achieve and he was bloody minded about getting there. ""What I've observed from being in government is that unless you have those things as a cabinet minister, it's incredibly difficult to get anything done.""As well as a focus, though, Gove realised that he had to attract the right people into his private office: the junior to middle-ranking officials whose job it is to chase progress, demand improvements and often tell more senior civil servants that their work isn't good enough. This requires a degree of character and courage. Pamela Dow, his principal private secretary at Education who followed him to Justice, says it's inspiring to work for a minister who knows his mind and wants to change things. ""The fast-streamers would not normally have been excited to work at Defra, whereas now people really are, because it's nice to see the policy you're working on being talked about. Whether you're a supporter or not, no-one can deny that in every department he's gone to, he's had a radical vision, made waves about it and made a tangible difference."" Defra, of course, is the Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, usually rather a backwater in government. But Gove has transformed it. Outside Brexit, the main policy everyone's been talking about in the past few months has been how to reduce the amount of plastic we use. And that is an initiative Gove has been championing, after the scale of the problem was highlighted by TV series Blue Planet II.He likes to see himself as a revolutionary. On the walls of his office are posters of Lenin, Martin Luther King and Malcolm X - not the natural heroes of a Conservative politician. Early on in his ministerial career, he was perhaps too keen to make enemies of the establishment - which is why teachers took against him. In his later years, he has learnt his lesson and become more emollient. People who work with him find him charming and unfailingly polite. He's been known to disappear to a bookshop and return with a carefully chosen book for each member of his private office. Even his enemies, though, are disarmed by his courtesy. Mary Bousted was astonished when he gave her a bottle of gin recently as a wedding present. Sir David Bell was Gove's first permanent secretary in the Department for Education, and wasn't a natural ideological ally. But he too has a respect for the man. ""Michael has a legendary politeness. He was very good with officials, he was open, he listened. He had a voracious appetite for reading and he was completely engaged with the agenda. ""That was something that impressed officials. Here was somebody who was absolutely on top of the brief and who was prepared to put the hours in. Michael was clearly up to it intellectually, and he worked enormously hard to drive his agenda.""His four-year run as education secretary came to an end in David Cameron's July 2014 reshuffle, when Mr Cameron was advised by his strategist Lynton Crosby to ""get the barnacles off the boat"" ahead of a general election.It was suggested at the time that Gove was seen as ""the king of the barnacles"" because he was so toxic with teachers.A lot of people hate Michael Gove for what he did in schools, for his support for Brexit, for the way he knifed Boris Johnson in the back. His bid for the party leadership was a disaster. So Gove the politician may not have been a great success. But I've been really struck, in making this programme, by the number of people who've worked with him and against him who have the same view of Gove the minister. Nearly 40 years ago, the Labour politician Gerald Kaufman wrote a book that's still in print, called How to be a Minister. Whatever the recent speculation, I think it's highly unlikely that Gove will end up at No 10. He's too unpopular with voters. But perhaps next time he gets sacked, he should spend his time out writing a sequel. It might become a bible for the next generation of aspiring ministers.Mary Ann Sieghart is a writer and broadcaster. She worked alongside Michael Gove when he was a columnist for The Times newspaper.Gove in Government, on BBC Radio 4, runs on Sunday 24 June and will be available to listen to online after the broadcast.

2018-06-26,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20180626192650/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks  are now focusing on the detail of those issues and on future relations - after agreement was reached on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree within six months on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide, but first let's go back to the basics...It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.1% in the first three months of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.4%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand near a 40-year year low of 4.2%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 4.2% in the year to March 2018, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues. The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May was now put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. It will end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain-supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each playing roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanAn agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pounds buy fewer euros. A slump in the value of the dollar means the exchange rate with the pound is pretty close to where it was before the referendum.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.The UK has proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.A method for calculating the bill has been agreed, but the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more.The question of how and when payments will be made still needs to resolved, but it will be a schedule lasting for many years to come, and it is highly unlikely that anyone will ever be able to give an exact figure for the size of the divorce bill.UK sources say it will be up to £40bn, but some EU sources expect it to be higher than that. No-one can say for sure, and both sides want to keep it that way.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 6.5% in 2016 to 2.7% in 2017, according to the Halifax. It said the slowdown was driven by a squeeze on real wage growth.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-06-26,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180626192650/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to £840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

On the two previous occasions in 1970 and February 1974 the PM and the party lost office. While there is no other conceivable administration in the new parliament other than a Conservative-led one, it remains to be seen whether the PM will retain her position. However, so long as the Conservatives can reach an accommodation with the DUP they will have a working majority in the House of Commons.  BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed:When the general election exit poll was revealed at 10pm, the pound immediately dropped by 2% as investors took a position that a hung parliament was a possible outcome of the general election.Why would that cause the currency to decline? Because a hung parliament means that the government's direction of travel would be less certain.

2018-06-27,Davies quits as Welsh Conservative leader,https://web.archive.org//web/20180627113412/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-44627729,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAndrew RT Davies has quit as leader of the Conservative group in the Welsh Assembly after seven years in charge.He had been criticised within the party for suggesting firms like Airbus were undermining Brexit by warning they could close UK plants.Theresa May said the Welsh Tories had been a ""strong voice for the people of Wales"" under his leadership. Preseli Pembrokeshire AM and deputy leader Paul Davies has been appointed interim leader by the group.Earlier Nick Ramsay, runner-up in the 2011 leadership contest, backed Paul Davies to take over on a permanent basis.A Conservative AM told BBC Wales there could be a ""coronation"".A party source said AMs were in conversations on whether there should be more than one candidate for the role, and therefore a contest.Another alleged Mr Davies's resignation followed an ""orchestrated plot from both ends of the M4"", warning of ""very dark times for Brexiteers"".On Friday, Andrew RT Davies had accused Airbus - which employs more than 6,000 people in Flintshire - of ""hyperbole"" in making ""threats"" to leave the UK because of fears that Brexit would hit trade.Guto Bebb, a Welsh Conservative MP and UK defence minister, condemned Mr Davies for making ""inflammatory"" remarks.He also disputed Mr Davies's title as leader of the Welsh Conservatives - rather than its assembly group - and said he did not speak in such a capacity.In a statement, Mr Davies said he was resigning as leader of the assembly group with ""deep regret"" following a group meeting on Wednesday.The South Wales Central AM said it had been a ""huge privilege to serve in this position since 2011, after securing the mandate of the party in a ballot of the membership"". ""I look forward to supporting whoever emerges from the contest to replace me, and I will continue to place all of my efforts into advancing the Welsh Conservative cause both here in Wales and Westminster,"" he added. ""As a party we would achieve nothing without the hard work and dedication of our grassroots and I would like to thank them all for the support they have given me in Wales. ""Nothing could make me prouder than to have enjoyed their backing throughout this journey.""Paying tribute to Mr Davies, Prime Minister Theresa May said: ""Under Andrew's leadership, the Welsh Conservatives have provided a strong opposition to Labour in Cardiff Bay and a strong voice for the people of Wales, both at home and in Westminster.""I know he will continue to be a passionate champion for the people of South Wales Central in the assembly, as he has been for more than a decade - and will continue to speak up for the best interests of Wales as we leave the European Union and forge a new role for the whole United Kingdom on the world stage.""First Minister Carwyn Jones said: ""Despite our obvious political differences, I always found Andrew to be good company, and he never broke the confidences I shared with him as leader of the opposition.""That is the sign of a decent and honest politician. ""Andrew has made his mark in Welsh politics, and his jovial and larger-than-life personality has always been a breath of fresh air during assembly proceedings. I wish him well in the future."" During his seven years leading the Conservatives in the assembly, Mr Davies appeared to be at odds with the wider party on a number of occasions.In the 2016 referendum on Europe he backed Brexit while the then Prime Minister David Cameron campaigned to remain in the EU.Some Tories were critical of Mr Davies for welcoming into the Tory assembly group ex-UKIP AM Mark Reckless - a former Conservative MP who had dramatically defected to UKIP on the eve of the Tories' 2014 party conference.  Mr Davies also denied reports of a spat with Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns over who should represent the Welsh Conservatives in TV debates in the 2017 general election campaign.After the party then lost three Welsh seats in the June poll, he called for more clarity on who should be designated leader of the Welsh Conservatives. Reacting to news of the resignation, Mr Cairns said: ""Andrew RT Davies has played a vital role in holding the Welsh Labour government to account in the Welsh Assembly since 2011.""As leader in the assembly he has a robust record of highlighting how a Welsh Conservative government could deliver a stronger Welsh economy.""Monmouth AM Nick Ramsay, who Mr Davies defeated in the 2011 leadership ballot of Welsh Conservative members, told BBC Wales he would not seek election this time around.He said: ""I've received a number of calls from party members this morning asking if I will be standing in the leadership election.  ""I'm not - I'm calling on Paul Davies to stand.""The Preseli Pembrokeshire AM served as interim Conservative group leader in 2011 after Nick Bourne lost his assembly seat and until Andrew RT Davies was elected to succeed him.Byron Davies, Welsh Conservative chairman, said: ""It has been my pleasure to work with Andrew over the years and I would like to thank him for all that he has done as leader of the Welsh Conservative group in the assembly.""UKIP AM Neil Hamilton said he was sorry Mr Davies had resigned. ""Andrew is a combative Brexiteer in a Tory group which is dominated by Remainers,"" he added.  Following his appointment by the Tory group as interim leader, Paul Davies paid tribute to Andrew RT Davies, saying he had made ""a huge contribution to Welsh politics and worked tirelessly to advance the Conservative cause in Wales"".He added that nominations for the permanent post of leader of the Tory group would ""open in due course"". Jovial and self-deprecating Andrew RT Davies is a ""take me as I am"" kind of man. Not many politicians refer to themselves as ""19 stone of prime Welsh beef"" and I can't think of another would-be first minister who would allow me to film them eating a plate of chips for breakfast on the campaign trail. In the latter stages of his seven years in charge there have been obvious tensions. As a staunch supporter of Brexit he came out on the winning side, a personal high point. But it made for a strained relationship with Downing Street. Critical comments about Airbus's threat to leave the UK angered some of his Conservative colleagues.If he thought something, invariably he said it or acted upon it.A case in point was his sustained backing for the Swansea Bay tidal lagoon in the face of growing evidence over time that the UK government wouldn't be backing the scheme. Earlier this year, Andrew RT Davies told me he'd be willing to step aside if it meant the Tories could form the next Government. And so a pro-Brexit leader has made way and Remainer Paul Davies is his likely successor.  That makes working with another party easier - even if forming the next Welsh Government is still a way off."
2018-06-27,Is Tory discipline close to breaking down?,https://web.archive.org//web/20180627113412/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44623620,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAfter their autumn conference the Tories had the blues. The spectacle of the prime minister's speech, that was as fun for those watching as having your eyelashes pulled out one by one, has been followed by many bumpy months, with muddling through being the modus operandi. The governing party certainly isn't happy, but Number 10 have managed to keep going, many Conservatives' frankly dumbfounded but frankly grateful that they are level-ish in the polls, even if those numbers sometimes slip behind. But as the mercury has hit the top of the gauge in the last couple of days, are the Conservatives in danger of tipping into serious summer madness?The Brexit fandango is reaching (another) climax. Don't expect too much from this week's Brussels summit, although it's quite possible the EU may be rather, shall we say, punchy, about the need for Britain to get on with it. But the weeks that follow will matter very much. The prime minister is due to see other European leaders again, either one on one in London, or abroad at the start of the week. Then, a week on Friday, she is summoning her whole Cabinet for a spot of country air. This meeting is not just to enjoy the bounty of the Home Counties, but (finally, again) to try to forge a consensus among the factions so that the poor old Brexit negotiators can know what on earth it is the government really wants them to fight for. The outline of this is to be expected in a Brexit White Paper, likely on 11 July, which will provide in a detailed way in black and white, the framework for Britain's relationship with the rest of the EU for decades to come. It is not just about finally concluding the messy episode that readers of this blog are very well used to, getting the cabinet to agree what form of customs arrangements are likely to take after Brexit. For all of the reasons we've discussed many times here this will not be easy. Customs arrangements sketch out only one of the dividing lines on a huge canvas of political disagreements. Jokes abound in SW1 already about the kind of vague compromise that will be reached on that - will it be a 'max-partnership', 'customs-fac' or 'partnership arrangement'. But what the government wants to do is come up with a more detailed version of the Prime Minister's Mansion House speech back in March where she gave her desired broad, very broad approach. EU diplomats say the White Paper simply has to be credible in Brussels, or else they will lose even more faith in the British ability to do a deal. But at home, it has to at least temporarily, get buy-in from a majority of members of the Cabinet, and at least, not be immediately trashed by the different wings of the Tory party. Surely they'll all want the same thing, you may cry. They are in the same party after all. Just in case you need a little reminder, only a few days ago the Trade Secretary, Liam Fox, told us it would be unacceptable to stay in the single market for goods when we leave the EU. This afternoon the Business Secretary, Greg Clark, almost went the full Norway. If you read this blog often enough I won't patronise you by going back through that again - if you don't there is an explanation here. But the run-up to that major event is becoming an ever more stroppy, ever more surreal political environment.  One minister told me it's like a bad 45 year marriage: ""We've stayed together for the sake of the kids, given birth to Brexit which is now ready to leave home and we're fighting now over who gets what.""A former senior minister said, ""it's just broken"", suggesting that the Cabinet does not understand how bad the situation really is. ""They are completely out of touch."" they said, blaming the prime minister's desire to keep everyone on side on Brexit for the boiling tensions, ""Everyone leaves the room thinking she has agreed with them. It's corrosive. You can argue it out to come to a position but she just won't.""In the next ten days there will be much, much more to say about the success or lack thereof of the next phase of the Brexit saga. If nothing else, if the heat wave lasts until then, gathered hacks will be able to look forward to sunbathing rather than freezing at the end of Chequers very, very long gravel drive - mad dogs and Englishmen and all that. While it is a messy picture though, there is not that much that's surprising about the backdrop. Brexit has been driving rival Tory factions crazy for many, many months. It's extremely difficult to corral them in a minority government. Different ministers sounding off about the misperceptions of their opposing gangs don't even always lead hacks to raise a pencil. But that instability has fuelled an atmosphere where party discipline seems on the point of breaking down, even though with the whips in overdrive, government is achieving its most important objective of getting its business through Parliament. Yet the Cabinet seems sometimes to be creating the appearance of chaos where there need not be any. For some of his colleagues, the Foreign Secretary's (yes, him) latest exploits have gone way past testing the patience of saints. What might have been defended as that phrase beloved by some, ""cheeky bantz' has become reputation-ruining stuff. This does not, repeat, does not, mean that it is all totally terminal for him. He is still a big figure in the party, still has a huge job in the government, and his supporters point to his unrivalled ability to get noticed, and to communicate plainly. There are only a tiny handful of politicians known by their first name in the country, who people cross the road to meet. He is one of them, even if these days as many of those who want a selfie might want to say something rude too. But in this fractious summer, Mr Johnson is certainly not the only one pushing the rules.Take the new-ish Defence Secretary. Keen, as occupants of that post are, to secure more funding for his department, Gavin Williamson is fighting hard to get more out of the Treasury coffers. He has an eager mini-army of defence stalwarts on the backbenches who he knows will be onside. No one ever fell foul either of the Tory membership by going soft on defence. But some of his colleagues are derisory about how brazen he has been. One of them scornfully told me, ""he's a child"", and some elements of Number 10 are losing patience too. Then there's Liz Truss who tonight has poked fun at her colleague Michael Gove, mocking his conversion to all things environmental, making a speech that essentially ridicules some of the Tories' own recent policies.  More seriously, Ms Truss, the number two at the Treasury, had a pop at Mr Williamson and the idea of raising taxes, when a major move on the NHS by the PM last week promised just that. In less than seven days there have been not just embarrassments and noises off, but more importantly very public statements of direction and ethos that seem to be contradictory. What is the public to make of it if one day one minister says it is well worth raising taxes to pay for the public services so many voters care about, if the next, a different minister says that is not their party's way? One former minister says ""what Liz and the Ministry of Defence is calling for is incompatible"". What is business supposed to make of a party which has traditionally stood alongside them, but whose ministers swing from saying they listen, to saying it's inappropriate for them to speak out?What is the rest of the Tory party, let alone the EU, to make of a party whose top brass seem to be enjoying disagreeing so much? Fingers point very quickly to the reason why this is happening. The prime minister has survived in office by (here supporters would say skilfully) keeping both sides of a divided party on board. But her critics say that leads to a vacuum which, in tweets tonight commentator Tim Montgomerie says, nature, and politics abhor. Define or be defined. Lead, or be led. If she won't try to make her arguments publicly, let alone privately, others will fill the silence.  And in the last couple of weeks it does seem that something has changed. It is not so much that we didn't know there was Tory disagreement, it is that some of the most senior figures seem to have stopped even trying to pretend that they agree. Perhaps this is a more honest way of doing politics and to be admired. Perhaps it is old fashioned to posit that it matters. But in our current system, governments need to be able to agree amongst themselves in order to decide what they want to do. And don't forget this isn't just pantomime, what they actually decide can affect all our lives. In ten days the prime minister is going to try to get her Cabinet to agree what they want from Brexit. Calm may have returned by then, a cool atmosphere of peace and harmony could have replaced all the fever. Politics moves so fast now that in a couple of weeks this blog might seem like something from another century. But Westminster, as well as the rest of the country, is feeling the heat. "

I mean stoves,"" she said in a speech at the London School of Economics.""I can see their point: there's enough hot air and smoke at the environment department already.""Former minister Ed Vaizey told BBC Radio 4's Today programme Ms Truss had achieved her goal of getting noticed with her ""full frontal assault"" on Mr Gove.Mr Vaizey also criticised Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson for undermining Prime Minister Theresa May, warning that ""having climbed up the ladder"" on Brexit, the government kept getting pushed ""back down the snake"".He said Mr Johnson's decision to pursue an ""entirely separate"" Brexit policy to the prime minister and to fly to Afghanistan to miss a vote on Heathrow expansion had encouraged other ministers to think ""if it's alright for Boris it's alright for me"".Quizzed about Ms Truss's comments in a Q&A with members of the Scottish Parliament, Mr Gove said: ""You should judge us as a government by our actions.""Over the past year the cabinet had ""worked together and we've sought to work collaboratively"", he added. Brexit has been driving rival Tory factions crazy for many, many months. It's extremely difficult to corral them in a minority government. Different ministers sounding off about the misperceptions of their opposing gangs don't even always lead hacks to raise a pencil.But that instability has fuelled an atmosphere where party discipline seems on the point of breaking down, even though with the whips in overdrive, government is achieving its most important objective of getting its business through Parliament.Yet the Cabinet seems sometimes to be creating the appearance of chaos where there need not be any.Read Laura's full blogThe latest bout of infighting at the top of government started at the weekend, when Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson reportedly said that he could ""break"" the prime minister if his demands for extra cash for his department were not met.Home Secretary Sajid Javid has also been demanding more money for police budgets, after Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt unveiled a £20bn boost in funding for the NHS. Ms Truss, who his second in command to Chancellor Philip Hammond, hit back in article for The Daily Telegraph, telling her cabinet colleagues ""it's not macho to demand more money"". ""It's much tougher - and fairer to people - to demand better value for money.""The Chief Secretary to the Treasury went on to accuse them of ""not been clear with the public about the tax implications of their proposed higher spending"".Speaking at the London School of Economics, she said the £20bn a year budget boost for the NHS in England up to 2023 announced by the prime minister last week would not be replicated elsewhere.""My point to my colleagues is that any additional spending will necessarily - most likely - lead to additional taxation and we should be honest when we have that discussion,"" she said. ""We need to keep tax as low as possible.""Ms Truss's comments echo those of former minister George Freeman, who said that the Conservatives risked losing the next election if they made a series of unfunded spending commitments.""We cannot have this process done by cabinet ministers going to the press and briefing against the prime minister, and putting their bids in early,"" he said.The government has yet to spell out where the extra money for the NHS will come from although Mrs May has indicated that the public will have to make a contribution and the overall ""tax burden"" will rise. Mr Hammond will set out the total public spending framework for the years beyond 2020 in this autumn's budget, before deciding department-by-department allocations next year. Many Tory MPs want defence spending as a share of GDP to increase from its current level of just over 2% to at least 3% in the face of growing threats, including from Russia."
2018-06-27,Bank warning for EU over Brexit progress,https://web.archive.org//web/20180627113412/https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44629271,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe Bank of England says the UK has made positive ""progress"" on handling financial services risks around the UK's departure from the European Union. But it also says there has been a lack of similar action from the EU.It says that means ""material risks remain"" to trillions of pounds worth of financial contracts - which support the business activities that flow between the UK and rest of Europe.The findings come in the bank's bi-annual Financial Stability Report.The report said the passing of the EU Withdrawal Bill and Treasury plans for a ""temporary permissions"" system - for continuing cross-border financial trade - had eased the ""risk of disruption"".""Progress has been made in the UK towards mitigating risks of disruption to the availability of financial services to UK-end users,"" the report said.""The EU (Withdrawal) Bill has been passed by Parliament.""The UK government has committed to legislate, if necessary, to put in place temporary permissions and recognition regimes - this will allow banks [and] insurers to continue their activities in the UK for a time-limited period after the UK has left the EU, even if there is no implementation period, thus mitigating a number of risks of disruption to UK customers.""But it added: ""As yet the EU has not indicated a solution analogous to a temporary permissions regime. European Economic Area customers remain reliant on UK-based financial companies being able to overcome any future barriers to cross service provision.""The Financial Policy Committee judges that material risks remain.""The Bank said that the UK's banks were sufficiently robust to weather a ""disorderly Brexit"".But despite the progress, its Brexit risk register still has amber warnings on progress towards ensuring there is a legal and regulatory plan in place once Britain leaves the EU.For the UK, there is a single red warning on the continuing validity of contracts used to insure businesses making currency trades, for example, involving institutions in Britain and the EU.There are believed to be £29 trillion worth of such contracts which could become ""unserviceable"" after March next year if action is not taken.The Bank says the EU is facing three ""red light"" issues.Two are on contracts and one on is on clearing - the ability to finalise deals and trades across borders between banks, businesses and fund managers.Both sides also face amber warnings on the ability of banks and asset managers to continue providing other services across borders, as well as on the lack of agreement on the cross-border flow of personal data between Britain and the EU."
2018-06-27,Civil partnership win for mixed-sex couple,https://web.archive.org//web/20180627113412/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-44627990,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowA heterosexual couple have won their legal bid for the right to have a civil partnership instead of a marriage.The Supreme Court unanimously ruled in favour of Rebecca Steinfeld, 37, and Charles Keidan, 41, from London.The court said the Civil Partnership Act 2004  - which only applies to same-sex couples - is incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights. Ms Steinfeld said she hoped the government does the ""right thing"" and extends civil partnerships to all.""We are feeling elated,"" she told the BBC outside court. ""But at the same time we are feeling frustrated the government has wasted taxpayers' money in fighting what the judges' have called a blatant inequality.""The judgement does not oblige government to change the law, although it does make it more likely that the government will now act, the BBC's legal correspondent Clive Coleman explained. In a civil partnership, a couple is entitled to the same legal treatment in terms of inheritance, tax, pensions and next-of-kin arrangements as marriage. The couple, who met in 2010 and have two children, said the ""legacy of marriage"" which ""treated women as property for centuries"" was not an option for them. ""We want to raise our children as equal partners and feel that a civil partnership - a modern, symmetrical institution - sets the best example for them,"" they explained.Since March 2014, same sex-couples can choose whether to enter a civil partnership or to marry. This has not been possible for mixed-sex couples, which led Ms Steinfeld and Mr Keidan to argue that the law was discriminatory.This ruling overturns a previous judgement made by the Court of Appeal, which rejected the couple's claim, in February of last year.The judges ruled that current UK law was  ""incompatible"" with human rights laws on discrimination and the right to a private and family life.Announcing the court's decision, Lord Kerr said the government did not seek to justify the difference in treatment between same-sex and different sex couples.""To the contrary, it accepts that the difference cannot be justified,"" he said.LGBT and human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell called the ruling a ""victory for love and equality"".""It was never fair that same-sex couples had two options, civil partnerships and civil marriages, whereas opposite-sex partners had only one option, marriage,"" he said. By BBC legal correspondent, Clive ColemanIt is an irony that the way in which relationship equality for same sex couples came about in the 21st century had the effect of creating inequality between them and different sex couples. The Civil Partnership Act 2004 created civil partnerships but defined them as a 'relationship between two people of the same sex'. When the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013 legalised same sex marriage, gay couples had two options as to how to formalise their relationship in law - marriage or civil partnership - whereas heterosexual couples could only marry.  The Supreme Court has found that inequality to amount to discrimination and a breach of the right to a family life.  The government accepted the inequality between same sex and different sex couples, but argued that it needed to have time to assemble sufficient information to allow a confident decision to be made about the future of civil partnerships.Lord Kerr gave that argument short shrift, saying: ""What it (the government) seeks is tolerance of the discrimination while it sorts out how to deal with it.  That cannot be characterised as a legitimate aim.""The couple will later go to Whitehall to deliver a letter to Equalities Minister Penny Mordaunt.Martin Loat, chairman of the Equal Civil Partnerships campaign, said: ""There is only one possible way forward - giving everyone the right to a civil partnership - and we urge the government to seize this opportunity to announce it will end this injustice now.""More than 130,000 people have signed an online petition in support of civil partnerships for everyone.The couple's barrister Karon Monaghan QC told the court her clients had ""deep-rooted and genuine ideological objections to marriage"" and are ""not alone"" in their views.There are around 63,000 couples in civil partnerships in the UK and some 3.3 million co-habiting couples."
2018-06-27,New women's community prisons plan axed,https://web.archive.org//web/20180627113412/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-44622498,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe government has abandoned plans for five community prisons for women in England and Wales.Instead, the Ministry of Justice will trial five residential centres to help offenders with issues such as finding work and drug rehabilitation.Justice Secretary David Gauke said short custodial sentences had failed to halt the ""cycle of offending"".Campaigners and police bodies have warned the provision for women must be ""properly funded"".Meanwhile, a justice minister has said sentences under a year should be axed for all but the most serious crimes.Rory Stewart told the Commons Justice Select Committee that community penalties were more effective and he wanted to ""significantly reduce, if not eliminate"" terms of under 12 months.Mr Gauke cited figures that 70.7% of women and 62.9% of men released from custody between April and June 2016 after a sentence of less than a year went on to re-offend within 12 months.He said there was ""persuasive evidence"" that the new approach would help reduce re-offending rates.Mothers at the trial residential centres might be able to have their children with them, he added.Analysis: By BBC Home Affairs correspondent Danny ShawThe female offender strategy represents a U-turn from the approach proposed by Liz Truss, when she was justice secretary, that there should be five new community prisons.Partly this is down to money; it costs millions more to build new jails than it does community centres, and at a time when the Ministry of Justice is having to find savings that will have been a key consideration. But the policy also reflects a determination at the department to promote alternatives to locking people up in order to relieve pressure on prisons and reduce reoffending.Ministers say research shows that offenders on community sentences are less likely to commit further crimes than those who've served short jail terms. But the research needs further, careful analysis - because it does not compare like with like: the reoffending figures cover the period an offender spends on a community sentence but do not include the time a prisoner spends in jail.  The government has pledged to spend £5m over two years on ""community provision"" for women.The Association of Police and Crime Commissioners welcomed the change in strategy.But Dame Vera Baird QC, representing the the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners, warned the scheme would only work if properly funded and questioned the MoJ's decision to hand £50m - originally earmarked for the prisons - back to the Treasury.Frances Crook, chief executive of the Howard League for Penal Reform, said ministers deserved ""real praise"" for the change in approach but - like the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners - warned it was ""essential"" that programme was ""properly funded"".Peter Dawson, director of the Prison Reform Trust, said ""thousands"" of women would benefit from the change.He described the strategy as a ""welcome recognition of the futility of short prison sentences"" for women whose offending is often driven by ""unmet mental health needs"".Women serving sentences of less than a year are more likely to re-offend than men with comparable sentences - although they are slightly less likely to re-offend overall.But it's not a straightforward comparison. Women represent just 4.6% of the total prison population of 82,989. And due to the nature of the crimes they commit, which are often less violent, they are much more likely than men to serve short sentences. Last year, 80% of sentences handed to women were a year or less and 25% a month or less, compared with men for whom 66% were sentenced to less than a year and 14% to less than a month. A Ministry of Justice report last year found that these short-term sentences were ""consistently associated with higher rates of proven re-offending"" than other forms of sentencing - that applies to all prisoners, male and female.Part of this is because these very small sentences often do nothing to rehabilitate the problems which might have led to imprisonment in the first place. Studies have found that, in general, women prisoners are more vulnerable which can add to the cycle of re-offending. They are twice as likely to have mental health needs, more likely to have drug problems and to have experienced domestic abuse. And they are less likely to have a job or home to go back to on release. During Tuesday's appearance at the Commons Justice Select Committee, Mr Stewart said although he wanted to scrap short prison terms, there would be cases - such as violent or sexual crimes - where prison terms were justified.The Penrith and The Border MP said: ""My number one priority is to protect the public and I believe that the best way of protecting the public is to significantly reduce, if not eliminate, the under 12-month prison population because people on community sentences are less likely to reoffend than people who are put in prison.""I am not going to be reducing the prison population just to save money.""If somebody ought to be in prison, they ought to be in prison, and then my job is to go to the Treasury and get the money to pay for that prison place."""

However, increasingly people are relying on family and friends or go without care, which includes everything from help with washing and dressing to support in taking medications.Polling carried out by Ipsos Mori as part of the work done by the four leading health think-tanks for the BBC to mark the 70th birthday of the NHS showed only 15% of people thought the current system was fair.Although appetite for a new tax was mixed and only one in four people were in favour of using wealth tied up in people's houses.The MPs on the Housing, Communities and Local Government and Health and Social Care committees said changes were long overdue.A combination of the ageing population and a squeeze on council budgets has left the system at breaking point.The cross-party groups believe only a radical solution can tackle the problem.Their report said employers should also contribute to the social care premium and argues it could be topped up by an extra levy on inheritance tax on the wealthiest estates.The MPs believe it could lead to everyone getting care paid for - although those in care homes would still have to contribute towards their accommodation costs.The committees do not say how much should be levied, acknowledging there would need to be a full review on how much money the system needs.But they said a degree of ""intergenerational fairness"" was needed, given the under-40s as a whole were more likely to be struggling with housing, employment and the cost of living than older generations.They also suggested the money raised could be used to support the care system for younger adults with disabilities, which forms part of the wider social care system.Currently the care provided by councils costs £20bn a year - less than a fifth of the NHS budget.Sarah Wollaston, chair of the Health and Social Care Committee, said: ""We can no longer delay finding a fair and sustainable settlement for social care.""Too many people are being left without the care and support they need and it is time for a decision to be made about how the costs are shared.""The government has said it will be publishing a green paper on social care soon - this is expected in the autumn.A funding rise has recently been agreed for the NHS, which will see its budget increase by £20bn a year by 2023.Ministers have said tax rises will be required to fund this, but the MPs said the levy they are proposing could also contribute towards that.Caroline Abrahams, of Age UK, gave the proposals her backing, saying a ""bold new vision"" was needed.She said while the idea of paying more was a ""bitter pill, it just might be one worth swallowing - but only for a system that we can all rely on."""

Extending the Article 50 process, the two-year legal framework under which the UK is leaving the EU, to allow for more talks would require the approval of the UK government and all 27 other EU members.In a speech at the Chatham House think tank in London, Mr Blair said he believed Brexit ""can and should be stopped"" and criticised the UK's negotiations.""Up to now, the negotiation with Europe has been conducted by civil servants in a state of despair overseen by politicians in a state of denial,"" he said.He said the prime minister was ""more hostage than leader"" because of divisions in her party and the Labour leader is ""neglecting to lead the fight"" ""We should plan now for the possibility we need to extend the March 2019 deadline,"" he said.""Presently, we are drifting... with no clear negotiating position, no resolution of the Northern Ireland question, still vaguely hoping Europe will allow us access to the single market without abiding by its rules, which it will never do.""He likened talk about the prospect of the UK leaving without an agreement - which several cabinet ministers have said must remain an option - to ""holding a negotiation on the top floor of a high-rise building and 'threatening' to jump out of the window if our demands are not met"".Mr Blair also said the EU should recognise people's concerns over issues like migration which he said led to the Brexit vote, claiming a fundamental offer of reform would allow the UK to ""stay with dignity"" inside the bloc.He added: ""The sensible thing - maybe this is too rational a view for today's world - is for Europe to realise that the Brexit vote represented a feeling that is not specifically or exclusively British.""That's what all these elections have shown over the last few months. This is a European-wide feeling, it's just that Britain had the referendum.""Both Mrs May and Mr Corbyn have ruled out another referendum, saying their task is to implement the wishes of the British people, who voted by a majority of 51.9% to 48.1% to leave in the 2016 referendum."

Treasury Select Committee chair Nicky Morgan says she found the details disclosed in a leaked report into the alleged cover-up ""deeply troubling"". The report claims HBOS failed to disclose the fraud before being rescued by Lloyds during the financial crisis.Ms Morgan said the committee will seek ""maximum transparency"".The Lloyds Banking Group internal report - known as Project Lord Turnbull - claimed that since 2007, HBOS had a strategy to conceal a fraud at its Reading office where corrupt bankers forced business customers to take on a firm of so-called turnaround consultants. But instead of being helped, customers ended up ruined. Many lost their livelihoods, their marriages and their health.The report surfaced on the internet last week and was later published by Kevin Hollinrake MP, chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Fair Business Banking. In April, Lloyds Banking Group appointed Dame Linda Dobbs to investigate. However, the bank hasn't committed to making Dame Linda's findings public. MPs are insisting they must be turned over to parliament.Ms Morgan said: ""The fraud at HBOS Reading was a shocking crime that destroyed lives and livelihoods. There are numerous investigations into the events, including the Dame Linda Dobbs Review and an investigation by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).""She said: ""There are deeply troubling allegations raised in the ""Project Lord Turnbull"" report, which are at the heart of Dame Linda's and the FCA's investigations. The committee will consider the findings of this work when it's completed.""In the meantime, we will continue to press for maximum transparency. It is overwhelmingly in the public interest to understand how such a huge criminal fraud was allowed to happen, and why it took so long for it to come to light.""Lloyds said it ""remains determined to get to the bottom of what happened in HBOS Reading and we share the Treasury Committee's desire for transparency"". ""We welcome the statement by Nicky Morgan MP, chair of the Treasury Select Committee. We continue to support the FCA investigation and the separate, independent Dame Linda Dobbs review.""We will, of course, assist the Treasury Select Committee in its consideration of these matters and will fulfil any requests made to us, including provision of Dame Linda's review findings.""The Project Lord Turnbull report was written in 2013 by a senior manager at Lloyds called Sally Masterton who was helping Thames Valley Police with inquiries into the fraud at HBOS's office in Reading.Mrs Masterton came across new information raising concerns about a cover-up of the fraud.After relaying her concerns to a senior executive, who asked her to write-up her findings, Mrs Masterton produced the report. Its executive summary said: ""Concealment set in motion a course of events that has had and continues to have far-reaching and very serious consequences, extending to the Lloyds TSB takeover. LBG is significantly exposed."" After writing a draft report and submitting its front section on 5 September 2013, Mrs Masterton was put on enforced leave on 23 September 2013. In May 2008, the government knew HBOS was running low on cash but wanted to avoid another nationalisation. HBOS executives proposed to raise money from the bank's shareholders to beef up its finances.However, in the prospectus for that fund-raising, which is meant to disclose all material financial information, there was no mention of a fraud. Mrs Masterton found emails showing HBOS executives didn't want to disclose their exposure to ""the Reading incident"" and discussed keeping it comfortably below a limit of 5% of net income from group continuing operations - or £285m.  Later that year Lloyds shareholders were asked to approve the purchase of HBOS.Again, the prospectus mentioned nothing about the fraud - nor about £40bn pounds in ""stressed assets"" - loans where the bank might not get its money back.

When Mr Davies asked his party colleagues to back Wales having more flexibility on income tax than the coalition UK government was offering, some of his AMs rebelled.His pitch for the Senedd election of 2016 included cutting taxes and raising speed limits.But the campaign failed to produce the kind of results that his party had seen the year before in the 2015 general election in Wales, and actually resulted in a loss of seats.In the referendum that came shortly after he decided to back Leave - opposing David Cameron's Remain stance - and ended up being on the winning side.But it was the decision to allow Mark Reckless, the former UKIP AM, to join the party group that sparked rumours of a challenge to Mr Davies that have persisted ever since.Mr Reckless is disliked by many Conservatives for defecting to UKIP before a party conference in 2014 - designed to cause former prime minister David Cameron lasting damage.His inclusion with the Tories in the Senedd caused a storm, spurring internal conflicts both within the group itself and the larger party.MPs queued up to criticise Mr Davies, apparently with the backing of Conservative headquarters.That was followed by anonymous calls from MPs and officials for him to be sacked or removed from office.One source told BBC Wales' Arwyn Jones: ""Water will flow under the bridge before we do anything - but that water will drown Andrew RT Davies.""Obvious threats to his leadership had appeared to ebb away over time, but in reality the animosity that decision generated never went away.Problems between Westminster Tories and Mr Davies also deepened after he fell out with the Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns over who of the two senior Welsh Conservatives should represent their party in 2017 general election debates.As a result of the farce Tory AM Darren Millar ended up taking the helm for the party in the BBC Wales general election debate.The latest big bust-up came just last week, when Mr Davies accused Airbus of making exaggerated threats over the risk of job losses from a no-deal Brexit.Guto Bebb, MP for Aberconwy, said the comments were ""unworthy"" of someone who wanted to be first minister and he said he was not leader of the Welsh Conservatives.His staff have often used the title, citing David Cameron as having bestowed it on him, but it has never been written into the party constitution.Was Mr Bebb's intervention a prelude to moves to push Mr Davies out of the position?"
2018-06-27,Brexit’s grumpy bedfellows,https://web.archive.org//web/20180627113412/https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44627029,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new window""Some regard private enterprise as a predatory tiger to be shot, others look on it as a cow to be milked, only a handful see it for what it really is, the strong and willing horse that pulls the whole cart along.""There are a few business leaders who would quite like to repeat the words of Sir Winston Churchill about the role, as they see it, of business in Britain - if they ever got close enough to a Cabinet minister.Such business leaders see themselves as the willing cart horse, given the extra load of preparing for departure from the European Union, but nevertheless constantly swatted in the face by politicians who complain that they are neighing too loudly or not realising the opportunities obvious in the green fields over the hill.As the deadline approaches for agreeing a deal with the EU over Brexit, sectors which rely on the complex international supply chains made possible by Britain's membership of the single market and the customs union are becoming louder as their private fears ""no deal"" will be the ultimate outcome solidify.For those sectors - such as car making - the efficiency of the ""just in time"" model of production faces an existential threat if there are any delays at border crossing between Britain and the EU.And, out of the customs union and the single market, many businesses say it is at present difficult to see how ""friction-free"" trade can be maintained.I was struck at yesterday's summit held by the car makers trade body, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, just how hostile some in the audience were to Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, who said in a speech that the government was pushing for the best and most ""mutually beneficial"" deal possible with the EU.""We are confident that we will secure a deal that minimises disruption to your businesses,"" Mr Grayling said.John Neil, the chief executive of Unipart, one of Britain's largest automotive parts suppliers, questioned Mr Grayling from the floor, saying the government was sending ""mixed messages"" and that Cabinet ministers apparently responding with an expletive when asked about concerns raised over Brexit, was not exactly helpful.As the transport secretary attempted to respond to another delegate demanding more clarity, he was interrupted with demands to ""answer the question"".It came close to heckling.This goes well beyond any allegations of ""Project Fear Mark II"" and to the heart of the fundamental difference between politics and business over the approach to Brexit.Politicians may expend many warm words about efforts to secure the best deal with the EU and point to the progress so far made.But to businesses, who deal in matters of legality not podium speeches, nothing concrete, nothing signed, has yet been delivered.And as the UK head of BMW told me yesterday, unless that legal certainty is clear by September, then firms like his will have to start spending on the infrastructure necessary for border checks between the EU and Britain.That means large warehouses to hold supplies, lorry parks at ports and new computer systems to deal with customs requirements.All that costs money, Dr Ian Robertson told me, and ultimately that will affect the competitiveness of the UK motor sector and could lead to increased prices for cars.That is the ""evidence"" Greg Clark, the business secretary, referred to at the Times CEO Summit yesterday.Comments in deliberately sharp contrast to the expletive attributed to the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, who, when asked in Parliament if he used strong language, replied that no-one could doubt the government's ""passionate support"" for business.Even, he continued, if he may have expressed rather more ""sceptical"" opinions about those who sought to ""speak for business"" - in this case probably the CBI, the business trade group not thought to be high on Mr Johnson Christmas card list.Businesses which fear the consequences of a disruptive Brexit - and of course that it is not all businesses - are not sure of the government's ""passionate support"" for them.They want legal clarity so that they can prepare for the complicated changes that are likely to be necessary.That clarity is some way off, even under the best case scenarios about how negotiations with the EU will progress before Britain officially leaves the EU at the end of March next year.And until then, the scratchy tone between the cart horse of businesses and an irritable government will become increasingly evident."
2018-06-27,Disruption ahead?,https://web.archive.org//web/20180627113412/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-44617141,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAfter MPs walked out of PMQs, senior SNP MPs say it won't be business as usual at Westminster going forward. So what can we expect?""We don't have as many opportunities as Parnell did...but we're going to make it difficult for them.""So said one senior SNP figure to me last week, as the dust settled after their PMQs walkout.Charles Stewart Parnell, the 19th Century Irish Home Rule activist and MP, was one of Westminster's great disruptors.His ""obstruction"" campaign helped wreck business in the Commons and brought attention to the Irish Home Rule issue. He's commemorated with a bust in the Commons…just outside the SNP group office.Some in the SNP now think they can take a leaf out of his book.The party's MPs think Scottish voices are being sidelined in Brexit talks (something the UK government denies).They were particularly furious when just 19 minutes was set aside for discussion of the devolved aspects of the Withdrawal Bill.The walkout at PMQs, a number have told me, is just the start of a campaign of disruption.The standing orders in the Commons have changed since Parnell's day, as the quote from my source at the start alludes to.His tactic of filibustering to stop legislation being passed is considerably less easy these days, with debates normally time-limited, for example.But the SNP group at Westminster still think there are plenty of opportunities for mischief.The PMQs walkout was prompted after Ian Blackford tried to invoke Standing Order 163 (1), that the Commons should vote on sitting in private.It seems that was deliberately timed to happen during PMQs.The vote didn't take place, but it had been highly disruptive in the middle of the most high-profile event in the parliamentary week.It's a safe bet that those in the SNP whips' office are dusting off their copies of Commons rules to look for more opportunities.For now, they're remaining tight-lipped about what's next. In the words of one source, ""it wouldn't be a surprise if we told you...""Borrowing from Parnell, they could try and slow down the operation of Parliament by raising objections and calling for votes on business that's normally nodded through.But Mr Blackford suggests the focus will be on big occasions and denies suggestions the party is digging the trenches for a Parliamentary ""guerrilla war"".""We've got to do this in a way that's effective,"" he says.""Parliament operates in a different way than it did in Parnell's day... it's about using the current constricts in a way that lets us demonstrate to the government that we are very angry at the way they've treated us.""The main focus is likely to be Brexit legislation - for example the Trade Bill and the Customs Bill, both of which should be back in the Commons soon.Scottish government ministers have made it clear there's next to no chance they'll approve the bills, making them obvious targets.But could the frustration plan extend to other bills too?Take Heathrow. Yesterday the party refused to back expansion, despite firm support from the SNP Scottish government.One MP told me there was more space for such an approach ""in light of recent events"". Another told me it would have been too uncomfortable to vote with the Conservatives in the current climate.Officially, the Westminster party says this was about a lack of guarantees from UK ministers on how benefits for Scotland would be delivered.But UK government sources are convinced it's part of the frustration strategy - and it could backfire. One minister told me: ""First out of the blocks on non-cooperation and the SNP fall on their arse.""They should have chosen an issue that didn't involve hypocrisy. It means all non-cooperation now will be judged less about standing up for Scotland and more about standing up for the SNP."" More broadly, Whitehall sources argue disruption is about independence.They say the SNP is pursuing a ""grievance agenda"" designed to whip up resentment.But a government source told me they think ""people will see it for what it is"".The SNP deny that. But whichever side you agree with, it seems likely there will be more opportunities to discuss the merits of a disruptive approach soon."
2018-06-27,Boris mystery solved?,https://web.archive.org//web/20180627113412/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44606760,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAfghanistan is a long way to go to avoid an embarrassing vote in Parliament. The absence of Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson isn't the only telling thing about the Heathrow debate tonight, which stacks up to be a pretty good snapshot of the odd and confusing place our politics finds itself in at the moment.  The Conservatives officially back the policy but are corralling their MPs very strenuously to make sure they don't lose the vote after a minister resigned. One former cabinet minister told me today the ""whipping operation is ridiculous, they were even making sure I was going to be there"". But collective responsibility as it has traditionally functioned is out of the window. Cabinet ministers seem rather to have given up on trying to agree with each other (Heathrow isn't the only matter where there is very public discord).The Labour Party is opposing a policy tonight when it comes to Heathrow that their main backer and dozens of their MPs actually support. The Lib Dems are sticking to their principles of opposing Heathrow but with their size these days are finding it hard to make much noise about it. And the SNP who have been officially supportive of expanding the airport won't vote because they say they haven't had credible guarantees from the government. Clear? All this on a problem that Westminster has been arguing about for decades. It will pass tonight, but this is only, remember, only, the equivalent of the outline planning permission - gasp. Huge attention in the frothy end of the Westminster bubble has centred on the foreign secretary as - to his colleagues' frustration - it often does. During the first half of the day, much of SW1 engaged in a game of political Where's Wally? Speculation on top of speculation on top of speculation about where Boris Johnson could be. Was he still in his Foreign Office lair? In the air? Hiding in the tearoom of the House of Commons? The one place he was categorically not was chaining himself to bulldozers at Heathrow. Then, in the end, the Afghan foreign ministry gave it away by posting a picture of the foreign secretary and his counterpart together at a meeting in Kabul.The mystery of his whereabouts was solved, but not yet the mystery of the purpose. Afghanistan is not exactly an easy place to head for a quick hello.  Several sources in Westminster tonight suggest there was a serious reason. My colleague Jonathan Beale reported last month that the government was considering sending about 400 more troops to Afghanistan to join the 600 or so already there helping train Afghan forces.  Sources suggest tonight that the National Security Council will discuss the proposal tomorrow afternoon, with the government potentially approving the move, and a possible announcement in the coming days. The soldiers would not be involved in combat, but helping the Afghans provide more security in Kabul. It is suggested an uplift of 440 would make the UK the third biggest contributor in Afghanistan. It is a very long way from the troop numbers during the days of intense conflict. But a move that could give the UK more authority in the run up to a Nato summit at a time when the debate around our future defence is being intensely fought. "

After Mrs May called the snap general election last June, she did not do as well as she'd hoped and ended up without a Commons majority. The Conservatives got 318 seats, four short of the number a prime minister needs (technically it should be 326 seats - half of the overall number of MPs - but Sinn Féin's policy of abstentionism means its MPs do not take their seats). That spelled bad news for Mrs May, as it meant her government could be defeated on crucial Brexit votes during the UK-EU negotiations. In order to get around that, she looked to the DUP and its 10 MPs, to help give her a working majority of 328.At just three pages long, the deal sets out what the DUP agreed to support the Conservatives on, in exchange for financial support for Northern Ireland. It also states that the two parties would set up a coordination committee to oversee how the agreement would work in practice. The deal contains an assurance from the Conservatives that they will ""never be neutral in expressing their support for the union"". It also includes a commitment from the government to uphold the Good Friday, or Belfast Agreement (the 1998 deal that brought 30 years of conflict in Northern Ireland to an end) and a clause that the deal will remain in place for the length of this Parliament (usually five years). There is also a commitment that it will be reviewed by both parties at the end of each parliamentary session.Because it is not in coalition with the Conservatives. Rather, the two sides negotiated the confidence and supply arrangement. In exchange for support on key votes on Brexit, security and budgets, the DUP got money for Northern Ireland as well as the ear of the prime minister. The party negotiated an extra £1bn in spending for Northern Ireland over 2018 and 2019. The deal, however, specified that the DUP is not tied-in to supporting the government on every matter.In the months following, there was concern that the money would only be able to be spent when Stormont was restored. But in March, the government announced that £410m of the £1bn deal would be included in a new Stormont budget with money dished out to various areas. Downing Street has said that so far £430m has been released. In 2017/18, £20m was given to health and education while the £410m allocated for the Stormont budget is currently going through parliamentary approval procedures. Money for health was recently allocated to improve emergency department services in County Down. In April, the government said a consultation would take place to see how the £150m for broadband could best be used. It is understood that it could be 2020 before that investment materialises.Viewed as shrewd negotiators from decades of talks in the Northern Ireland peace process, the DUP also gained guarantees from the Conservatives on a range of policy priorities - such as keeping the guarantee to increase state pensions by at least 2.5% a year, to maintain defence spending, and agriculture spending in Northern Ireland at the same level for the rest of the current parliament (which theoretically takes us to June 2022). Not exactly. The DUP's deep religious roots mean it staunchly opposes abortion and same-sex marriage. When the deal was announced, there was criticism of Mrs May from some of her own MPs who did not want their party to be associated with the DUP's views. South Cambridgeshire MP Heidi Allen told the Commons she could ""barely contain her anger"" at the agreement.  The former Conservative Party chair Lord Patten even described the deal as ""toxic"". Scotland and Wales also expressed concerns that Northern Ireland could get special treatment from the government.When the deal was reached, power-sharing in Northern Ireland had stalled. The DUP-Sinn Féin executive had collapsed six months earlier, after a scandal concerning a flawed green energy scheme. Several rounds of talks chaired by the British government had failed - and when the DUP-Tory deal was announced some argued it had set the process back even further, making it harder for the British government to play its traditional role of neutral mediator. A year on, there's been no restoration of Stormont or implementation of direct rule from Westminster, leaving Northern Ireland in limbo. The government says it is still committed to getting devolution up and running again, but has been criticised by other Stormont parties for being too close to the DUP.While the DUP has stood by its promise to back the government on Brexit votes in the Commons, things were not so rosy last December. Just six months into the arrangement, the DUP threatened mutiny after criticising a proposal between the UK and the EU about the future of the Irish border. The DUP said its red line was any situation where Northern Ireland was treated differently from the rest of the UK. It forced the government to retreat from that plan, and to date, there has not been enough progress on the border question to allow the UK and EU to settle on a way forward. This issue could cause more rifts between the DUP and the Conservatives for some time to come.That depends on who you ask. Technically, it could last as long as the two parties agree to keep the agreement in place. Potentially up until the next general election is called. But coalitions and minority governments, no matter the form they take, are not often thought of as stable settings for governance - particularly in this period with uncertainty around Brexit and the stalemate at Stormont. The DUP's deputy leader Nigel Dodds has insisted that it is ""not a temporary two-year deal"", but Mrs May might not be just as confident."
2018-06-27,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20180627113412/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks  are now focusing on the detail of those issues and on future relations - after agreement was reached on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree within six months on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide, but first let's go back to the basics...It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.1% in the first three months of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.4%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand near a 40-year year low of 4.2%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 4.2% in the year to March 2018, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues. The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May was now put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. It will end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain-supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each playing roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanAn agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pounds buy fewer euros. A slump in the value of the dollar means the exchange rate with the pound is pretty close to where it was before the referendum.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.The UK has proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.A method for calculating the bill has been agreed, but the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more.The question of how and when payments will be made still needs to resolved, but it will be a schedule lasting for many years to come, and it is highly unlikely that anyone will ever be able to give an exact figure for the size of the divorce bill.UK sources say it will be up to £40bn, but some EU sources expect it to be higher than that. No-one can say for sure, and both sides want to keep it that way.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 6.5% in 2016 to 2.7% in 2017, according to the Halifax. It said the slowdown was driven by a squeeze on real wage growth.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-06-27,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180627113412/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to £840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

On the two previous occasions in 1970 and February 1974 the PM and the party lost office. While there is no other conceivable administration in the new parliament other than a Conservative-led one, it remains to be seen whether the PM will retain her position. However, so long as the Conservatives can reach an accommodation with the DUP they will have a working majority in the House of Commons.  BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed:When the general election exit poll was revealed at 10pm, the pound immediately dropped by 2% as investors took a position that a hung parliament was a possible outcome of the general election.Why would that cause the currency to decline? Because a hung parliament means that the government's direction of travel would be less certain.

What happens to the Irish border remains a sticking point.The UK says both sides want to see a ""faster pace"" in talks.But Prime Minister Theresa May has been unable to say much new at this summit - the last one before October - because she has yet to get her cabinet to agree on a blueprint for the UK's future relationship with the EU. They are due to meet at Chequers next Friday, in what has been billed as a make-or-break meeting. Mrs May has said the UK will then publish a White Paper setting out ""in more detail what strong partnership the United Kingdom wants to see with the European Union in the future"".Chancellor Angela Merkel said Mrs May would ""come to Germany and we will have a longer debate on this"", once the proposals were published.At the close of the summit, Mr Tusk told reporters there was a ""great deal of work ahead"" on Brexit and the ""most difficult tasks are still unresolved"". ""Quick progress"" was needed if a deal was to be reached at the next summit.""This is the last call to lay the cards on the table,"" he said.He was one of a string of EU chiefs demanding more clarity from the UK prime minister, who left the summit before the 27 other EU leaders discussed Brexit together on Friday.European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said the British had to ""make clear their position"" adding: ""We cannot go on to live with a split cabinet. They have to say what they want and we will respond to that.""EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier warned: ""The time is very short"" and that while progress had been made, ""huge and serious divergence remains, in particular on Ireland and Northern Ireland"".  He also said he hoped to see ""workable and realistic"" proposals from the UK on what the future relationship between the UK and EU should look like.He said he was ""ready to invite the UK delegation to come back to Brussels next Monday"" to continue working on a deal.BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said she understood that UK officials had already informed the EU Commission they would not hold talks on Monday and the ""mini row over diaries"" revealed ""how tetchy things are"".Tensions revealed sometimes by tiny things - I hear Commission asked UK for talks next week, UK said no, so Barnier then invited them again in front of the camerasEnd of Twitter post  by @bbclaurakEuropean leaders at the summit welcomed progress on the legal text of the withdrawal agreement but noted that ""important aspects still need to be agreed"" including the territorial application of the deal ""notably as regards Gibraltar"".  Talks between Spain and the UK over Gibraltar, including access to its airport and the exchange of tax information, continue. They also expressed concern that ""no substantial progress has yet been achieved on agreeing a backstop solution for Ireland/Northern Ireland"", if a deal on customs arrangements is not agreed by December 2020. when the transition period is due to end.And they called on member states and EU institutions ""to step up their work on preparedness at all levels and for all outcomes"" - the European Commission president has said the EU must prepare for the possibility that no Brexit deal will be reached.Mrs May's own cabinet is divided over what the UK's customs arrangements after December 2020 should look like, when the transition period agreed with the EU is due to end. And there are disagreements over the future movement of goods and people across the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.On Thursday, Mrs May said a strong future partnership with the EU was in everyone's interests.""I think both sides are keen to continue that work at a faster pace than we have done up till now and certainly we would welcome that,"" she said.She added that the UK would publish a White Paper setting out ""in more detail [the] strong partnership the United Kingdom wants to see with the European Union in the future"".But she urged fellow EU leaders to tell their negotiators the UK should be allowed to continue to take part in schemes like the Prum mechanism for sharing DNA profiles, the Second Generation Schengen Information System - a database of ""real time"" alerts about certain individuals - and the European Criminal Records Information System.Without UK participation in such schemes, she suggested their collective ability to fight terrorism would be reduced."
2018-06-28,EU leaders plan secure migrant centres,https://web.archive.org//web/20180629142844/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-44652846,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowSecure centres for migrants may be set up in EU states to process asylum claims under a deal reached after marathon talks at a summit in Brussels.The controlled centres would be set up by EU states on a voluntary basis and migrants whose claims were rejected would be ""returned"".Refugees could be resettled in EU states which agreed to take them.The deal follows weeks of diplomatic wrangling over migrant rescue ships, and which country should take them in.Coastguard officials said on Friday that around 100 people were thought to have drowned off the Libyan coast, with 14 rescued.They were found in waters to the east of the capital, Tripoli.There were no details on which countries might set up the secure centres or take in refugees, but French President Emmanuel Macron said they would be in countries where migrants first arrived in the EU. ""We have struck the right balance between responsibility and solidarity,"" he said.Numbers illegally entering the EU have dropped 96% since their 2015 peak, the European Council says. Italy - the entry point for thousands of migrants, mainly from Africa - had threatened to veto the summit's entire agenda if it did not receive help.""After this European summit, Europe is more responsible and offers more solidarity,"" said Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte. ""Today Italy is no longer alone.""Other leaders struck a more cautious note.German Chancellor Angela Merkel said more needed to be done to resolve disagreements.And European Council President Donald Tusk said it was ""too early to talk about a success"".""We have managed to reach an agreement in the European Council. But this is in fact the easiest part of the task, compared to what awaits us on the ground when we start implementing it,"" he told a news conference.By Adam Fleming, BBC News, BrusselsA few things stand out as wins for Italy's new prime minister. The summit's conclusions now include a statement about the need for boats that pick up migrants in the Mediterranean to respect international law. But the big one is approval of the concept of closed, secure processing facilities for migrants arriving in the EU. Some say this will make it easier to send back people whose claims for asylum are rejected. Others are already describing them as prisons. This paragraph is full of caveats, commas and sub-clauses - all the hallmarks of something drafted in the middle of the night. Another striking pledge is for an ambitious partnership with Africa. That's the EU trying to balance its tough internal approach with a friendly external one, and offering incentives to North African countries to host facilities where migrants can be assessed for resettlement in Europe.  The 28 EU leaders also agreed several other measures:Mr Conte had earlier taken the rare step of blocking the conclusions of the joint communiqué until the leaders had settled the migration issue. Both Italy and Greece want other countries to share the burden.However several Central European states have so far rejected an EU scheme to relocate 160,000 refugees from overcrowded camps in Greece and Italy.German Chancellor Angela Merkel had said that the migration issue could be a defining moment for the EU - but she also needed the summit to avert a political crisis at home that could bring down her government. Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, from her Bavarian coalition partner the CSU, had given her a deadline of this weekend. He has threatened to start turning away migrants who have already registered elsewhere from the border in his home state.Without the CSU, Mrs Merkel would lose her parliamentary majority.After the talks, she acknowledged the EU still had ""a lot of work to do to bridge the different views"".About 56,000 migrants have arrived in Europe so far this year, the International Organization for Migration says. More than a million people arrived in 2015.This month's tensions over migrant rescue ships barred from entry to Italian ports - most recently German charity ship Lifeline - have put the issue firmly back in the EU spotlight.The Lifeline was only allowed to dock in Malta after intense diplomacy among several EU states, who each agreed to take some of the migrants on board. Malta said Norway had now also agreed to take a share.Medical charity Medecins Sans Frontières (MSF) branded the new EU deal inhumane. ""The only thing European states appear to have agreed on is to block people at the doorstep of Europe regardless of how vulnerable they are, or what horrors they are escaping - and to demonise non-governmental search and rescue operations,"" MSF's emergencies chief Karline Kleijer said."

The airfields are due to be sold off, mostly for housing, over the next six years as part of MoD cost-cutting.MPs and peers on the all-party general aviation group say they are an important national asset.They say that Defence Minister Tobias Ellwood had agreed to ""look again"" at the aerodrome sell-offs.But all-party group chairman, Conservative MP Grant Shapps, said there were ""significant disparities"" between what Mr Ellwood had said and his subsequent follow-up letter to the group.""Our meeting with the defence minister was very worthwhile and extracted some helpful commitments, including supporting continued aviation use at the 15 military aerodromes being disposed of, where possible,"" said Mr Shapps. He said the group's members were ""very concerned to see no mention of these commitments in the minister's follow-up letter"".""As we celebrate 100 years of the Royal Air Force, which has inspired generations of young people into pursuing high-tech jobs in aviation, we have written back to the minister to ask specifically what the Ministry of Defence is doing to support general aviation. ""We look forward to the minister's reply.""The MPs and peers argue that the 15 airfields should be kept in use for private planes, gliders and flight training - known as general aviation - and to be kept in reserve for military use, in the event of a national emergency. In his written response, Mr Ellwood appeared to rule out the future use of the threatened airfields by other aircraft.He said he ""recognised the strength of feeling"" among the 157 members of the all-party aviation group.But he said private planes could still access 20 other military airfields in the UK and the closure of aerodromes used for pilot training was part of a plan to increase training capacity by concentrating it at fewer sites.He also rejected arguments that closing the airfields posed a security risk. ""I must assure you that the MoD does undertake the necessary investigative work to ensure that the safety and security of service personnel and UK citizens is not compromised,"" said the minister.The MoD said the sites were ""surplus to military requirements"" and as no bids have been received to turn them into civilian airfields they would be used to meet the ""needs of the local community"".A spokesperson said: ""Some of the airfields have not been active for decades, years if not decades, and are not fit for aircraft to land.""All proceeds from the sale of the sites will be reinvested back into defence.""The airfields earmarked for closure are:"

In the report published on Friday, MPs and peers on the Joint Committee on Human Rights said the Home Office demonstrated a ""wholly incorrect approach to case-handling and to depriving people of their liberty"".Individuals were locked up unless they could satisfy officials they should not be detained - an approach with the report described as ""simply unlawful"".""It is for the Home Office to satisfy itself that it has a power to detain an individual - not for an individual to have to satisfy the Home Office that they should not be detained,"" the report said.The report added: ""The Home Office required standards of proof from members of the Windrush generation which went well beyond those required, even by its own guidance; and moreover were impossible for them to meet - and which would have been very difficult for anyone to meet.""This led to officials making perverse decisions about their status. Moreover, it seems that if those standards were not met, Home Office officials then considered that they had grounds to detain.""The committee examined two cases of Windrush migrants - Anthony Bryan, 60, and Paulette Wilson, 62  - who were both detained after being unable to show documents proving their immigration status.Mr Bryan and Ms Wilson both came to Britain from Jamaica as children in the 1960s. Giving evidence to the committee in May, Mr Bryan agreed with a suggestion that a factor in the way he was treated was because he was black.Grandfather Mr Bryan was held in a detention centre twice, for almost three weeks, last year while Ms Wilson was detained for a week.The committee said their experience in detention was ""traumatising and debilitating"".The case files showed that immigration officials dismissed ""ample information and evidence"" for the pair's right to be in the UK, the report said. Some of the evidence discounted by officials included their own accounts of their lives as well as testimonies from family members, people who had known them for decades and lawyers.The report said that detention powers should not be used for people living in the UK and who are unlikely to abscond, the report said.""Detention powers have been used unlawfully and inappropriately by the Home Office without assuring itself that it had a right to deprive individuals of their liberty,"" it said. ""There should be fundamental change in the law, culture and procedures to protect human rights in the work of the Home Office.""Harriet Harman, the committee chairwoman, said what had happened to Mr Bryan and Ms Wilson had been ""a total violation of their human rights by the state's most powerful government department"".She said some members of the Windrush generation had been treated ""shockingly"" and ""shamefully"" and she called for additional safeguards to be put in place.""What you've got to have is a system which allows - when something's going wrong - the individual to check it and there to be proper monitoring,"" she told Radio 4's Today.""There's no independent situation at all. So you've got Home Office officials literally ticking the box for somebody to be detained.""The inquiry rejected the Home Office's claim that the treatment of Mr Bryan and Ms Wilson was due to a ""a series of mistakes"". It said the explanation was not ""credible of sufficient"" and that a ""systemic failure"" is more likely the reason.The scandal led to the resignation of Home Secretary Amber Rudd and the promise from Theresa May of compensation where appropriate.Earlier this month, more than 2,000 people attended a thanksgiving service marking 70 years since the arrival of Caribbean migrants on the Windrush ship.The migrants were among the first to be recruited to rebuild post-war Britain.In 1971, all Commonwealth citizens already living in the UK were given indefinite leave to remain.There are now 500,000 people resident in the UK who were born in a Commonwealth country and arrived before 1971 - including the Windrush arrivals - according to estimates by Oxford University's Migration Observatory.Earlier this month, Home Secretary Sajid Javid pledged a ""fresh look"" at rules and said key parts of the UK's immigration policy will be reviewed."

She said EU leaders should tell their negotiators to allow the UK to continue to take part in schemes like the Prum mechanism for sharing DNA profiles, the Second Generation Schengen Information System - a database of ""real time"" alerts about certain individuals - and the European Criminal Records Information System.She urged them to ""consider what is in the best interests of the safety of your citizens and mine and give your negotiators a mandate that will allow us to achieve this crucial objective.""BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said Mrs May hoped to persuade the 27 other EU leaders to move away from what the UK government regards as a rigid approach from the EU Commission in negotiations and to ease up on their ""red lines"". By the BBC's political editor Laura KuenssbergThe UK is eager for the EU to become more flexible. To move away from what the government regards as a rigid approach from the EU Commission.At dinner on Thursday night there's a chance for her to persuade the other leaders to loosen that approach.Only they can tell their negotiators to ease up on their red lines.In return for that request, she'll promise that the UK will be able to agree on its blueprint for the future relationship between the UK and EU, at a meeting of her cabinet next week.With almost daily skirmishes at home - that could prove optimistic.Read Laura's full blogEarlier this month EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said the UK would be kicked out of the European Arrest Warrant deal after Brexit - which allows EU members to request the arrest and detention of criminals in other countries without extradition talks between them. He argued it could not remain a part of it because the UK wanted to leave the European Court of Justice and free movement rules.The prime minister has been briefing EU leaders at a summit for the last time before October, when both sides hope a deal will be done on the UK's March 2019 departure.But the European Commission president suggested UK cabinet splits were making things more difficult.Arriving at the summit in Brussels, Jean-Claude Juncker said: ""I don't have to lecture Theresa May, but I would like our British friends to make clear their position.""We cannot go on to live with a split cabinet. They have to say what they want and we will respond to that.""The prime minister, who has been under pressure within her own party, has called her cabinet together for a meeting at Chequers on 6 July to agree the UK's blueprint for its future relations with the EU.Arriving in Brussels, Mrs May said she was looking forward to ""securing our strong future partnership"" which she said was in the interests of both the EU and UK .""I think both sides are keen to continue that work at a faster pace than we have done up till now and certainly we would welcome that.""The prime minister has been holding a number of face-to-face meetings with European counterparts on day one of the two-day summit, which is focused on the migration challenges facing Europe and eurozone reform.The remaining 27 EU leaders are due to discuss Brexit on their own on Friday morning, by which point Mrs May is expected to have left Brussels."
2018-06-28,Police called 'every day' to NHS violence,https://web.archive.org//web/20180629142844/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-44630481,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowPolice are called to at least one violent incident against NHS staff each day on average, figures have suggested. Statistics from four health boards showed officers were called 521 times in 2017/18 and 2,719 times since 2013.One nurse said she struggled to pass a street in Newport where she was attacked by a patient's husband on a home visit.She spoke out as a bill to double the sentence for assaults on emergency workers was discussed in Parliament.In total, there were more than 7,900 incidents of physical or verbal assault against Welsh NHS staff in the year to March - suggesting on any given day, 20 workers face abuse.Jane Carroll, a senior Royal College of Nursing (RCN) officer, who was attacked while out on a home visit said calling the police was not taken lightly.""He was circling me and shouting at me and as I opened the door two hands came very hard on my back. I fell over and took the skin off my knees,"" she said. ""I sat in my car and cried for a little while but realised I couldn't stay there because I felt vulnerable.""""When you go into your shift you don't expect to have to deal with the police,"" she added. ""It's not appropriate to have that disruption, but to do what you have to do, sometimes you have to call on them.""On Friday, a private members bill launched by Rhondda Labour MP Chris Bryant was given its second reading in the House of Lords, having passed a major hurdle by getting the backing of the UK government and being passed by the Commons.If approved by the Lords and brought into law later this year, it would see the maximum prison sentence for a common assault double from six months to one year, if the victim is a firefighter, police officer, search and rescue volunteer, or NHS worker.It would will also apply to prison officers, and to anyone who is attacked while assisting an emergency worker.Ms Carroll said she often has to support RCN members who have experienced violence on the job.""I think it's a sad a sign of the times that we need a bill from Chris Bryant to address this behaviour,"" she added. ""We also have to realise the impact this has on the relationship between health workers and the patient. It's not good.""Last week the Welsh Ambulance Service said it was considering giving body cameras to paramedics after a spike in ambulance staff being attacked.And Home Office data indicates police forces in Wales reported 950 assaults on officers in 2016/17, while latest figures from Wales' three fire services indicate firefighters were attacked almost 145 in the last five years."
2018-06-28,UK 'knew US mistreated detainees',https://web.archive.org//web/20180629142844/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-44640086,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe UK tolerated ""inexcusable"" treatment of US detainees after the 9/11 attacks, MPs have found.The Intelligence and Security Committee said British agencies continued to supply intelligence to allies despite knowing or suspecting abuse in more than 200 cases.Committee chairman Dominic Grieve said agencies knew of incidents that were ""plainly unlawful"".The findings have sparked fresh calls for an independent, judge-led inquiry.The two parliamentary reports, published following a three-year investigation, examine how far Britain's intelligence agencies were aware of the mistreatment of terrorism suspects.The ISC said it was ""beyond doubt"" that the UK knew how the US handled some detainees and rejected claims by intelligence agencies that the cases detailed were no more than ""isolated incidents"".But the committee found no ""smoking gun"" to suggest a policy of deliberately overlooking such cases.Lord Falconer, who served as Labour's lord chancellor at the time, told the BBC that the UK government failed to act quickly enough after learning of British complicity in torture. Prime Minister Theresa May said British personnel worked in ""a new and challenging operating environment"" which some were ""not prepared"" for. She added ""it took too long to recognise that guidance and training for staff was inadequate"", and said British intelligence and the Army were ""much better placed to meet that challenge"".Speaking to the BBC's World at One, committee chairman Dominic Grieve said UK renditions were organised to countries ""with very dubious human rights records, where it would have been very likely that the person would be in fact tortured or ill-treated"".He said British agents working in the US reported concerns about behaviour by their American colleagues, but there ""was no response at the London end"" and ""no questions were asked"" until 2004.The reports come a month after the UK government issued an unprecedented apology to Abdul Hakim Belhaj and his wife, who say they were abducted and taken to Libya after a tip-off from MI6.Mr Belhaj, a Libyan dissident, was tortured and spent six years in prison. Speaking on Thursday, Mr Belhaj's lawyer Sapna Malik said there seemed to be a ""real deference"" to the US.""In a way, this report shows that that [Belhaj case] was not an individual, isolated case, there was a wider pattern of co-operation by the UK,"" she said.The report showed no evidence of direct mistreatment by British intelligence agencies, but there were 13 cases where spies witness first-hand a detainee being mistreated by others, BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera said.Former Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, who was responsible for overseeing GCHQ and MI6 between 2001 and 2006, said he was not aware of the activities or approach of the agencies, adding: ""Many lessons... have since been learnt"".Ken Clarke, who chairs the parliamentary group on extraordinary rendition, renewed calls for an independent inquiry into the UK's role, ""to get to the full truth"".He said the ISC report's findings were ""not small issues which can now be swept under the carpet - and the government must address them urgently"".Speaking to BBC's Newsnight programme, Lord Falconer said: ""We took much too long as a country to work out what our red lines were."" He called for the inquiry into UK complicity in torture overseas to be reopened. Labour's shadow attorney general, Baroness Chakrabarti, and human rights campaign group Reprieve also called for a judge-led inquiry, saying the ISC's report was too limited. Baroness Chakrabarti said in the period after 9/11 the US was ""dabbling in these most horrific practices and - to some extent - the UK government went along for the ride"".The ISC launched its investigation after plans for the independent judge-led Gibson Inquiry collapsed. It studied documents, interviewed former detainees and three ex-officials.But the government denied the committee access to officers who were involved at the time of the UK's involvement in rendition, the report says.By Dominic Casciani, BBC home affairs correspondentToday's ISC reports come six years after a judge-led inquiry was scrapped and court battles failed to get to the bottom of all allegations that the UK got its hands dirty after 9/11. But did the committee get to the whole truth? By its own account, probably not, because it was barred from speaking to some key officers - and it can't entirely establish whether all lessons have been learnt. Today, if a foreign agency is known to be torturing a detainee of interest to the British intelligence agencies, ministers must be informed - that is guidance that has been published.These new rules are being consulted more than 570 times a year - but the ISC doesn't know how many of those cases are being flagged to ministers. Secondly, the ISC was astonished there is still no policy on whether and how UK personnel can be involved in rendition. Ken Clarke was the justice secretary who scrapped the original judge-led inquiry when new allegations of criminality took legal priority. Today he's called for a new inquiry - and other critics have long said that any alternative investigation will never uncover all the wrongdoing.  British citizen Moazzam Begg, previously held in Guantanamo Bay, criticised the inquiry's scope as inadequate, saying ""we still don't know the process of accountability"".Speaking about his own detention, he said British agents ""were there watching as I was hooded, shackled, with a gun to my head"" and claimed they knew he had been led to believe his wife was being tortured.The ISC report said in one case, Ethiopia-born UK resident Binyam Mohamed was held in Pakistan in 2002 - and that MI5 and MI6 were informed by US agents he had been subjected to sleep deprivation. The report said MI5 failed to act on that information before its own officer arrived to interview Mr Mohamed. The US then secretly moved Mr Mohamed to Morocco, where he was tortured. MI5 asked its American allies what was happening to him - but was rebuffed.Despite this, the ISC report says, the agencies gave questions to the US to be put to him. Mr Mohamed was later returned to the UK. Rendering or rendition involves sending a person from one country to another for imprisonment and interrogation, probably by methods such as torture, that would be illegal in the country doing the rendering.US intelligence agencies used the process of ""extraordinary rendition"" to send terror suspects for interrogation by security officials in other countries, where they have no legal protection or rights under American law."
2018-06-28,How do the UK's partners see Brexit and the EU summit?,https://web.archive.org//web/20180629142844/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-44603650,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe EU summit on Thursday and Friday will discuss a number of pressing issues, including migration, economics, security and Brexit. But what do different countries want from the Brussels talks and where does Brexit stand in their priorities?It's tempting to imagine what Angela Merkel and Theresa May might say to one another in a private moment on the margins of the summit. Both leaders, after all, face dissent and open rebellion from within their own ranks. And both are in a bind over borders. But that's exactly why it's unlikely that the German chancellor will pay much attention to Brexit this week. She's far too busy trying to realise her long-promised European migration strategy - and saving her own political skin. Her fragile government hangs precariously in the balance.And it could fall apart if she can't return home with a solution strong enough to see off the rebellion from her interior minister - and coalition partner - who's threatening to unilaterally impose greater migration controls at the German border. In such serious times here, the problem of Brexit seems far a less significant issue to preoccupied lawmakers. But it's not that Germany isn't interested. Industry - in particular the mighty car manufacturing lobby - is beside itself at the thought of a no-deal Brexit. In recent days, Joachim Lang, the director general of the Federation of German Industries, warned that the UK is ""hurtling towards a disorderly Brexit"". He added that only by remaining in the customs union and single market can the Irish border question be answered. Most here want more clarity from Britain about how it perceives its future relationship with the EU, but Mrs May will encounter strong resistance to any proposals that even hint at the reinstatement of a border.  Mrs Merkel, on the other hand, whose experience was shaped by her own early life behind the Iron Curtain in East Germany, now finds herself in an EU openly discussing how and where to strengthen - or even reimpose - Europe's boundaries. France is going into this summit with two concerns uppermost in its mind.  The first is President Macron's beloved long-term project to tie the eurozone economies more closely together. The German chancellor seems to have finally agreed in principle to a watered-down version of his plan, including a common budget for the eurozone and extra measures to help countries facing a recession, though the details are still vague. This summit will be a chance to put their ideas to the other EU countries.The other issue dominating French minds is migration.  President Macron angered Italy earlier this month by saying it was ""irresponsible"" and ""cynical"" to refuse a rescue ship carrying illegal migrants. Italy accused France of hypocrisy, in return.  The issue of how to relieve pressure on the front-line states in Europe's migrant crisis is divisive. In 2015, the former French government promised to take 30,000 refugees from Greece and Italy, but a year later little more than 1,000 had arrived.  And while the French government backs proposals for closed processing centres in front-line states, it does not want to see them on French territory.With all this occupying French minds, there's little room to devote much attention to Brexit.  France has stuck pretty firmly to the EU line of ""no cherry-picking"", saying that freedom of goods, services and people cannot be separated.  But there are those in Paris who believe that appetite is growing to find wiggle room on frictionless goods trading, to protect French exporters to the UK. Though there's little indication that Paris will budge on the issue of a ""passport"" for the City of London and its financial services. Spain's new prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, has made clear he intends to respect commitments his country has made to the EU and the European project in general. But with a range of other issues occupying his agenda - particularly increasing numbers of migrants reaching Spanish shores and tensions in Catalonia - Brexit is not a main priority for the socialist premier. However, he will not be able to ignore the impact the UK's exit could have on Gibraltar, whose British ownership Spain disputes. At the summit, Mr Sánchez is expected to report on the status of recent negotiations between London and Madrid over Gibraltar's future status. Those talks, due to conclude by October, have focused on the possible shared use of the rock's airport and the exchange of tax information on citizens. The EU has agreed that Spain can veto a Brexit accord if it is unhappy with the arrangements for Gibraltar. The summit might offer clues as to whether or not Mr Sánchez intends to continue with the relatively tough line on Gibraltar pursued by the previous Spanish government. Either way, he will want to shore up support from his EU partners on the issue.To Italy's new populist government, Brexit is a rather distracting sideshow. It wants to do business with a post-EU UK and it wants to ensure that the rights of Italian citizens living in the UK are protected. But beyond that, Italy's main preoccupation is migration across the Mediterranean. In this respect, the country has two main objectives: to get EU countries to share the burden of sheltering those who've already reached this continent, and to prevent any more migrants from making the sea journey to Europe.In particular, Italy wants to get rid of the EU's Dublin Regulation, which calls for migrants to be screened in the first place in which they arrive. Italy believes that this places far too much pressure on front-line countries, including Spain and Greece. But Italy may face resistance from fellow populist governments in central and eastern Europe, who do not want to take in any more migrants.Italy's influential Interior Minister, Matteo Salvini, also wants the EU to accept an Italian-Libyan plan announced on 25 June to set up migrant holding centres on Libya's southern borders. In theory, migrants from Africa would be directed to these centres, and prevented from making the journey across the Mediterranean. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban goes into this European summit in confident, but cautious mood. He feels he's winning the argument on migration, but he knows he hasn't won it yet. Brexit, for him, is already yesterday's story. His arch-enemy, Angela Merkel, looks wounded. The new government in Rome shares his anti-immigrant rhetoric, as does the government in Vienna. He can count on Sebastian Kurz, the Austrian Chancellor, to beat the anti-migrant drum for the next six months, as Austria holds the rotating EU presidency. His allies in Bavaria, Horst Seehofer's CSU, are on the warpath. And the other Visegrad countries are right behind him. But Mr Orban is playing for time - he sees his real chance after next year's European parliamentary elections, when he counts on a much bigger role for populist parties like his own, and populist leaders like himself, in the running of the European Union. In the meantime, he still has to face annoying distractions, like criticism in the European Parliament for his crackdown on human rights groups. He'll be hoping the summit is over as quickly as possible, so he can get back to watching the football. He hasn't missed a match yet, he told Hungarian radio. "

At an event in Sarn, near Bridgend, on Friday Mr Irranca-Davies called for the development of ""an integrated Early Childhood Education and Care provision"" which is ""universally available to every child in Wales wherever they may be"".He said the current pilot schemes, offering 30 hours of childcare to children in select parts of Wales, were ""only part of the longer-term vision"".Universal pre-school provision ""helps address the impacts of poverty and narrows the attainment gap when children start school"", he said.Speaking on the Good Morning Wales programme on Friday morning, the former MP said: ""The reason that I'm standing is because people have expressed an interest in nominating me and that's good - I wouldn't be doing it otherwise.""But Mr Irranca-Davies urged fellow Labour assembly members against being too hasty making further nominations.""I do think it's very, very important that if we rush to simply locking down the process before the nominations even open [in September] then we are going to miss a great opportunity here for the Labour Party 20 years on from devolution to actually renew itself, to decide what those ideas and that vision is,"" he said.He summed up his political philosophy as being about ""doing the right thing and being willing to be bold and sometimes, I have to say, to challenge ourselves as well"".While at least four AMs are eyeing up their chances of succeeding Carwyn Jones it's far from certain that everyone who wants to stand will be able to. As things stand, a candidate needs the support of six AMs (including themselves) for their name to appear on the ballot paper. So far, only the Finance Secretary Mark Drakeford has reached that threshold although the Health Secretary Vaughan Gething is only one short. Neither Mr Irranca-Davies nor another announced candidate Eluned Morgan appear close to crossing the line. However, with the party holding a special conference in September to review the rules of the contest, the nominations threshold could well be altered.Mr Irranca-Davies and Ms Morgan appear to believe that if they mount effective campaigns the nominations may take care of themselves. It's a gamble that other Labour AMs are weighing up before deciding whether or not to throw their own hats into the ring."

They have to say what they want and we will respond to that.""Asked if talks could end in no deal, Mr Juncker said: ""We are preparing for different scenarios - on the proper withdrawal agreement but, in parallel, we are working on the no deal.""The prime minister, who has been under pressure at home within her own party, has called her cabinet together for what has been billed as a make-or-break meeting at Chequers on 6 July to agree the UK's blueprint for its future relations with the EU. Arriving in Brussels, Mrs May said she was looking forward to ""securing our strong future partnership"" which she said was in the interests of both the EU and UK .""I think both sides are keen to continue that work at a faster pace than we have done up till now and certainly we would welcome that.""She added that the UK would publish a White Paper setting out ""in more detail what strong partnership the United Kingdom wants to see with the European Union in the future"".Mrs May said it was in everyone's interests that a new partnership on economic and security matters be agreed.Cabinet divisions over the UK's customs arrangements after December 2020, when the transition period agreed with the EU is due to end, have yet to be resolved, as have arguments over the future movement of goods and people across the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.

""I expect EU leaders to send a strong message to the UK that negotiations with the taskforce need to intensify.""The EU's negotiator Michel Barnier has said ""serious divergences"" remain over the question of backstop arrangements for the Irish border if neither of the UK's proposed customs proposals are deemed workable. Elsewhere, Mrs May will seek to show solidarity with the rest of Europe in their efforts to deal with illegal migrant flows across the Mediterranean from Africa and the Middle East.The issue has divided Europe for more than two years but tensions have increased since the election of a populist government in Italy, which has pledged to crack down on unlawful migration, and growing political uncertainty in Germany amid a backlash against Chancellor Angela Merkel's immigration policies.Mrs May is expected to stress the need to tackle the problem of people smuggling at its source, citing the success of a project in Nigeria where once the dangers of crossing the Mediterranean were explained to people, their attitudes to illegal working in the UK changed.On security, the prime minister will call for collective action against misinformation, cyber warfare and money laundering by ""hostile states"" such as Russia. One example of this, she will say, is the UK's sharing of details of Russian intelligence officers expelled after the attacks on Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury with EU allies.The working dinner coincided with England's final World Cup group game against Belgium, whose prime minister Charles Michel was also present. The UK's permanent representative in Brussels couldn't say how much of the match Mrs May, who on Wednesday ordered St George's flags to be flown above No 10 for remaining England games, would see."

Mrs May says she wants a positive trading relationship with the EU after Brexit, and to keep the door open to highly skilled EU migrants. Perhaps that will include Belgian footballers.A few hours later, just as the teams were kicking off, Theresa May gave an England shirt to the Belgian PM.May has never shown much of an interest in football but she certainly knows her cricket, as she showed in an interview with BBC Test Match special last year.There is nothing new about politicians trying to capitalise on sporting success - but Brexit may have given things an extra edge.Irish PM Leo Varadkar, whose country failed to qualify for Russia after losing to Denmark in a play-off, told the BBC he wanted the Red Devils to win, not the Three Lions, on Thursday.Nigel Farage never misses an opportunity to fly the flag, or visit the pub, so it was no surprise to see pictures of him watching the England game at a Brussels bar.But when he draped himself in an England flag, handed to him by a friend, the Beer Factory bar, next door to the European Parliament, erupted in boos, according to The Daily Mirror. and European Parliament staff on a nearby table whipped out an EU flag.Then there is the generic ""come on England"" tweet, which seems straightforward enough, unless individual players are co-opted into the message.The Conservative Party's official Twitter account posted this just before the Belgium game:The two men pictured are Manchester United's Jesse Lingard, who scored against Panama, and Manchester City's Raheem Sterling.Jesse Lingard's political views are unknown. But three years ago, Raheem Sterling recorded a video pledging his support to Labour's Dawn Butler. Butler, a close ally of Jeremy Corbyn, was running to be re-elected as an MP in the part of North West London where Sterling grew up.The Labour leader is a football fan - he even presented EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier with an Arsenal shirt last year.But he was accused of making his own World Cup gaffe, sharing a quote by former Liverpool manager Bill Shankly ahead of England's game against Tunisia. As many on Twitter were quick to point out, Shankly was perhaps not the ideal person to provide pre-match inspiration for the England football team.The Scottish legend once said about playing for his country: ""It's fantastic. You look down at your dark blue shirt, and the wee lion looks up at you and says 'Get out after the English...!'""Some political World Cup slip-ups are a little more subtle. While the basic rules of football are familiar to just about everyone, using the wrong footballing phrase can give the game away.Conservative MP Nick Boles threw his support behind a campaign by the Sun newspaper to fly the St George's flag above government departments during England matches.But as any football fan will know, the World Cup ""play-offs"" are a series of matches to determine which teams qualify for the World Cup in the first place - not part of the actual tournament.The knockout phase in Russia - a series of matches between teams who came first or second in their groups, culminating in the World Cup final in Moscow on 15 July - is never referred to as the ""play-offs"".To be fair to Boles, he said his campaign was about reclaiming the flag and building a modern English identity rather than being about what's happening on on the pitch. Football is not his specialism, as he freely admitted in a 2014 tweet:The Sun's campaign was successful, and departments agreed to fly the St George's flag during matches.The Department for International Trade was so keen to draw attention to this that not only did they tweet about this, but they also emailed journalists to say that they had tweeted about this.The Labour Party also made a subtle linguistic slip-up in the run-up to the Belgium game.Jumping on the World Cup bandwagon to criticise Theresa May and her ministers, Labour tweeted that May's ""squad"" should be ""benched"". That might be something people would say in American sports commentary, but is not a phrase commonly heard in discussions about English football.But even if politicians' 2018 World Cup tweets are sometimes a bit clunky, they don't quite reach the heights of David Cameron's 2015 gaffe.In a speech during the election campaign the former prime minister mistakenly said he was a West Ham fan rather than an Aston Villa fan. He said he had gone ""off script"" with the remark and blamed it on a ""brain fade"", insisting ""I've been an Aston Villa fan all my life""."
2018-06-28,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20180629142844/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44657460,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe future of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland is proving to be a massive challenge in the Brexit negotiations, and talk of ""no deal"" is making a lot of people nervous. But it's not just in the UK that this matters, because the Republic of Ireland depends on trade with the United Kingdom for its economic well-being. There's been a lot of talk about north-south trade across the border with Northern Ireland, and the need to avoid any border checks. But in purely economic terms, east-west trade across the Irish Sea between Ireland and Great Britain is far more important.   The vast majority of freight traffic leaving the Republic of Ireland is exported from Dublin, with the busiest routes to ports such as Liverpool and Holyhead.How much trade are we talking about? One way of measuring it is to look at the data on roll-on roll-off freight containers, many of them carrying food and other retail items that people rely on every day. Roll-on, roll-off (or Ro-Ro) refers to containers transported on lorries or trailers, while lift-on, lift-off (or Lo-Lo) refers to containers that are loaded on to ships by cranes. (And yes, Rolos are still made of chocolate.) Ro-Ro transport is important for produce that needs to get to market quickly, or for just-in-time manufacturing processes that rely on hourly deliveries of components. Ireland's Central Statistics Office released figures on 29 June, which show that in 2017 553,630 loaded Ro-Ro freight containers, on lorries or trailers, were shipped from Ireland to the rest of the world. The vast majority were heading for other ports in the EU. Only a tiny number - 24 - went to ports elsewhere. About 85% of Ireland's total EU freight trade goes via British ports - 475,925 containers last year. We can break that number down a bit further. The Irish Freight Transport Association estimates that the final destination of roughly 60% of the 475,925 freight containers shipped to Britain is Britain itself.That means the other 40% - roughly 190,000 per year - is destined for elsewhere in the EU, transiting across Britain via ports such as Dover or Hull, or via the Channel Tunnel. No-one knows the exact number, although Ireland's Department of Transport has commissioned in-depth research that should be released shortly. But one thing is clear: any kind of breakdown or problem posed by the failure to reach a Brexit agreement could have a huge impact, not just on Ireland's trade with the UK, but also on Ireland's trade with the rest of the EU. Don't forget that in this article we've just looked at Irish exports. Ireland is equally dependent on trade with the UK for its imports.Ireland currently sends lots of its exports to other countries via Britain because it is quicker than doing the whole journey by sea.Could Ireland try to cut out the so-called British land bridge and trade more directly with the rest of the EU? Some steps are already being taken in that direction.  One Luxembourg-based shipping company, CLdN, has just introduced two huge new Ro-Ro freight ferries on the direct sea route from Dublin to the Dutch port of Rotterdam, and to Zeebrugge in Belgium. The new ferries are the largest short-sea Ro-Ro vessels (ones that do not cross oceans) in the world, and can carry 650 cargo units on each voyage.When one of them, the MV Celine, was christened in Dublin in April, the chief executive of Dublin Port Company, Eamonn O'Reilly, said: ""The addition of new ships and sailings shows the shipping sector's resilience and ability to adapt to changing customer needs, particularly in response to Brexit.""""We expect MV Celine will mark the beginning of additional services to continental Europe from Dublin port over the coming years.""  Extra freight capacity is already being phased in on ferry routes between Dublin and Cherbourg, in France, as well as between Cork and Santander, in Spain.  But to give some idea of the extent to which Ireland relies on the British land bridge, statistics from the Port of Dublin show that last year it sent 31,875 loaded Ro-Ro containers to Belgium and Holland, while it sent 188,902 containers to Holyhead alone.So while some contingency plans are already being made, it's not nearly enough to replace the trade that currently goes to or through Britain. And that is a reminder that Ireland needs a good Brexit deal almost as much as the UK does. Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questionsFollow us on Twitter"

""The fragility of the EU is increasing,"" warns EU Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker. ""The cracks are growing in size.""It's been easy to get distracted this last couple of weeks by the new Italian government and its headline-grabbing rejection of NGO migrant rescue boats. But Mr Juncker is right: EU fissures go deeper and are more widespread.Migration pits southern Europe against the north. Italy and Greece smoulder with resentment at having been left alone to deal with migrant arrivals. Meanwhile, northern countries blame the south for not patrolling their Mediterranean borders better and for having, at least in the past, enabled migrants to ""slip away"" northwards towards richer Germany, Austria and Sweden.Read more from Katya: EU's Med migrant crisis: Just a mess or cynical politics?Migration slashes the EU from east to west too.Newer member states from Central and Eastern Europe never signed up to the post World War Two ""all for one and one for all"" vision. When it comes to EU solidarity and burden-sharing, they are fervent non-believers. They determinedly turn their backs when Italy and Germany plead for migrant quotas.The number of migrants arriving illegally in Europe may be down, but so is voter tolerance of the problem.The rise and rise across the EU of tough-on-migration politicians has emboldened hardliners such as Hungary's Victor Orban and Austria's Sebastian Kurz, who takes over the six-month rotating presidency of the EU this Sunday and will push migration as a top priority.""Keep Them Out"" is Austria's main aim and while Europe's (still) most influential leader, Angela Merkel, arrives in Brussels on Thursday pushing - and praying - for compromise on burden-sharing and prevention, the number of EU leaders pushing single-mindedly on the migrant deterrence button is growing.Which brings me to the next layer of European splits provoked by migration: within national governments as well as between countries. Germany is the most dramatic example.Mrs Merkel has clearly been weakened at home by her previous open-door migrant policy. Formerly viewed as politically untouchable, the German chancellor has now been given an ultimatum by her own interior minister.""By the end of this Brussels summit, you need to come home with a workable pan-European solution to stop irregular migrants bleeding into Germany,"" Horst Seehofer has threatened her. ""Or I will unilaterally slam Germany's borders shut.""The Austrian government told me this week it would then immediately follow suit, causing a border-closing domino effect across Europe - with a seismic impact on the EU's prize political and economic project: the open-border Schengen agreement. What a blow for Brussels and nightmare for Europe's export-king Germany that would be. Of course we're not there yet.In true European Union style, once gathered round a table here in Brussels, there will undoubtedly be emphasis on what unites rather than divides member countries.On migration, EU leaders will easily agree to beef up their Frontex border guard. There's also growing convergence around the idea of setting up so-called disembarkation centres outside the EU to identify economic migrants, who in theory could be sent home. Those with a right to asylum or refugee status could then be given safe and legal passage to Europe.And there's much talk of closer co-operation (read: money) with migrant countries of origin and the transit countries (read: Libya and its coastguard) that migrants cross to make their way to people smuggler boats.But these ideas are easier to formulate than to carry out.You would need a lot of EU border guards to truly patrol southern Europe's thousands of miles of open coastline. You would need permission from African countries such as Niger and Chad to set up processing centres, for example. So far that's a distant goal.In the meantime, there is no whiff of EU agreement over what to do with migrants who do reach Europe.Which brings us back to the threat to Schengen.Gloomy German government sources told me they gave the project a three out of 10 chance of survival thanks to the increasingly nationalistic nature of many European governments.""And if Schengen does fail,"" they predict, ""that would be the beginning of the end of the European Union.""It's too early really to herald the demise of the EU or even the end of Mrs Merkel's career in government as a result of this very political migrant crisis in Europe.But, as EU summit host Donald Tusk said to EU leaders on the eve of their arrival: ""The stakes are very high. And time is short."""

Brexit is not the main event. And the prime minister does not have an enormous amount that is new to say until she has cracked her cabinet's heads together next week, after which, Number 10 promises that they'll give out a lot more detail. But it feels like a familiar and frustrating routine on all sides.Eight times Theresa May has arrived at a Brussels summit as prime minister. And it feels like, on each occasion, her counterparts have urged her to provide proper detail of what she wants life outside the EU to be like.It's a broken record and its scratches give everyone earache. But this was the summit by which the deal was more or less meant to be done. The political agreement is scheduled to be done in October, and the UK - by its own admission - is still discussing different options. With only four months left to untangle 40 years of cooperation, the frustration around the continent is more obvious than ever.The Irish leader Leo Varadkar even suggested to the BBC that the UK still refuses to understand the fundamentals - that departure has to mean fewer benefits for Britain.He told me that the UK government still has to grasp the ""basics"" that it would ""not be a relationship of equals"". Theresa May of course acknowledges that the partnership will be different but, politically, she is a million miles away from being able to agree with such a statement, even if she were willing. Instead the UK is eager for the EU to become more flexible. To move away from what the government regards as a rigid approach from the EU Commission.At dinner on Thursday night there's a chance for her to persuade the other leaders to loosen that approach. Only they can tell their negotiators to ease up on their red lines. In return for that request, she'll promise tonight that the UK will be able to agree on its blueprint for the future relationship between the UK and EU, at a meeting of her cabinet next week. With almost daily skirmishes at home - that could prove optimistic. The UK feels lonely and frustrated here today. The migration crisis dominates the agenda, Brexit feels an annoyance, not a priority. But unblocking the process here, means cooling the Tory wars at home.European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker told me that the EU could not go on dealing with a split cabinet. To make progress here, the prime minister needs first to make a deal at home. By anyone's definition, this is not a fun summit for the UK. "
2018-06-28,End of the road,https://web.archive.org//web/20180629142844/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-44628309,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowWe don't know, yet, what happened in the moments before Andrew RT Davies submitted his resignation as Welsh Tory leader in the Senedd.But the road to the end of his leadership was laid in the decision to introduce a Brexiteer former UKIP AM hated by Conservatives to his assembly party group a year ago.Andrew RT Davies - a farmer from the Vale of Glamorgan - became an AM in 2007 and took over the group in 2011 following a contest with Nick Ramsay.The jovial Conservative portrays himself as the ultimate anti-politician politician, frequently telling journalists he does not need the Cardiff Bay establishment.Mr Davies has attempted to forge an independent path for the Tories in Wales - he cannot be accused of always passporting the line down from his colleagues in Westminster.This resulted in the first big row of his leadership, in 2014. When Mr Davies asked his party colleagues to back Wales having more flexibility on income tax than the coalition UK government was offering, some of his AMs rebelled.His pitch for the Senedd election of 2016 included cutting taxes and raising speed limits.But the campaign failed to produce the kind of results that his party had seen the year before in the 2015 general election in Wales, and actually resulted in a loss of seats.In the referendum that came shortly after he decided to back Leave - opposing David Cameron's Remain stance - and ended up being on the winning side.But it was the decision to allow Mark Reckless, the former UKIP AM, to join the party group that sparked rumours of a challenge to Mr Davies that have persisted ever since.Mr Reckless is disliked by many Conservatives for defecting to UKIP before a party conference in 2014 - designed to cause former prime minister David Cameron lasting damage.His inclusion with the Tories in the Senedd caused a storm, spurring internal conflicts both within the group itself and the larger party.MPs queued up to criticise Mr Davies, apparently with the backing of Conservative headquarters.That was followed by anonymous calls from MPs and officials for him to be sacked or removed from office.One source told BBC Wales' Arwyn Jones: ""Water will flow under the bridge before we do anything - but that water will drown Andrew RT Davies.""Obvious threats to his leadership had appeared to ebb away over time, but in reality the animosity that decision generated never went away.Problems between Westminster Tories and Mr Davies also deepened after he fell out with the Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns over who of the two senior Welsh Conservatives should represent their party in 2017 general election debates.As a result of the farce Tory AM Darren Millar ended up taking the helm for the party in the BBC Wales general election debate.The latest big bust-up came just last week, when Mr Davies accused Airbus of making exaggerated threats over the risk of job losses from a no-deal Brexit.Guto Bebb, MP for Aberconwy, said the comments were ""unworthy"" of someone who wanted to be first minister and he said he was not leader of the Welsh Conservatives.His staff have often used the title, citing David Cameron as having bestowed it on him, but it has never been written into the party constitution.Was Mr Bebb's intervention a prelude to moves to push Mr Davies out of the position?"
2018-06-28,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20180629142844/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks  are now focusing on the detail of those issues and on future relations - after agreement was reached on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree within six months on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide, but first let's go back to the basics...It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.1% in the first three months of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.4%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand near a 40-year year low of 4.2%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 4.2% in the year to March 2018, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues. The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May was now put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. It will end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain-supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each playing roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanAn agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pounds buy fewer euros. A slump in the value of the dollar means the exchange rate with the pound is pretty close to where it was before the referendum.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.The UK has proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.A method for calculating the bill has been agreed, but the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more.The question of how and when payments will be made still needs to resolved, but it will be a schedule lasting for many years to come, and it is highly unlikely that anyone will ever be able to give an exact figure for the size of the divorce bill.UK sources say it will be up to £40bn, but some EU sources expect it to be higher than that. No-one can say for sure, and both sides want to keep it that way.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 6.5% in 2016 to 2.7% in 2017, according to the Halifax. It said the slowdown was driven by a squeeze on real wage growth.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-06-28,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180629142844/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to £840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

As I write, Mrs May is holed up with her advisers inside Tory HQ. But a former minister Anna Soubry has called for her to ""consider her position"" - political code for calling for her to resign.

On the two previous occasions in 1970 and February 1974 the PM and the party lost office. While there is no other conceivable administration in the new parliament other than a Conservative-led one, it remains to be seen whether the PM will retain her position. However, so long as the Conservatives can reach an accommodation with the DUP they will have a working majority in the House of Commons.  BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed:When the general election exit poll was revealed at 10pm, the pound immediately dropped by 2% as investors took a position that a hung parliament was a possible outcome of the general election.Why would that cause the currency to decline?

What happens to the Irish border remains a sticking point.The UK says both sides want to see a ""faster pace"" in talks.But Prime Minister Theresa May has been unable to say much new at this summit - the last one before October - because she has yet to get her cabinet to agree on a blueprint for the UK's future relationship with the EU. They are due to meet at Chequers next Friday, in what has been billed as a make-or-break meeting. Mrs May has said the UK will then publish a White Paper setting out ""in more detail what strong partnership the United Kingdom wants to see with the European Union in the future"".Chancellor Angela Merkel said Mrs May would ""come to Germany and we will have a longer debate on this"", once the proposals were published.At the close of the summit, Mr Tusk told reporters there was a ""great deal of work ahead"" on Brexit and the ""most difficult tasks are still unresolved"". ""Quick progress"" was needed if a deal was to be reached at the next summit.""This is the last call to lay the cards on the table,"" he said.He was one of a string of EU chiefs demanding more clarity from the UK prime minister, who left the summit before the 27 other EU leaders discussed Brexit together on Friday.European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said the British had to ""make clear their position"" adding: ""We cannot go on to live with a split cabinet. They have to say what they want and we will respond to that.""EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier warned: ""The time is very short"" and that while progress had been made, ""huge and serious divergence remains, in particular on Ireland and Northern Ireland"".  He also said he hoped to see ""workable and realistic"" proposals from the UK on what the future relationship between the UK and EU should look like.He said he was ""ready to invite the UK delegation to come back to Brussels next Monday"" to continue working on a deal.BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said she understood that UK officials had already informed the EU Commission they would not hold talks on Monday and the ""mini row over diaries"" revealed ""how tetchy things are"".Tensions revealed sometimes by tiny things - I hear Commission asked UK for talks next week, UK said no, so Barnier then invited them again in front of the camerasEnd of Twitter post  by @bbclaurakEuropean leaders at the summit welcomed progress on the legal text of the withdrawal agreement but noted that ""important aspects still need to be agreed"" including the territorial application of the deal ""notably as regards Gibraltar"".  Talks between Spain and the UK over Gibraltar, including access to its airport and the exchange of tax information, continue. They also expressed concern that ""no substantial progress has yet been achieved on agreeing a backstop solution for Ireland/Northern Ireland"", if a deal on customs arrangements is not agreed by December 2020. when the transition period is due to end.And they called on member states and EU institutions ""to step up their work on preparedness at all levels and for all outcomes"" - the European Commission president has said the EU must prepare for the possibility that no Brexit deal will be reached.Mrs May's own cabinet is divided over what the UK's customs arrangements after December 2020 should look like, when the transition period agreed with the EU is due to end. And there are disagreements over the future movement of goods and people across the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.On Thursday, Mrs May said a strong future partnership with the EU was in everyone's interests.""I think both sides are keen to continue that work at a faster pace than we have done up till now and certainly we would welcome that,"" she said.She added that the UK would publish a White Paper setting out ""in more detail [the] strong partnership the United Kingdom wants to see with the European Union in the future"".But she urged fellow EU leaders to tell their negotiators the UK should be allowed to continue to take part in schemes like the Prum mechanism for sharing DNA profiles, the Second Generation Schengen Information System - a database of ""real time"" alerts about certain individuals - and the European Criminal Records Information System.Without UK participation in such schemes, she suggested their collective ability to fight terrorism would be reduced."
2018-06-29,EU leaders plan secure migrant centres,https://web.archive.org//web/20180629142844/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-44652846,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowSecure centres for migrants may be set up in EU states to process asylum claims under a deal reached after marathon talks at a summit in Brussels.The controlled centres would be set up by EU states on a voluntary basis and migrants whose claims were rejected would be ""returned"".Refugees could be resettled in EU states which agreed to take them.The deal follows weeks of diplomatic wrangling over migrant rescue ships, and which country should take them in.Coastguard officials said on Friday that around 100 people were thought to have drowned off the Libyan coast, with 14 rescued.They were found in waters to the east of the capital, Tripoli.There were no details on which countries might set up the secure centres or take in refugees, but French President Emmanuel Macron said they would be in countries where migrants first arrived in the EU. ""We have struck the right balance between responsibility and solidarity,"" he said.Numbers illegally entering the EU have dropped 96% since their 2015 peak, the European Council says. Italy - the entry point for thousands of migrants, mainly from Africa - had threatened to veto the summit's entire agenda if it did not receive help.""After this European summit, Europe is more responsible and offers more solidarity,"" said Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte. ""Today Italy is no longer alone.""Other leaders struck a more cautious note.German Chancellor Angela Merkel said more needed to be done to resolve disagreements.And European Council President Donald Tusk said it was ""too early to talk about a success"".""We have managed to reach an agreement in the European Council. But this is in fact the easiest part of the task, compared to what awaits us on the ground when we start implementing it,"" he told a news conference.By Adam Fleming, BBC News, BrusselsA few things stand out as wins for Italy's new prime minister. The summit's conclusions now include a statement about the need for boats that pick up migrants in the Mediterranean to respect international law. But the big one is approval of the concept of closed, secure processing facilities for migrants arriving in the EU. Some say this will make it easier to send back people whose claims for asylum are rejected. Others are already describing them as prisons. This paragraph is full of caveats, commas and sub-clauses - all the hallmarks of something drafted in the middle of the night. Another striking pledge is for an ambitious partnership with Africa. That's the EU trying to balance its tough internal approach with a friendly external one, and offering incentives to North African countries to host facilities where migrants can be assessed for resettlement in Europe.  The 28 EU leaders also agreed several other measures:Mr Conte had earlier taken the rare step of blocking the conclusions of the joint communiqué until the leaders had settled the migration issue. Both Italy and Greece want other countries to share the burden.However several Central European states have so far rejected an EU scheme to relocate 160,000 refugees from overcrowded camps in Greece and Italy.German Chancellor Angela Merkel had said that the migration issue could be a defining moment for the EU - but she also needed the summit to avert a political crisis at home that could bring down her government. Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, from her Bavarian coalition partner the CSU, had given her a deadline of this weekend. He has threatened to start turning away migrants who have already registered elsewhere from the border in his home state.Without the CSU, Mrs Merkel would lose her parliamentary majority.After the talks, she acknowledged the EU still had ""a lot of work to do to bridge the different views"".About 56,000 migrants have arrived in Europe so far this year, the International Organization for Migration says. More than a million people arrived in 2015.This month's tensions over migrant rescue ships barred from entry to Italian ports - most recently German charity ship Lifeline - have put the issue firmly back in the EU spotlight.The Lifeline was only allowed to dock in Malta after intense diplomacy among several EU states, who each agreed to take some of the migrants on board. Malta said Norway had now also agreed to take a share.Medical charity Medecins Sans Frontières (MSF) branded the new EU deal inhumane. ""The only thing European states appear to have agreed on is to block people at the doorstep of Europe regardless of how vulnerable they are, or what horrors they are escaping - and to demonise non-governmental search and rescue operations,"" MSF's emergencies chief Karline Kleijer said."

The airfields are due to be sold off, mostly for housing, over the next six years as part of MoD cost-cutting.MPs and peers on the all-party general aviation group say they are an important national asset.They say that Defence Minister Tobias Ellwood had agreed to ""look again"" at the aerodrome sell-offs.But all-party group chairman, Conservative MP Grant Shapps, said there were ""significant disparities"" between what Mr Ellwood had said and his subsequent follow-up letter to the group.""Our meeting with the defence minister was very worthwhile and extracted some helpful commitments, including supporting continued aviation use at the 15 military aerodromes being disposed of, where possible,"" said Mr Shapps. He said the group's members were ""very concerned to see no mention of these commitments in the minister's follow-up letter"".""As we celebrate 100 years of the Royal Air Force, which has inspired generations of young people into pursuing high-tech jobs in aviation, we have written back to the minister to ask specifically what the Ministry of Defence is doing to support general aviation. ""We look forward to the minister's reply.""The MPs and peers argue that the 15 airfields should be kept in use for private planes, gliders and flight training - known as general aviation - and to be kept in reserve for military use, in the event of a national emergency. In his written response, Mr Ellwood appeared to rule out the future use of the threatened airfields by other aircraft.He said he ""recognised the strength of feeling"" among the 157 members of the all-party aviation group.But he said private planes could still access 20 other military airfields in the UK and the closure of aerodromes used for pilot training was part of a plan to increase training capacity by concentrating it at fewer sites.He also rejected arguments that closing the airfields posed a security risk. ""I must assure you that the MoD does undertake the necessary investigative work to ensure that the safety and security of service personnel and UK citizens is not compromised,"" said the minister.The MoD said the sites were ""surplus to military requirements"" and as no bids have been received to turn them into civilian airfields they would be used to meet the ""needs of the local community"".A spokesperson said: ""Some of the airfields have not been active for decades, years if not decades, and are not fit for aircraft to land.""All proceeds from the sale of the sites will be reinvested back into defence.""The airfields earmarked for closure are:"

In the report published on Friday, MPs and peers on the Joint Committee on Human Rights said the Home Office demonstrated a ""wholly incorrect approach to case-handling and to depriving people of their liberty"".Individuals were locked up unless they could satisfy officials they should not be detained - an approach with the report described as ""simply unlawful"".""It is for the Home Office to satisfy itself that it has a power to detain an individual - not for an individual to have to satisfy the Home Office that they should not be detained,"" the report said.The report added: ""The Home Office required standards of proof from members of the Windrush generation which went well beyond those required, even by its own guidance; and moreover were impossible for them to meet - and which would have been very difficult for anyone to meet.""This led to officials making perverse decisions about their status. Moreover, it seems that if those standards were not met, Home Office officials then considered that they had grounds to detain.""The committee examined two cases of Windrush migrants - Anthony Bryan, 60, and Paulette Wilson, 62  - who were both detained after being unable to show documents proving their immigration status.Mr Bryan and Ms Wilson both came to Britain from Jamaica as children in the 1960s. Giving evidence to the committee in May, Mr Bryan agreed with a suggestion that a factor in the way he was treated was because he was black.Grandfather Mr Bryan was held in a detention centre twice, for almost three weeks, last year while Ms Wilson was detained for a week.The committee said their experience in detention was ""traumatising and debilitating"".The case files showed that immigration officials dismissed ""ample information and evidence"" for the pair's right to be in the UK, the report said. Some of the evidence discounted by officials included their own accounts of their lives as well as testimonies from family members, people who had known them for decades and lawyers.The report said that detention powers should not be used for people living in the UK and who are unlikely to abscond, the report said.""Detention powers have been used unlawfully and inappropriately by the Home Office without assuring itself that it had a right to deprive individuals of their liberty,"" it said. ""There should be fundamental change in the law, culture and procedures to protect human rights in the work of the Home Office.""Harriet Harman, the committee chairwoman, said what had happened to Mr Bryan and Ms Wilson had been ""a total violation of their human rights by the state's most powerful government department"".She said some members of the Windrush generation had been treated ""shockingly"" and ""shamefully"" and she called for additional safeguards to be put in place.""What you've got to have is a system which allows - when something's going wrong - the individual to check it and there to be proper monitoring,"" she told Radio 4's Today.""There's no independent situation at all. So you've got Home Office officials literally ticking the box for somebody to be detained.""The inquiry rejected the Home Office's claim that the treatment of Mr Bryan and Ms Wilson was due to a ""a series of mistakes"". It said the explanation was not ""credible of sufficient"" and that a ""systemic failure"" is more likely the reason.The scandal led to the resignation of Home Secretary Amber Rudd and the promise from Theresa May of compensation where appropriate.Earlier this month, more than 2,000 people attended a thanksgiving service marking 70 years since the arrival of Caribbean migrants on the Windrush ship.The migrants were among the first to be recruited to rebuild post-war Britain.In 1971, all Commonwealth citizens already living in the UK were given indefinite leave to remain.There are now 500,000 people resident in the UK who were born in a Commonwealth country and arrived before 1971 - including the Windrush arrivals - according to estimates by Oxford University's Migration Observatory.Earlier this month, Home Secretary Sajid Javid pledged a ""fresh look"" at rules and said key parts of the UK's immigration policy will be reviewed."

She said EU leaders should tell their negotiators to allow the UK to continue to take part in schemes like the Prum mechanism for sharing DNA profiles, the Second Generation Schengen Information System - a database of ""real time"" alerts about certain individuals - and the European Criminal Records Information System.She urged them to ""consider what is in the best interests of the safety of your citizens and mine and give your negotiators a mandate that will allow us to achieve this crucial objective.""BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said Mrs May hoped to persuade the 27 other EU leaders to move away from what the UK government regards as a rigid approach from the EU Commission in negotiations and to ease up on their ""red lines"". By the BBC's political editor Laura KuenssbergThe UK is eager for the EU to become more flexible. To move away from what the government regards as a rigid approach from the EU Commission.At dinner on Thursday night there's a chance for her to persuade the other leaders to loosen that approach.Only they can tell their negotiators to ease up on their red lines.In return for that request, she'll promise that the UK will be able to agree on its blueprint for the future relationship between the UK and EU, at a meeting of her cabinet next week.With almost daily skirmishes at home - that could prove optimistic.Read Laura's full blogEarlier this month EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said the UK would be kicked out of the European Arrest Warrant deal after Brexit - which allows EU members to request the arrest and detention of criminals in other countries without extradition talks between them. He argued it could not remain a part of it because the UK wanted to leave the European Court of Justice and free movement rules.The prime minister has been briefing EU leaders at a summit for the last time before October, when both sides hope a deal will be done on the UK's March 2019 departure.But the European Commission president suggested UK cabinet splits were making things more difficult.Arriving at the summit in Brussels, Jean-Claude Juncker said: ""I don't have to lecture Theresa May, but I would like our British friends to make clear their position.""We cannot go on to live with a split cabinet. They have to say what they want and we will respond to that.""The prime minister, who has been under pressure within her own party, has called her cabinet together for a meeting at Chequers on 6 July to agree the UK's blueprint for its future relations with the EU.Arriving in Brussels, Mrs May said she was looking forward to ""securing our strong future partnership"" which she said was in the interests of both the EU and UK .""I think both sides are keen to continue that work at a faster pace than we have done up till now and certainly we would welcome that.""The prime minister has been holding a number of face-to-face meetings with European counterparts on day one of the two-day summit, which is focused on the migration challenges facing Europe and eurozone reform.The remaining 27 EU leaders are due to discuss Brexit on their own on Friday morning, by which point Mrs May is expected to have left Brussels."

Statistics from four health boards showed officers were called 521 times in 2017/18 and 2,719 times since 2013.One nurse said she struggled to pass a street in Newport where she was attacked by a patient's husband on a home visit.She spoke out as a bill to double the sentence for assaults on emergency workers was discussed in Parliament.In total, there were more than 7,900 incidents of physical or verbal assault against Welsh NHS staff in the year to March - suggesting on any given day, 20 workers face abuse.Jane Carroll, a senior Royal College of Nursing (RCN) officer, who was attacked while out on a home visit said calling the police was not taken lightly.""He was circling me and shouting at me and as I opened the door two hands came very hard on my back. I fell over and took the skin off my knees,"" she said. ""I sat in my car and cried for a little while but realised I couldn't stay there because I felt vulnerable.""""When you go into your shift you don't expect to have to deal with the police,"" she added. ""It's not appropriate to have that disruption, but to do what you have to do, sometimes you have to call on them.""On Friday, a private members bill launched by Rhondda Labour MP Chris Bryant was given its second reading in the House of Lords, having passed a major hurdle by getting the backing of the UK government and being passed by the Commons.If approved by the Lords and brought into law later this year, it would see the maximum prison sentence for a common assault double from six months to one year, if the victim is a firefighter, police officer, search and rescue volunteer, or NHS worker.It would will also apply to prison officers, and to anyone who is attacked while assisting an emergency worker.Ms Carroll said she often has to support RCN members who have experienced violence on the job.""I think it's a sad a sign of the times that we need a bill from Chris Bryant to address this behaviour,"" she added. ""We also have to realise the impact this has on the relationship between health workers and the patient. It's not good.""Last week the Welsh Ambulance Service said it was considering giving body cameras to paramedics after a spike in ambulance staff being attacked.And Home Office data indicates police forces in Wales reported 950 assaults on officers in 2016/17, while latest figures from Wales' three fire services indicate firefighters were attacked almost 145 in the last five years."

Prime Minister Theresa May said British personnel worked in ""a new and challenging operating environment"" which some were ""not prepared"" for. She added ""it took too long to recognise that guidance and training for staff was inadequate"", and said British intelligence and the Army were ""much better placed to meet that challenge"".Speaking to the BBC's World at One, committee chairman Dominic Grieve said UK renditions were organised to countries ""with very dubious human rights records, where it would have been very likely that the person would be in fact tortured or ill-treated"".He said British agents working in the US reported concerns about behaviour by their American colleagues, but there ""was no response at the London end"" and ""no questions were asked"" until 2004.The reports come a month after the UK government issued an unprecedented apology to Abdul Hakim Belhaj and his wife, who say they were abducted and taken to Libya after a tip-off from MI6.Mr Belhaj, a Libyan dissident, was tortured and spent six years in prison. Speaking on Thursday, Mr Belhaj's lawyer Sapna Malik said there seemed to be a ""real deference"" to the US.""In a way, this report shows that that [Belhaj case] was not an individual, isolated case, there was a wider pattern of co-operation by the UK,"" she said.The report showed no evidence of direct mistreatment by British intelligence agencies, but there were 13 cases where spies witness first-hand a detainee being mistreated by others, BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera said.Former Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, who was responsible for overseeing GCHQ and MI6 between 2001 and 2006, said he was not aware of the activities or approach of the agencies, adding: ""Many lessons... have since been learnt"".Ken Clarke, who chairs the parliamentary group on extraordinary rendition, renewed calls for an independent inquiry into the UK's role, ""to get to the full truth"".He said the ISC report's findings were ""not small issues which can now be swept under the carpet - and the government must address them urgently"".Speaking to BBC's Newsnight programme, Lord Falconer said: ""We took much too long as a country to work out what our red lines were."" He called for the inquiry into UK complicity in torture overseas to be reopened. Labour's shadow attorney general, Baroness Chakrabarti, and human rights campaign group Reprieve also called for a judge-led inquiry, saying the ISC's report was too limited. Baroness Chakrabarti said in the period after 9/11 the US was ""dabbling in these most horrific practices and - to some extent - the UK government went along for the ride"".The ISC launched its investigation after plans for the independent judge-led Gibson Inquiry collapsed. It studied documents, interviewed former detainees and three ex-officials.But the government denied the committee access to officers who were involved at the time of the UK's involvement in rendition, the report says.By Dominic Casciani, BBC home affairs correspondentToday's ISC reports come six years after a judge-led inquiry was scrapped and court battles failed to get to the bottom of all allegations that the UK got its hands dirty after 9/11. But did the committee get to the whole truth? By its own account, probably not, because it was barred from speaking to some key officers - and it can't entirely establish whether all lessons have been learnt. Today, if a foreign agency is known to be torturing a detainee of interest to the British intelligence agencies, ministers must be informed - that is guidance that has been published.These new rules are being consulted more than 570 times a year - but the ISC doesn't know how many of those cases are being flagged to ministers. Secondly, the ISC was astonished there is still no policy on whether and how UK personnel can be involved in rendition. Ken Clarke was the justice secretary who scrapped the original judge-led inquiry when new allegations of criminality took legal priority. Today he's called for a new inquiry - and other critics have long said that any alternative investigation will never uncover all the wrongdoing.  British citizen Moazzam Begg, previously held in Guantanamo Bay, criticised the inquiry's scope as inadequate, saying ""we still don't know the process of accountability"".Speaking about his own detention, he said British agents ""were there watching as I was hooded, shackled, with a gun to my head"" and claimed they knew he had been led to believe his wife was being tortured.The ISC report said in one case, Ethiopia-born UK resident Binyam Mohamed was held in Pakistan in 2002 - and that MI5 and MI6 were informed by US agents he had been subjected to sleep deprivation. The report said MI5 failed to act on that information before its own officer arrived to interview Mr Mohamed. The US then secretly moved Mr Mohamed to Morocco, where he was tortured. MI5 asked its American allies what was happening to him - but was rebuffed.Despite this, the ISC report says, the agencies gave questions to the US to be put to him. Mr Mohamed was later returned to the UK. Rendering or rendition involves sending a person from one country to another for imprisonment and interrogation, probably by methods such as torture, that would be illegal in the country doing the rendering.US intelligence agencies used the process of ""extraordinary rendition"" to send terror suspects for interrogation by security officials in other countries, where they have no legal protection or rights under American law."
2018-06-29,How do the UK's partners see Brexit and the EU summit?,https://web.archive.org//web/20180629142844/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-44603650,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe EU summit on Thursday and Friday will discuss a number of pressing issues, including migration, economics, security and Brexit. But what do different countries want from the Brussels talks and where does Brexit stand in their priorities?It's tempting to imagine what Angela Merkel and Theresa May might say to one another in a private moment on the margins of the summit. Both leaders, after all, face dissent and open rebellion from within their own ranks. And both are in a bind over borders. But that's exactly why it's unlikely that the German chancellor will pay much attention to Brexit this week. She's far too busy trying to realise her long-promised European migration strategy - and saving her own political skin. Her fragile government hangs precariously in the balance.And it could fall apart if she can't return home with a solution strong enough to see off the rebellion from her interior minister - and coalition partner - who's threatening to unilaterally impose greater migration controls at the German border. In such serious times here, the problem of Brexit seems far a less significant issue to preoccupied lawmakers. But it's not that Germany isn't interested. Industry - in particular the mighty car manufacturing lobby - is beside itself at the thought of a no-deal Brexit. In recent days, Joachim Lang, the director general of the Federation of German Industries, warned that the UK is ""hurtling towards a disorderly Brexit"". He added that only by remaining in the customs union and single market can the Irish border question be answered. Most here want more clarity from Britain about how it perceives its future relationship with the EU, but Mrs May will encounter strong resistance to any proposals that even hint at the reinstatement of a border.  Mrs Merkel, on the other hand, whose experience was shaped by her own early life behind the Iron Curtain in East Germany, now finds herself in an EU openly discussing how and where to strengthen - or even reimpose - Europe's boundaries. France is going into this summit with two concerns uppermost in its mind.  The first is President Macron's beloved long-term project to tie the eurozone economies more closely together. The German chancellor seems to have finally agreed in principle to a watered-down version of his plan, including a common budget for the eurozone and extra measures to help countries facing a recession, though the details are still vague. This summit will be a chance to put their ideas to the other EU countries.The other issue dominating French minds is migration.  President Macron angered Italy earlier this month by saying it was ""irresponsible"" and ""cynical"" to refuse a rescue ship carrying illegal migrants. Italy accused France of hypocrisy, in return.  The issue of how to relieve pressure on the front-line states in Europe's migrant crisis is divisive. In 2015, the former French government promised to take 30,000 refugees from Greece and Italy, but a year later little more than 1,000 had arrived.  And while the French government backs proposals for closed processing centres in front-line states, it does not want to see them on French territory.With all this occupying French minds, there's little room to devote much attention to Brexit.  France has stuck pretty firmly to the EU line of ""no cherry-picking"", saying that freedom of goods, services and people cannot be separated.  But there are those in Paris who believe that appetite is growing to find wiggle room on frictionless goods trading, to protect French exporters to the UK. Though there's little indication that Paris will budge on the issue of a ""passport"" for the City of London and its financial services. Spain's new prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, has made clear he intends to respect commitments his country has made to the EU and the European project in general. But with a range of other issues occupying his agenda - particularly increasing numbers of migrants reaching Spanish shores and tensions in Catalonia - Brexit is not a main priority for the socialist premier. However, he will not be able to ignore the impact the UK's exit could have on Gibraltar, whose British ownership Spain disputes. At the summit, Mr Sánchez is expected to report on the status of recent negotiations between London and Madrid over Gibraltar's future status. Those talks, due to conclude by October, have focused on the possible shared use of the rock's airport and the exchange of tax information on citizens. The EU has agreed that Spain can veto a Brexit accord if it is unhappy with the arrangements for Gibraltar. The summit might offer clues as to whether or not Mr Sánchez intends to continue with the relatively tough line on Gibraltar pursued by the previous Spanish government. Either way, he will want to shore up support from his EU partners on the issue.To Italy's new populist government, Brexit is a rather distracting sideshow. It wants to do business with a post-EU UK and it wants to ensure that the rights of Italian citizens living in the UK are protected. But beyond that, Italy's main preoccupation is migration across the Mediterranean. In this respect, the country has two main objectives: to get EU countries to share the burden of sheltering those who've already reached this continent, and to prevent any more migrants from making the sea journey to Europe.In particular, Italy wants to get rid of the EU's Dublin Regulation, which calls for migrants to be screened in the first place in which they arrive. Italy believes that this places far too much pressure on front-line countries, including Spain and Greece. But Italy may face resistance from fellow populist governments in central and eastern Europe, who do not want to take in any more migrants.Italy's influential Interior Minister, Matteo Salvini, also wants the EU to accept an Italian-Libyan plan announced on 25 June to set up migrant holding centres on Libya's southern borders. In theory, migrants from Africa would be directed to these centres, and prevented from making the journey across the Mediterranean. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban goes into this European summit in confident, but cautious mood. He feels he's winning the argument on migration, but he knows he hasn't won it yet. Brexit, for him, is already yesterday's story. His arch-enemy, Angela Merkel, looks wounded. The new government in Rome shares his anti-immigrant rhetoric, as does the government in Vienna. He can count on Sebastian Kurz, the Austrian Chancellor, to beat the anti-migrant drum for the next six months, as Austria holds the rotating EU presidency. His allies in Bavaria, Horst Seehofer's CSU, are on the warpath. And the other Visegrad countries are right behind him. But Mr Orban is playing for time - he sees his real chance after next year's European parliamentary elections, when he counts on a much bigger role for populist parties like his own, and populist leaders like himself, in the running of the European Union. In the meantime, he still has to face annoying distractions, like criticism in the European Parliament for his crackdown on human rights groups. He'll be hoping the summit is over as quickly as possible, so he can get back to watching the football. He hasn't missed a match yet, he told Hungarian radio. "

At an event in Sarn, near Bridgend, on Friday Mr Irranca-Davies called for the development of ""an integrated Early Childhood Education and Care provision"" which is ""universally available to every child in Wales wherever they may be"".He said the current pilot schemes, offering 30 hours of childcare to children in select parts of Wales, were ""only part of the longer-term vision"".Universal pre-school provision ""helps address the impacts of poverty and narrows the attainment gap when children start school"", he said.Speaking on the Good Morning Wales programme on Friday morning, the former MP said: ""The reason that I'm standing is because people have expressed an interest in nominating me and that's good - I wouldn't be doing it otherwise.""But Mr Irranca-Davies urged fellow Labour assembly members against being too hasty making further nominations.""I do think it's very, very important that if we rush to simply locking down the process before the nominations even open [in September] then we are going to miss a great opportunity here for the Labour Party 20 years on from devolution to actually renew itself, to decide what those ideas and that vision is,"" he said.He summed up his political philosophy as being about ""doing the right thing and being willing to be bold and sometimes, I have to say, to challenge ourselves as well"".While at least four AMs are eyeing up their chances of succeeding Carwyn Jones it's far from certain that everyone who wants to stand will be able to. As things stand, a candidate needs the support of six AMs (including themselves) for their name to appear on the ballot paper. So far, only the Finance Secretary Mark Drakeford has reached that threshold although the Health Secretary Vaughan Gething is only one short. Neither Mr Irranca-Davies nor another announced candidate Eluned Morgan appear close to crossing the line. However, with the party holding a special conference in September to review the rules of the contest, the nominations threshold could well be altered.Mr Irranca-Davies and Ms Morgan appear to believe that if they mount effective campaigns the nominations may take care of themselves. It's a gamble that other Labour AMs are weighing up before deciding whether or not to throw their own hats into the ring."

She will brief EU leaders at a summit for the last time before October, when both sides hope a deal will be done on the UK's March 2019 departure.But the European Commission president suggested UK cabinet splits were making things more difficult.Arriving at the summit in Brussels, Jean-Claude Juncker said: ""I don't have to lecture Theresa May, but I would like our British friends to make clear their position.""We cannot go on to live with a split cabinet. They have to say what they want and we will respond to that.""Asked if talks could end in no deal, Mr Juncker said: ""We are preparing for different scenarios - on the proper withdrawal agreement but, in parallel, we are working on the no deal.""The prime minister, who has been under pressure at home within her own party, has called her cabinet together for what has been billed as a make-or-break meeting at Chequers on 6 July to agree the UK's blueprint for its future relations with the EU. Arriving in Brussels, Mrs May said she was looking forward to ""securing our strong future partnership"" which she said was in the interests of both the EU and UK .""I think both sides are keen to continue that work at a faster pace than we have done up till now and certainly we would welcome that.""She added that the UK would publish a White Paper setting out ""in more detail what strong partnership the United Kingdom wants to see with the European Union in the future"".Mrs May said it was in everyone's interests that a new partnership on economic and security matters be agreed.Cabinet divisions over the UK's customs arrangements after December 2020, when the transition period agreed with the EU is due to end, have yet to be resolved, as have arguments over the future movement of goods and people across the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Mrs May's former top aide, Nick Timothy, has urged her to face down her opponents in the cabinet, telling the Daily Telegraph the ""time for playing nice and being exploited are over"". Please upgrade your browser to view this content.With less than nine months to go before the UK's scheduled exit, businesses have issued warnings about the impact on jobs of leaving the EU without an agreement. The prime minister has been holding a number of face-to-face meetings with European counterparts on day one of the two-day summit, which is focused on the migration challenges facing Europe and eurozone reform.The remaining 27 EU leaders are due to discuss Brexit on their own on Friday morning, by which point Mrs May is expected to have left Brussels. On the eve of the summit, Mr Varadkar said he wanted ""detailed proposals"" from the UK on how it would honour the ""clear commitments"" made in December about the Irish border and citizens' rights.By the BBC's political editor Laura KuenssbergThe UK is eager for the EU to become more flexible. To move away from what the government regards as a rigid approach from the EU Commission.At dinner on Thursday night there's a chance for her to persuade the other leaders to loosen that approach.Only they can tell their negotiators to ease up on their red lines.In return for that request, she'll promise that the UK will be able to agree on its blueprint for the future relationship between the UK and EU, at a meeting of her cabinet next week.With almost daily skirmishes at home - that could prove optimistic.Read Laura's full blog""Time is running out for the withdrawal agreement to be concluded satisfactorily by the October European Council,"" he said. ""I expect EU leaders to send a strong message to the UK that negotiations with the taskforce need to intensify.""The EU's negotiator Michel Barnier has said ""serious divergences"" remain over the question of backstop arrangements for the Irish border if neither of the UK's proposed customs proposals are deemed workable. Elsewhere, Mrs May will seek to show solidarity with the rest of Europe in their efforts to deal with illegal migrant flows across the Mediterranean from Africa and the Middle East.The issue has divided Europe for more than two years but tensions have increased since the election of a populist government in Italy, which has pledged to crack down on unlawful migration, and growing political uncertainty in Germany amid a backlash against Chancellor Angela Merkel's immigration policies.Mrs May is expected to stress the need to tackle the problem of people smuggling at its source, citing the success of a project in Nigeria where once the dangers of crossing the Mediterranean were explained to people, their attitudes to illegal working in the UK changed.On security, the prime minister will call for collective action against misinformation, cyber warfare and money laundering by ""hostile states"" such as Russia. One example of this, she will say, is the UK's sharing of details of Russian intelligence officers expelled after the attacks on Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury with EU allies.The working dinner coincided with England's final World Cup group game against Belgium, whose prime minister Charles Michel was also present. The UK's permanent representative in Brussels couldn't say how much of the match Mrs May, who on Wednesday ordered St George's flags to be flown above No 10 for remaining England games, would see."

Mrs May says she wants a positive trading relationship with the EU after Brexit, and to keep the door open to highly skilled EU migrants. Perhaps that will include Belgian footballers.A few hours later, just as the teams were kicking off, Theresa May gave an England shirt to the Belgian PM.May has never shown much of an interest in football but she certainly knows her cricket, as she showed in an interview with BBC Test Match special last year.There is nothing new about politicians trying to capitalise on sporting success - but Brexit may have given things an extra edge.Irish PM Leo Varadkar, whose country failed to qualify for Russia after losing to Denmark in a play-off, told the BBC he wanted the Red Devils to win, not the Three Lions, on Thursday.Nigel Farage never misses an opportunity to fly the flag, or visit the pub, so it was no surprise to see pictures of him watching the England game at a Brussels bar.But when he draped himself in an England flag, handed to him by a friend, the Beer Factory bar, next door to the European Parliament, erupted in boos, according to The Daily Mirror. and European Parliament staff on a nearby table whipped out an EU flag.Then there is the generic ""come on England"" tweet, which seems straightforward enough, unless individual players are co-opted into the message.The Conservative Party's official Twitter account posted this just before the Belgium game:The two men pictured are Manchester United's Jesse Lingard, who scored against Panama, and Manchester City's Raheem Sterling.Jesse Lingard's political views are unknown. But three years ago, Raheem Sterling recorded a video pledging his support to Labour's Dawn Butler. Butler, a close ally of Jeremy Corbyn, was running to be re-elected as an MP in the part of North West London where Sterling grew up.The Labour leader is a football fan - he even presented EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier with an Arsenal shirt last year.But he was accused of making his own World Cup gaffe, sharing a quote by former Liverpool manager Bill Shankly ahead of England's game against Tunisia. As many on Twitter were quick to point out, Shankly was perhaps not the ideal person to provide pre-match inspiration for the England football team.The Scottish legend once said about playing for his country: ""It's fantastic. You look down at your dark blue shirt, and the wee lion looks up at you and says 'Get out after the English...!'""Some political World Cup slip-ups are a little more subtle. While the basic rules of football are familiar to just about everyone, using the wrong footballing phrase can give the game away.Conservative MP Nick Boles threw his support behind a campaign by the Sun newspaper to fly the St George's flag above government departments during England matches.But as any football fan will know, the World Cup ""play-offs"" are a series of matches to determine which teams qualify for the World Cup in the first place - not part of the actual tournament.The knockout phase in Russia - a series of matches between teams who came first or second in their groups, culminating in the World Cup final in Moscow on 15 July - is never referred to as the ""play-offs"".To be fair to Boles, he said his campaign was about reclaiming the flag and building a modern English identity rather than being about what's happening on on the pitch. Football is not his specialism, as he freely admitted in a 2014 tweet:The Sun's campaign was successful, and departments agreed to fly the St George's flag during matches.The Department for International Trade was so keen to draw attention to this that not only did they tweet about this, but they also emailed journalists to say that they had tweeted about this.The Labour Party also made a subtle linguistic slip-up in the run-up to the Belgium game.Jumping on the World Cup bandwagon to criticise Theresa May and her ministers, Labour tweeted that May's ""squad"" should be ""benched"". That might be something people would say in American sports commentary, but is not a phrase commonly heard in discussions about English football.But even if politicians' 2018 World Cup tweets are sometimes a bit clunky, they don't quite reach the heights of David Cameron's 2015 gaffe.In a speech during the election campaign the former prime minister mistakenly said he was a West Ham fan rather than an Aston Villa fan. He said he had gone ""off script"" with the remark and blamed it on a ""brain fade"", insisting ""I've been an Aston Villa fan all my life""."

But it's not just in the UK that this matters, because the Republic of Ireland depends on trade with the United Kingdom for its economic well-being. There's been a lot of talk about north-south trade across the border with Northern Ireland, and the need to avoid any border checks. But in purely economic terms, east-west trade across the Irish Sea between Ireland and Great Britain is far more important.   The vast majority of freight traffic leaving the Republic of Ireland is exported from Dublin, with the busiest routes to ports such as Liverpool and Holyhead.How much trade are we talking about? One way of measuring it is to look at the data on roll-on roll-off freight containers, many of them carrying food and other retail items that people rely on every day. Roll-on, roll-off (or Ro-Ro) refers to containers transported on lorries or trailers, while lift-on, lift-off (or Lo-Lo) refers to containers that are loaded on to ships by cranes. (And yes, Rolos are still made of chocolate.) Ro-Ro transport is important for produce that needs to get to market quickly, or for just-in-time manufacturing processes that rely on hourly deliveries of components. Ireland's Central Statistics Office released figures on 29 June, which show that in 2017 553,630 loaded Ro-Ro freight containers, on lorries or trailers, were shipped from Ireland to the rest of the world. The vast majority were heading for other ports in the EU. Only a tiny number - 24 - went to ports elsewhere. About 85% of Ireland's total EU freight trade goes via British ports - 475,925 containers last year. We can break that number down a bit further. The Irish Freight Transport Association estimates that the final destination of roughly 60% of the 475,925 freight containers shipped to Britain is Britain itself.That means the other 40% - roughly 190,000 per year - is destined for elsewhere in the EU, transiting across Britain via ports such as Dover or Hull, or via the Channel Tunnel. No-one knows the exact number, although Ireland's Department of Transport has commissioned in-depth research that should be released shortly. But one thing is clear: any kind of breakdown or problem posed by the failure to reach a Brexit agreement could have a huge impact, not just on Ireland's trade with the UK, but also on Ireland's trade with the rest of the EU. Don't forget that in this article we've just looked at Irish exports. Ireland is equally dependent on trade with the UK for its imports.Ireland currently sends lots of its exports to other countries via Britain because it is quicker than doing the whole journey by sea.Could Ireland try to cut out the so-called British land bridge and trade more directly with the rest of the EU? Some steps are already being taken in that direction.  One Luxembourg-based shipping company, CLdN, has just introduced two huge new Ro-Ro freight ferries on the direct sea route from Dublin to the Dutch port of Rotterdam, and to Zeebrugge in Belgium. The new ferries are the largest short-sea Ro-Ro vessels (ones that do not cross oceans) in the world, and can carry 650 cargo units on each voyage.When one of them, the MV Celine, was christened in Dublin in April, the chief executive of Dublin Port Company, Eamonn O'Reilly, said: ""The addition of new ships and sailings shows the shipping sector's resilience and ability to adapt to changing customer needs, particularly in response to Brexit.""""We expect MV Celine will mark the beginning of additional services to continental Europe from Dublin port over the coming years.""  Extra freight capacity is already being phased in on ferry routes between Dublin and Cherbourg, in France, as well as between Cork and Santander, in Spain.  But to give some idea of the extent to which Ireland relies on the British land bridge, statistics from the Port of Dublin show that last year it sent 31,875 loaded Ro-Ro containers to Belgium and Holland, while it sent 188,902 containers to Holyhead alone.So while some contingency plans are already being made, it's not nearly enough to replace the trade that currently goes to or through Britain. And that is a reminder that Ireland needs a good Brexit deal almost as much as the UK does. Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questionsFollow us on Twitter"

""The fragility of the EU is increasing,"" warns EU Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker. ""The cracks are growing in size.""It's been easy to get distracted this last couple of weeks by the new Italian government and its headline-grabbing rejection of NGO migrant rescue boats. But Mr Juncker is right: EU fissures go deeper and are more widespread.Migration pits southern Europe against the north. Italy and Greece smoulder with resentment at having been left alone to deal with migrant arrivals. Meanwhile, northern countries blame the south for not patrolling their Mediterranean borders better and for having, at least in the past, enabled migrants to ""slip away"" northwards towards richer Germany, Austria and Sweden.Read more from Katya: EU's Med migrant crisis: Just a mess or cynical politics?Migration slashes the EU from east to west too.Newer member states from Central and Eastern Europe never signed up to the post World War Two ""all for one and one for all"" vision. When it comes to EU solidarity and burden-sharing, they are fervent non-believers. They determinedly turn their backs when Italy and Germany plead for migrant quotas.The number of migrants arriving illegally in Europe may be down, but so is voter tolerance of the problem.The rise and rise across the EU of tough-on-migration politicians has emboldened hardliners such as Hungary's Victor Orban and Austria's Sebastian Kurz, who takes over the six-month rotating presidency of the EU this Sunday and will push migration as a top priority.""Keep Them Out"" is Austria's main aim and while Europe's (still) most influential leader, Angela Merkel, arrives in Brussels on Thursday pushing - and praying - for compromise on burden-sharing and prevention, the number of EU leaders pushing single-mindedly on the migrant deterrence button is growing.Which brings me to the next layer of European splits provoked by migration: within national governments as well as between countries. Germany is the most dramatic example.Mrs Merkel has clearly been weakened at home by her previous open-door migrant policy. Formerly viewed as politically untouchable, the German chancellor has now been given an ultimatum by her own interior minister.""By the end of this Brussels summit, you need to come home with a workable pan-European solution to stop irregular migrants bleeding into Germany,"" Horst Seehofer has threatened her. ""Or I will unilaterally slam Germany's borders shut.""The Austrian government told me this week it would then immediately follow suit, causing a border-closing domino effect across Europe - with a seismic impact on the EU's prize political and economic project: the open-border Schengen agreement. What a blow for Brussels and nightmare for Europe's export-king Germany that would be. Of course we're not there yet.In true European Union style, once gathered round a table here in Brussels, there will undoubtedly be emphasis on what unites rather than divides member countries.On migration, EU leaders will easily agree to beef up their Frontex border guard. There's also growing convergence around the idea of setting up so-called disembarkation centres outside the EU to identify economic migrants, who in theory could be sent home. Those with a right to asylum or refugee status could then be given safe and legal passage to Europe.And there's much talk of closer co-operation (read: money) with migrant countries of origin and the transit countries (read: Libya and its coastguard) that migrants cross to make their way to people smuggler boats.But these ideas are easier to formulate than to carry out.You would need a lot of EU border guards to truly patrol southern Europe's thousands of miles of open coastline. You would need permission from African countries such as Niger and Chad to set up processing centres, for example. So far that's a distant goal.In the meantime, there is no whiff of EU agreement over what to do with migrants who do reach Europe.Which brings us back to the threat to Schengen.Gloomy German government sources told me they gave the project a three out of 10 chance of survival thanks to the increasingly nationalistic nature of many European governments.""And if Schengen does fail,"" they predict, ""that would be the beginning of the end of the European Union.""It's too early really to herald the demise of the EU or even the end of Mrs Merkel's career in government as a result of this very political migrant crisis in Europe.But, as EU summit host Donald Tusk said to EU leaders on the eve of their arrival: ""The stakes are very high. And time is short."""

Brexit is not the main event. And the prime minister does not have an enormous amount that is new to say until she has cracked her cabinet's heads together next week, after which, Number 10 promises that they'll give out a lot more detail. But it feels like a familiar and frustrating routine on all sides.Eight times Theresa May has arrived at a Brussels summit as prime minister. And it feels like, on each occasion, her counterparts have urged her to provide proper detail of what she wants life outside the EU to be like.It's a broken record and its scratches give everyone earache. But this was the summit by which the deal was more or less meant to be done. The political agreement is scheduled to be done in October, and the UK - by its own admission - is still discussing different options. With only four months left to untangle 40 years of cooperation, the frustration around the continent is more obvious than ever.The Irish leader Leo Varadkar even suggested to the BBC that the UK still refuses to understand the fundamentals - that departure has to mean fewer benefits for Britain.He told me that the UK government still has to grasp the ""basics"" that it would ""not be a relationship of equals"". Theresa May of course acknowledges that the partnership will be different but, politically, she is a million miles away from being able to agree with such a statement, even if she were willing. Instead the UK is eager for the EU to become more flexible. To move away from what the government regards as a rigid approach from the EU Commission.At dinner on Thursday night there's a chance for her to persuade the other leaders to loosen that approach. Only they can tell their negotiators to ease up on their red lines. In return for that request, she'll promise tonight that the UK will be able to agree on its blueprint for the future relationship between the UK and EU, at a meeting of her cabinet next week. With almost daily skirmishes at home - that could prove optimistic. The UK feels lonely and frustrated here today. The migration crisis dominates the agenda, Brexit feels an annoyance, not a priority. But unblocking the process here, means cooling the Tory wars at home.European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker told me that the EU could not go on dealing with a split cabinet. To make progress here, the prime minister needs first to make a deal at home. By anyone's definition, this is not a fun summit for the UK. "
2018-06-29,End of the road,https://web.archive.org//web/20180629142844/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-44628309,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowWe don't know, yet, what happened in the moments before Andrew RT Davies submitted his resignation as Welsh Tory leader in the Senedd.But the road to the end of his leadership was laid in the decision to introduce a Brexiteer former UKIP AM hated by Conservatives to his assembly party group a year ago.Andrew RT Davies - a farmer from the Vale of Glamorgan - became an AM in 2007 and took over the group in 2011 following a contest with Nick Ramsay.The jovial Conservative portrays himself as the ultimate anti-politician politician, frequently telling journalists he does not need the Cardiff Bay establishment.Mr Davies has attempted to forge an independent path for the Tories in Wales - he cannot be accused of always passporting the line down from his colleagues in Westminster.This resulted in the first big row of his leadership, in 2014. When Mr Davies asked his party colleagues to back Wales having more flexibility on income tax than the coalition UK government was offering, some of his AMs rebelled.His pitch for the Senedd election of 2016 included cutting taxes and raising speed limits.But the campaign failed to produce the kind of results that his party had seen the year before in the 2015 general election in Wales, and actually resulted in a loss of seats.In the referendum that came shortly after he decided to back Leave - opposing David Cameron's Remain stance - and ended up being on the winning side.But it was the decision to allow Mark Reckless, the former UKIP AM, to join the party group that sparked rumours of a challenge to Mr Davies that have persisted ever since.Mr Reckless is disliked by many Conservatives for defecting to UKIP before a party conference in 2014 - designed to cause former prime minister David Cameron lasting damage.His inclusion with the Tories in the Senedd caused a storm, spurring internal conflicts both within the group itself and the larger party.MPs queued up to criticise Mr Davies, apparently with the backing of Conservative headquarters.That was followed by anonymous calls from MPs and officials for him to be sacked or removed from office.One source told BBC Wales' Arwyn Jones: ""Water will flow under the bridge before we do anything - but that water will drown Andrew RT Davies.""Obvious threats to his leadership had appeared to ebb away over time, but in reality the animosity that decision generated never went away.Problems between Westminster Tories and Mr Davies also deepened after he fell out with the Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns over who of the two senior Welsh Conservatives should represent their party in 2017 general election debates.As a result of the farce Tory AM Darren Millar ended up taking the helm for the party in the BBC Wales general election debate.The latest big bust-up came just last week, when Mr Davies accused Airbus of making exaggerated threats over the risk of job losses from a no-deal Brexit.Guto Bebb, MP for Aberconwy, said the comments were ""unworthy"" of someone who wanted to be first minister and he said he was not leader of the Welsh Conservatives.His staff have often used the title, citing David Cameron as having bestowed it on him, but it has never been written into the party constitution.Was Mr Bebb's intervention a prelude to moves to push Mr Davies out of the position?"
2018-06-29,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20180629142844/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks  are now focusing on the detail of those issues and on future relations - after agreement was reached on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree within six months on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide, but first let's go back to the basics...It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.1% in the first three months of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.4%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand near a 40-year year low of 4.2%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 4.2% in the year to March 2018, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues. The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May was now put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. It will end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain-supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each playing roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanAn agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pounds buy fewer euros. A slump in the value of the dollar means the exchange rate with the pound is pretty close to where it was before the referendum.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.The UK has proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.A method for calculating the bill has been agreed, but the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more.The question of how and when payments will be made still needs to resolved, but it will be a schedule lasting for many years to come, and it is highly unlikely that anyone will ever be able to give an exact figure for the size of the divorce bill.UK sources say it will be up to £40bn, but some EU sources expect it to be higher than that. No-one can say for sure, and both sides want to keep it that way.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 6.5% in 2016 to 2.7% in 2017, according to the Halifax. It said the slowdown was driven by a squeeze on real wage growth.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-06-29,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180629142844/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to £840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

Read more from LauraJohn Curtice, Professor of Politics at the University of StrathclydeThis is the third post-war snap election called unexpectedly before a party's term of office had come to an end.  On the two previous occasions in 1970 and February 1974 the PM and the party lost office. While there is no other conceivable administration in the new parliament other than a Conservative-led one, it remains to be seen whether the PM will retain her position. However, so long as the Conservatives can reach an accommodation with the DUP they will have a working majority in the House of Commons.  BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed:When the general election exit poll was revealed at 10pm, the pound immediately dropped by 2% as investors took a position that a hung parliament was a possible outcome of the general election.Why would that cause the currency to decline? Because a hung parliament means that the government's direction of travel would be less certain.

2018-06-30,Longer tenancies for renters proposed,https://web.archive.org//web/20180701062522/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-44671094,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowA minimum tenancy term of three years would be introduced under government proposals to give people renting homes in England more security.Figures show 80% of tenants currently have contracts of six or 12 months and ministers say longer agreements would allow them to put down more roots. They add tenants would be able to leave earlier under the plans while landlords would get more financial security.  Labour says the plans do not go far enough and rent rises should be capped. Polly Neate, chief executive of housing charity Shelter, said loss of tenancy was ""the main driver of homelessness"" and called for the government to ""go beyond three years"".A consultation on the minimum tenancy term will run until the end of the August.Exemptions to the rules could apply to some types of tenant - for instance those in student accommodation.Government figures show renters do stay in a property for an average of four years but most have shorter contracts.George Robertson, a landlord from St Albans, is concerned about how the proposals will affect him. ""I am a landlord with one house used as a pension top-up after my wife's state pension age was hiked up at short notice,"" he said.  ""We feel this proposal will force small landlords like us, with just one property, out of the market [and] it will make it so much harder to manage difficulties with problem tenants. ""If this becomes law I will sell my property as we couldn't face the hassle of dealing with possible issues."" Jonathan Pearson, a renter living in London, is worried the proposals will mean less flexibility for tenants.""If in future I say I only plan on renting for less than three years, that would reduce my chances of securing a property,"" said Mr Pearson.He said the real problem was the ""attitude of estate agents"", who treat tenants as a ""commodity"" and ""charge ridiculous tenancy renewal fees after the 12 month period is up"".But Communities Secretary James Brokenshire said it was an important step forward for tenants. He added: ""It is deeply unfair when renters are forced to uproot their lives or find new schools for their children at short notice due to the terms of their rental contract.""Being able to call your rental property your home is vital to putting down roots and building stronger communities.""By BBC business correspondent Joe LynamSomething significant has happened to home ownership in the UK - it's dropped from 72% a decade ago to 63% last year. Much of that is down to affordability - especially in the south east of England, bank reticence to lend and stagnant real wages. That has meant that the number of people who need to rent is rising. The proportion of 35 to 54-year-olds who live as private tenants has nearly doubled in 10 years. Meanwhile, protections afforded to renters have not kept pace. So, any plan to impose minimum terms to rental agreements of three years would benefit millions hoping for some security of tenure. But it may also cause problems. Landlords could have less flexibility in financing of their properties and have to pay higher interest rates to lenders, which could then be passed on to tenants.  Furthermore, tenants may not like being locked into long-term contracts if their own circumstances change and they need to move or even buy a house.Finding a middle ground won't be easy in the consultation.Shadow housing secretary John Healey said: ""Any fresh help for renters is welcome but this latest promise is meaningless if landlords can still force tenants out by hiking up the rent.He said Labour plans included controls on rents, an end to no-fault evictions and protection against substandard properties.Polly Neate, chief executive of charity Shelter, said: ""This is an important step forward. Losing a tenancy is the main driver of homelessness and also causes huge instability for renting families so everyone who rents will be very pleased to see a move towards longer tenancies. ""But if the government really wants to stand up and provide stability for renters, they can and should go beyond three years to provide real protection from eviction, and the huge upheaval of having to move home, jobs and schools.""The government needs to bring forward new legislation quickly - with tens of thousands of families already homeless and many more at risk of the same fate, we simply cannot wait."""
2018-06-30,Govia Thameslink 'could lose franchise',https://web.archive.org//web/20180701062522/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-44671423,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowRail operator Govia Thameslink faces being stripped of its franchises unless performance on its services in the South East of England rapidly improves, the BBC understands.A source said the government could begin the process within weeks. Passengers on its Thameslink and Great Northern trains have endured more than a month of disruption following the introduction of new timetables in May. Meanwhile, the firm said it is working on plans to compensate passengers. ""The industry is working together on this and an announcement will be made in due course,"" said a spokesman for Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR). The BBC understands that commuters are set to receive compensation worth a month's travel. GTR - which also runs Southern and the Gatwick Express services - changed the time of every train on its timetable on 20 May.Passengers were warned of disruption before the changes were brought in, but the implementation of the new timetable saw some services withdrawn and further cancellations without any warning.Since then, GTR chief executive Charles Horton has resigned and Transport Secretary Chris Grayling has faced calls to stand down - as MPs from across all parties voiced their concern at the disruption caused in their constituencies.Passengers have expressed their anger on social media, while last week a memo leaked by the RMT union revealed that extra security staff were at stations to protect staff from ""unhappy customers"".But there is also frustration within government that while Northern, which encountered similar problems in the North of England, has introduced an interim timetable, Govia Thameslink's equivalent is still a fortnight away. ""They are now in the last chance saloon,"" a government source told the BBC.Will Graves, from Arlesey in Bedfordshire, spends around £400 each month commuting to London - but told the BBC the current service is ""the worst I can remember in my 14 years of commuting"".Mr Graves said that trains are regularly cancelled and almost always delayed - often due to no driver being available.""When you do get on a train, you're standing shoulder to shoulder - it's horrendous,"" said Mr Graves. ""I think I've had only one journey that hasn't been delayed in the last month."" Trent Gashi, who commutes from Flitwick, Befordshire, to London, described Govia Thameslink's service as an ""utter farce"" and said ticket price rises in 2018 had ""added insult to injury"". ""Trains are cancelled without notice, people are ferried on and off as if they are livestock,"" said Mr Gashi.""They make so much money out of people like us. It needs to be seriously addressed by the government.""Mick Cash, general secretary of the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers, has called for the UK's privatised rail networks to be brought back into public ownership ""on a permanent basis"".He described the ""last chance saloon"" comment as ""empty rhetoric"" that tells ""these basket-case companies"" that they have been ""let off the hook again while services are reduced to chaos"".He added: ""This is no time for empty threats from unnamed government sources.""Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said that, after ""months of chaos"" for passengers, he was in favour of Govia Thameslink losing its franchise.He tweeted: ""City Hall will push for @TfL to take over more commuter routes so we can provide Londoners with a better service.""A spokesman for Govia Thameslink refused to comment on the reports about the possible loss of the franchises, instead choosing to re-release a statement in which it said it was ""sorry for the disruption"". GTR had added it rescheduled every train in its franchise in an attempt to improve rail efficiency but it was a ""hugely complicated task"" and involved re-training drivers on new routes.Mr Grayling had previously announced there would be compensation for commuters and an inquiry into what went wrong, saying there had been ""major failures"" by the rail industry.A Department for Transport spokesman added: ""GTR passengers are encountering unacceptable service levels and the transport secretary and rail minister have been clear it is their priority that this is put right as soon as possible."""
2018-06-30,Surge in Britons getting EU nationality,https://web.archive.org//web/20180701062522/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44629193,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThere has been a surge in UK citizens acquiring the nationality of another EU country since the Brexit referendum, according to data obtained by the BBC.In 2017 a total of 12,994 UK citizens obtained the nationality of one of the 17 member states from which the BBC has received figures. This compares with 5,025 in 2016 and only 1,800 in 2015.The most frequent new nationality was German, which saw a huge jump from just 594 cases in 2015 up to 7,493 in 2017. One applicant, Paul Petty, from Bath, gained a German passport and is now a dual German/British citizen. ""I feel like Europe is pulling apart a bit at the moment,"" he told the BBC. ""I want to remain part of the EU.""It took three weeks for Mr Petty to receive his new passport. He was eligible because of his mother's status as a Jewish refugee.He described the process as ""really easy"", as he still had his mother's passport.The rise is presumed to be the result of Britons who can meet the criteria seeking to keep their legal rights attached to European Union membership. The 2017 figure is about seven times the 2015 level.The dramatic increase is consistent across many countries.  France was the second most popular nationality, jumping from 320 instances in 2015 to 1,518 last year, and then Belgium, where the increase was from 127 to 1,381.The number for Ireland rose from 54 in 2015 to 529 in 2017. However, this does not include new Irish passport applications from the much larger number of people who already had entitlement to Irish citizenship, due for example to being born in Northern Ireland.Their new nationalities will guarantee the recipients the rights to travel, live and work throughout the EU after Brexit, and they may be able to pass these on to their children.  In most cases those involved have also retained their British citizenship and so have become dual nationals.Lucy Hales has been living in Italy for five years, having previously spent 12 years in Spain, and plans to apply for Italian passports. ""It is likely that we will move to another European country, because of my husband's job, so having Italian citizenship would give us some certainty,"" she said.The BBC has obtained this data for 2017 from 17 of the 27 other EU member states. In the other cases it is not yet ready for publication. These 17 include most of the particularly relevant countries, accounting for over three-quarters of all such new citizenships in 2016. Only a limited proportion of British citizens would qualify for citizenship of another EU state. The bureaucratic process of applying can be slow and laborious.The criteria vary from one country to another and are sometimes complex, usually depending on ancestry and family links or residency. In the case of Germany, there is special provision for people whose German ancestors were victims of Nazi persecution.British citizens who fit a nation's requirements will still be able to apply after Brexit, although for some countries there may be complications. For example, Germany allows dual nationality only with EU states. Unless this changes Britons who become German after Brexit has happened could then find they have to renounce their UK citizenship.

What happens to the Irish border remains a sticking point.The UK says both sides want to see a ""faster pace"" in talks.But Prime Minister Theresa May has been unable to say much new at this summit - the last one before October - because she has yet to get her cabinet to agree on a blueprint for the UK's future relationship with the EU. They are due to meet at Chequers next Friday, in what has been billed as a make-or-break meeting. Mrs May has said the UK will then publish a White Paper setting out ""in more detail what strong partnership the United Kingdom wants to see with the European Union in the future"".Chancellor Angela Merkel said Mrs May would ""come to Germany and we will have a longer debate on this"", once the proposals were published.At the close of the summit, Mr Tusk told reporters there was a ""great deal of work ahead"" on Brexit and the ""most difficult tasks are still unresolved"". ""Quick progress"" was needed if a deal was to be reached at the next summit.""This is the last call to lay the cards on the table,"" he said.By the BBC's political editor Laura KuenssbergEuropean leaders can repeat the same message, louder and louder.But this EU summit's instructions to Theresa May may as well have been shouted into an empty cupboard.Because they know what she knows - that the past 24 hours of Brexit conversations are not nearly as important as the next seven days of discussions at home between Number 10 and the rest of the government.And after more than two years, this time next week ministers should be nearing the conclusion of their country retreat at Chequers.It's there that the prime minister hopes to find resolution in her team on a more detailed offer to the rest of the EU - easing, if not removing, all the contradictions in the Tories' positions.He was one of a string of EU chiefs demanding more clarity from the UK prime minister, who left the summit before the 27 other EU leaders discussed Brexit together on Friday.European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said the British had to ""make clear their position"" adding: ""We cannot go on to live with a split cabinet. They have to say what they want and we will respond to that.""EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier warned: ""The time is very short"" and that while progress had been made, ""huge and serious divergence remains, in particular on Ireland and Northern Ireland"".  He also said he hoped to see ""workable and realistic"" proposals from the UK on what the future relationship between the UK and EU should look like.He said he was ""ready to invite the UK delegation to come back to Brussels next Monday"" to continue working on a deal.BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said she understood that UK officials had already informed the EU Commission they would not hold talks on Monday and the ""mini row over diaries"" revealed ""how tetchy things are"".Tensions revealed sometimes by tiny things - I hear Commission asked UK for talks next week, UK said no, so Barnier then invited them again in front of the camerasEnd of Twitter post  by @bbclaurakEuropean leaders at the summit welcomed progress on the legal text of the withdrawal agreement but noted that ""important aspects still need to be agreed"" including the territorial application of the deal ""notably as regards Gibraltar"".  Talks between Spain and the UK over Gibraltar, including access to its airport and the exchange of tax information, continue. They also expressed concern that ""no substantial progress has yet been achieved on agreeing a backstop solution for Ireland/Northern Ireland"", if a deal on customs arrangements is not agreed by December 2020. when the transition period is due to end.And they called on member states and EU institutions ""to step up their work on preparedness at all levels and for all outcomes"" - the European Commission president has said the EU must prepare for the possibility that no Brexit deal will be reached.Mrs May's own cabinet is divided over what the UK's customs arrangements after December 2020 should look like, when the transition period agreed with the EU is due to end. And there are disagreements over the future movement of goods and people across the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.But asked if he believed Mrs May could resolve the differences, Mr Juncker told the BBC he knew the prime minister and: ""yes ... she will"". Juncker tells us he believes the PM can get the cabinet to agree because ‘I know the British Prime Minister’End of Twitter post 2 by @bbclaurakOn Thursday, Mrs May said a strong future partnership with the EU was in everyone's interests.""I think both sides are keen to continue that work at a faster pace than we have done up till now and certainly we would welcome that,"" she said.She added that the UK would publish a White Paper setting out ""in more detail [the] strong partnership the United Kingdom wants to see with the European Union in the future"".But she urged fellow EU leaders to tell their negotiators the UK should be allowed to continue to take part in schemes like the Prum mechanism for sharing DNA profiles, the Second Generation Schengen Information System - a database of ""real time"" alerts about certain individuals - and the European Criminal Records Information System.Without UK participation in such schemes, she suggested their collective ability to fight terrorism would be reduced.Mrs May's Europe adviser Olly Robbins and Brexit Secretary David Davis were due to appear in front of the UK's Brexit select committee next week but it is understood that the appearance has been delayed until after the publication of the White Paper. Former Brexit minister Lord Bridges, who backed Remain in the EU referendum, told the Evening Standard there was a risk negotiations could become a ""rout"", if the cabinet could not compromise, first with each other, then with Europe.""If nothing changes, there's a danger the UK will have to agree to a withdrawal treaty full of meaningless waffle on our future relationship with the EU,"" warned Lord Bridges.""With so little leverage in the next phase, the negotiations would become a rout. Worse, uncertainty will drag on, damaging our economy."""

The airfields are due to be sold off, mostly for housing, over the next six years as part of MoD cost-cutting.MPs and peers on the all-party general aviation group say they are an important national asset.They say that Defence Minister Tobias Ellwood had agreed to ""look again"" at the aerodrome sell-offs.But all-party group chairman, Conservative MP Grant Shapps, said there were ""significant disparities"" between what Mr Ellwood had said and his subsequent follow-up letter to the group.""Our meeting with the defence minister was very worthwhile and extracted some helpful commitments, including supporting continued aviation use at the 15 military aerodromes being disposed of, where possible,"" said Mr Shapps. He said the group's members were ""very concerned to see no mention of these commitments in the minister's follow-up letter"".""As we celebrate 100 years of the Royal Air Force, which has inspired generations of young people into pursuing high-tech jobs in aviation, we have written back to the minister to ask specifically what the Ministry of Defence is doing to support general aviation. ""We look forward to the minister's reply.""The MPs and peers argue that the 15 airfields should be kept in use for private planes, gliders and flight training - known as general aviation - and to be kept in reserve for military use, in the event of a national emergency. In his written response, Mr Ellwood appeared to rule out the future use of the threatened airfields by other aircraft.He said he ""recognised the strength of feeling"" among the 157 members of the all-party aviation group.But he said private planes could still access 20 other military airfields in the UK and the closure of aerodromes used for pilot training was part of a plan to increase training capacity by concentrating it at fewer sites.He also rejected arguments that closing the airfields posed a security risk. ""I must assure you that the MoD does undertake the necessary investigative work to ensure that the safety and security of service personnel and UK citizens is not compromised,"" said the minister.The MoD said the sites were ""surplus to military requirements"" and as no bids have been received to turn them into civilian airfields they would be used to meet the ""needs of the local community"".A spokesperson said: ""Some of the airfields have not been active for decades, years if not decades, and are not fit for aircraft to land.""All proceeds from the sale of the sites will be reinvested back into defence.""The airfields earmarked for closure are:"

The British airline says it has informed the government of its decision, saying it was ""in the best interest of our customers and people"".It comes amid concern over the removal of Windrush generation migrants and LGBT asylum seekers. Activists are urging other airlines to take similar action.Virgin Atlantic said: ""We've made the decision to end all involuntary deportations on our network, and have already informed the Home Office.""A spokeswoman declined to give details of the number of Virgin Atlantic flights or individuals affected.According to the Guardian, Virgin has provided seats on its commercial flights to detainees and security officers accompanying them for many years. A charity in Jamaica that helps resettle deported people told the paper detainees regularly arrived on Virgin flights.Immigration Minister Caroline Nokes told Parliament last month the majority of enforced deportations used scheduled flights, where people sit alongside paying passengers.  She also revealed the government spent £17m on such flights between 2016 and 2017 and £17.3m between 2015 and 2016.  Activist group Lesbians and Gays Support the Migrants said Virgin told it of the move in response to a yet-to-be published open letter it has written highlighting the deportations of people to countries where they risked persecution.Sam Bjorn from the group added: ""The fact that the company has finally opted to break with this controversial practice testifies to a profound shift in public opinion on deportation since the emergence of the Windrush scandal.""The Windrush scandal hit headlines in April after it emerged that some migrants from Commonwealth countries, who were encouraged to settle in the UK from the late 1940s to 1973, were being wrongly categorised as illegal immigrants.They were part of what is known as the Windrush generation - a reference to the Empire Windrush - the ship that brought workers from the West Indies to Britain in 1948.Their treatment coincided with the Home Office's adoption of a ""hostile environment"" approach, designed to tackle the issue of illegal immigration, and so far, the department has identified 63 people as having been possibly wrongly deported.Lesbians and Gays Support the Migrants wants British Airways and Qatar Airways - who also work on enforced deportations with the government - to end their involvement.Labour MP Stephen Doughty, who is on the Home Affairs Select Committee, has been questioning the government over its deportation policies and welcomed the move from Virgin Atlantic. He told the BBC: ""The whole system of detention and deportation appears to have serious flaws, not just for the Windrush generation, but other individuals who have been subject to wrongful detention - including one of my constituents.""So it is a business decision for airlines, around their culture and ethics.""Asked if other airlines should follow suit, Mr Doughty added: ""If they want to facilitate this system that has a series of questions around its checks and balances... well, they may want to think about it again.""  The airlines did not immediately respond to requests for comment.A Home Office spokesman said: ""We do not comment on operational matters."""
2018-06-30,EU leaders plan secure migrant centres,https://web.archive.org//web/20180701062522/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-44652846,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowSecure centres for migrants may be set up in EU states to process asylum claims under a deal reached after marathon talks at a summit in Brussels.The controlled centres would be set up by EU states on a voluntary basis and migrants whose claims were rejected would be ""returned"".Refugees could be resettled in EU states which agreed to take them.The deal follows weeks of diplomatic wrangling over migrant rescue ships, and which country should take them in.Coastguard officials said on Friday that around 100 people were thought to have drowned off the Libyan coast, with 14 rescued.They were found in waters to the east of the capital, Tripoli.There were no details on which countries might set up the secure centres or take in refugees, but French President Emmanuel Macron said they would be in countries where migrants first arrived in the EU. ""We have struck the right balance between responsibility and solidarity,"" he said.Numbers illegally entering the EU have dropped 96% since their 2015 peak, the European Council says. Italy - the entry point for thousands of migrants, mainly from Africa - had threatened to veto the summit's entire agenda if it did not receive help.""After this European summit, Europe is more responsible and offers more solidarity,"" said Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte. ""Today Italy is no longer alone.""Other leaders struck a more cautious note.German Chancellor Angela Merkel said more needed to be done to resolve disagreements.And European Council President Donald Tusk said it was ""too early to talk about a success"".""We have managed to reach an agreement in the European Council. But this is in fact the easiest part of the task, compared to what awaits us on the ground when we start implementing it,"" he told a news conference.By Adam Fleming, BBC News, BrusselsA few things stand out as wins for Italy's new prime minister. The summit's conclusions now include a statement about the need for boats that pick up migrants in the Mediterranean to respect international law. But the big one is approval of the concept of closed, secure processing facilities for migrants arriving in the EU. Some say this will make it easier to send back people whose claims for asylum are rejected. Others are already describing them as prisons. This paragraph is full of caveats, commas and sub-clauses - all the hallmarks of something drafted in the middle of the night. Another striking pledge is for an ambitious partnership with Africa. That's the EU trying to balance its tough internal approach with a friendly external one, and offering incentives to North African countries to host facilities where migrants can be assessed for resettlement in Europe.  The 28 EU leaders also agreed several other measures:Mr Conte had earlier taken the rare step of blocking the conclusions of the joint communiqué until the leaders had settled the migration issue. Both Italy and Greece want other countries to share the burden.However several Central European states have so far rejected an EU scheme to relocate 160,000 refugees from overcrowded camps in Greece and Italy.German Chancellor Angela Merkel had said that the migration issue could be a defining moment for the EU - but she also needed the summit to avert a political crisis at home that could bring down her government. Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, from her Bavarian coalition partner the CSU, had given her a deadline of this weekend. He has threatened to start turning away migrants who have already registered elsewhere from the border in his home state.Without the CSU, Mrs Merkel would lose her parliamentary majority.After the talks, she acknowledged the EU still had ""a lot of work to do to bridge the different views"".About 56,000 migrants have arrived in Europe so far this year, the International Organization for Migration says. More than a million people arrived in 2015.This month's tensions over migrant rescue ships barred from entry to Italian ports - most recently German charity ship Lifeline - have put the issue firmly back in the EU spotlight.The Lifeline was only allowed to dock in Malta after intense diplomacy among several EU states, who each agreed to take some of the migrants on board. Malta said Norway had now also agreed to take a share.Medical charity Medecins Sans Frontières (MSF) branded the new EU deal inhumane. ""The only thing European states appear to have agreed on is to block people at the doorstep of Europe regardless of how vulnerable they are, or what horrors they are escaping - and to demonise non-governmental search and rescue operations,"" MSF's emergencies chief Karline Kleijer said."

Macmillan Cancer Support, the Royal British Legion, the Royal National Lifeboat Institution and Air Ambulances all run their own draws while the two largest operators - the People's Postcode Lottery and The Health Lottery - have raised £310m and £58m respectively since they were established in 2005 and 2011.Their beneficiaries have included Carers Trust, Dementia UK, Mencap, Dogs Trust, Maggies and the PDSA veterinary charity. The sector has been lobbying the government to relax the £10m limit on sales per lottery every year and the £4m limit per draw.They claim existing limits stifle growth, cause unnecessary bureaucracy and push up costs - reducing support for good causes.The culture department is now proposing amending the Gambling Act to raise the limits to £100m and £5m respectively while also lifting the maximum prize in each draw from £400,000 to £500,000.Culture Secretary Matthew Hancock told the BBC he wanted to do more for society lotteries, which have to give a minimum of 20% of the proceeds of ticket sales to good causes but are not barred from making profit. ""We strongly believe in the power of civil society, of people to improve the area they live in through get-up-and-go,"" he told Radio 4's Today. ""Lotteries can be a part of that.""But he said he was also mindful of any impact on the National Lottery - which has seen a sharp fall in its returns to good causes in the past 18 months.""The National Lottery obviously has a massively positive impact on the country in terms of how we support our sports stars and how much heritage has been saved for the nation,"" he said. ""We need to make sure we support society lotteries but not at the detriment of the National Lottery. ""What we are trying to do is open a debate on how best we do that but we want to see more going to good causes.""Some society lotteries have been criticised for the amount they give to good causes but they argue they complement, rather than eat into, the National Lottery's sales. The People's Postcode Lottery, whose 38 society lotteries raised £93m on behalf of good causes last year, welcomed the government's proposed changes but urged ministers to be more ""ambitious"" and recognise the success of the sector.The company said it was ""odd"" the limit on how much could be raised per draw had doubled between 2005 and 2009 but was now only set to rise by £1m despite the growth in the number of people taking part and proceeds raised. ""Unless the draw limit is future-proofed by being raised further than ministers propose, People's Postcode Lottery expect that additional administration costs will occur over the coming years - stopping charities getting vital funding,"" said its managing director Clara Govier.

In the report published on Friday, MPs and peers on the Joint Committee on Human Rights said the Home Office demonstrated a ""wholly incorrect approach to case-handling and to depriving people of their liberty"".Individuals were locked up unless they could satisfy officials they should not be detained - an approach with the report described as ""simply unlawful"".""It is for the Home Office to satisfy itself that it has a power to detain an individual - not for an individual to have to satisfy the Home Office that they should not be detained,"" the report said.The report added: ""The Home Office required standards of proof from members of the Windrush generation which went well beyond those required, even by its own guidance; and moreover were impossible for them to meet - and which would have been very difficult for anyone to meet.""This led to officials making perverse decisions about their status. Moreover, it seems that if those standards were not met, Home Office officials then considered that they had grounds to detain.""The committee examined two cases of Windrush migrants - Anthony Bryan, 60, and Paulette Wilson, 62  - who were both detained after being unable to show documents proving their immigration status.Mr Bryan and Ms Wilson both came to Britain from Jamaica as children in the 1960s. Giving evidence to the committee in May, Mr Bryan agreed with a suggestion that a factor in the way he was treated was because he was black.Grandfather Mr Bryan was held in a detention centre twice, for almost three weeks, last year while Ms Wilson was detained for a week.The committee said their experience in detention was ""traumatising and debilitating"".The case files showed that immigration officials dismissed ""ample information and evidence"" for the pair's right to be in the UK, the report said. Some of the evidence discounted by officials included their own accounts of their lives as well as testimonies from family members, people who had known them for decades and lawyers.The report said that detention powers should not be used for people living in the UK and who are unlikely to abscond, the report said.""Detention powers have been used unlawfully and inappropriately by the Home Office without assuring itself that it had a right to deprive individuals of their liberty,"" it said. ""There should be fundamental change in the law, culture and procedures to protect human rights in the work of the Home Office.""Harriet Harman, the committee chairwoman, said what had happened to Mr Bryan and Ms Wilson had been ""a total violation of their human rights by the state's most powerful government department"".She said some members of the Windrush generation had been treated ""shockingly"" and ""shamefully"" and she called for additional safeguards to be put in place.""What you've got to have is a system which allows - when something's going wrong - the individual to check it and there to be proper monitoring,"" she told Radio 4's Today.""There's no independent situation at all. So you've got Home Office officials literally ticking the box for somebody to be detained.""The inquiry rejected the Home Office's claim that the treatment of Mr Bryan and Ms Wilson was due to a ""a series of mistakes"". It said the explanation was not ""credible of sufficient"" and that a ""systemic failure"" is more likely the reason.The scandal led to the resignation of Home Secretary Amber Rudd and the promise from Theresa May of compensation where appropriate.Earlier this month, more than 2,000 people attended a thanksgiving service marking 70 years since the arrival of Caribbean migrants on the Windrush ship.The migrants were among the first to be recruited to rebuild post-war Britain.In 1971, all Commonwealth citizens already living in the UK were given indefinite leave to remain.There are now 500,000 people resident in the UK who were born in a Commonwealth country and arrived before 1971 - including the Windrush arrivals - according to estimates by Oxford University's Migration Observatory.Earlier this month, Home Secretary Sajid Javid pledged a ""fresh look"" at rules and said key parts of the UK's immigration policy will be reviewed."

2018-06-30,Political football,https://web.archive.org//web/20180701062522/https://www.bbc.com/news/44656429,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowEngland are through to the knock-out stages of the World Cup despite losing 1-0 to Belgium, and politicians are keen to get in on the action, with variable results.Ahead of Thursday's clash between England and Belgium in Kaliningrad, Prime Minister Theresa May was ambushed by Belgian PM Charles Michel who handed her a red Belgium football shirt which ominously had the word ""Hazard"" written on it.Chelsea's Eden Hazard is one of 12 players in the Belgian squad to ply their trade in the Premier League, alongside Manchester City's Vincent Kompany, and Manchester United's Romelu Lukaku. Mrs May says she wants a positive trading relationship with the EU after Brexit, and to keep the door open to highly skilled EU migrants. Perhaps that will include Belgian footballers.A few hours later, just as the teams were kicking off, Theresa May gave an England shirt to the Belgian PM.May has never shown much of an interest in football but she certainly knows her cricket, as she showed in an interview with BBC Test Match special last year.There is nothing new about politicians trying to capitalise on sporting success - but Brexit may have given things an extra edge.Irish PM Leo Varadkar, whose country failed to qualify for Russia after losing to Denmark in a play-off, told the BBC he wanted the Red Devils to win, not the Three Lions, on Thursday.Nigel Farage never misses an opportunity to fly the flag, or visit the pub, so it was no surprise to see pictures of him watching the England game at a Brussels bar.But when he draped himself in an England flag, handed to him by a friend, the Beer Factory bar, next door to the European Parliament, erupted in boos, according to The Daily Mirror. and European Parliament staff on a nearby table whipped out an EU flag.Then there is the generic ""come on England"" tweet, which seems straightforward enough, unless individual players are co-opted into the message.The Conservative Party's official Twitter account posted this just before the Belgium game:The two men pictured are Manchester United's Jesse Lingard, who scored against Panama, and Manchester City's Raheem Sterling.Jesse Lingard's political views are unknown. But three years ago, Raheem Sterling recorded a video pledging his support to Labour's Dawn Butler. Butler, a close ally of Jeremy Corbyn, was running to be re-elected as an MP in the part of North West London where Sterling grew up.The Labour leader is a football fan - he even presented EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier with an Arsenal shirt last year.But he was accused of making his own World Cup gaffe, sharing a quote by former Liverpool manager Bill Shankly ahead of England's game against Tunisia. As many on Twitter were quick to point out, Shankly was perhaps not the ideal person to provide pre-match inspiration for the England football team.The Scottish legend once said about playing for his country: ""It's fantastic. You look down at your dark blue shirt, and the wee lion looks up at you and says 'Get out after the English...!'""Some political World Cup slip-ups are a little more subtle. While the basic rules of football are familiar to just about everyone, using the wrong footballing phrase can give the game away.Conservative MP Nick Boles threw his support behind a campaign by the Sun newspaper to fly the St George's flag above government departments during England matches.But as any football fan will know, the World Cup ""play-offs"" are a series of matches to determine which teams qualify for the World Cup in the first place - not part of the actual tournament.The knockout phase in Russia - a series of matches between teams who came first or second in their groups, culminating in the World Cup final in Moscow on 15 July - is never referred to as the ""play-offs"".To be fair to Boles, he said his campaign was about reclaiming the flag and building a modern English identity rather than being about what's happening on on the pitch. Football is not his specialism, as he freely admitted in a 2014 tweet:The Sun's campaign was successful, and departments agreed to fly the St George's flag during matches.The Department for International Trade was so keen to draw attention to this that not only did they tweet about this, but they also emailed journalists to say that they had tweeted about this.The Labour Party also made a subtle linguistic slip-up in the run-up to the Belgium game.Jumping on the World Cup bandwagon to criticise Theresa May and her ministers, Labour tweeted that May's ""squad"" should be ""benched"". That might be something people would say in American sports commentary, but is not a phrase commonly heard in discussions about English football.But even if politicians' 2018 World Cup tweets are sometimes a bit clunky, they don't quite reach the heights of David Cameron's 2015 gaffe.In a speech during the election campaign the former prime minister mistakenly said he was a West Ham fan rather than an Aston Villa fan. He said he had gone ""off script"" with the remark and blamed it on a ""brain fade"", insisting ""I've been an Aston Villa fan all my life""."
2018-06-30,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20180701062522/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44657460,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe future of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland is proving to be a massive challenge in the Brexit negotiations, and talk of ""no deal"" is making a lot of people nervous. But it's not just in the UK that this matters, because the Republic of Ireland depends on trade with the United Kingdom for its economic well-being. There's been a lot of talk about north-south trade across the border with Northern Ireland, and the need to avoid any border checks. But in purely economic terms, east-west trade across the Irish Sea between Ireland and Great Britain is far more important.   The vast majority of freight traffic leaving the Republic of Ireland is exported from Dublin, with the busiest routes to ports such as Liverpool and Holyhead.How much trade are we talking about? One way of measuring it is to look at the data on roll-on roll-off freight containers, many of them carrying food and other retail items that people rely on every day. Roll-on, roll-off (or Ro-Ro) refers to containers transported on lorries or trailers, while lift-on, lift-off (or Lo-Lo) refers to containers that are loaded on to ships by cranes. (And yes, Rolos are still made of chocolate.) Ro-Ro transport is important for produce that needs to get to market quickly, or for just-in-time manufacturing processes that rely on hourly deliveries of components. Ireland's Central Statistics Office released figures on 29 June, which show that in 2017 553,630 loaded Ro-Ro freight containers, on lorries or trailers, were shipped from Ireland to the rest of the world. The vast majority were heading for other ports in the EU. Only a tiny number - 24 - went to ports elsewhere. About 85% of Ireland's total EU freight trade goes via British ports - 475,925 containers last year. We can break that number down a bit further. The Irish Freight Transport Association estimates that the final destination of roughly 60% of the 475,925 freight containers shipped to Britain is Britain itself.That means the other 40% - roughly 190,000 per year - is destined for elsewhere in the EU, transiting across Britain via ports such as Dover or Hull, or via the Channel Tunnel. No-one knows the exact number, although Ireland's Department of Transport has commissioned in-depth research that should be released shortly. But one thing is clear: any kind of breakdown or problem posed by the failure to reach a Brexit agreement could have a huge impact, not just on Ireland's trade with the UK, but also on Ireland's trade with the rest of the EU. Don't forget that in this article we've just looked at Irish exports. Ireland is equally dependent on trade with the UK for its imports.Ireland currently sends lots of its exports to other countries via Britain because it is quicker than doing the whole journey by sea.Could Ireland try to cut out the so-called British land bridge and trade more directly with the rest of the EU? Some steps are already being taken in that direction.  One Luxembourg-based shipping company, CLdN, has just introduced two huge new Ro-Ro freight ferries on the direct sea route from Dublin to the Dutch port of Rotterdam, and to Zeebrugge in Belgium. The new ferries are the largest short-sea Ro-Ro vessels (ones that do not cross oceans) in the world, and can carry 650 cargo units on each voyage.When one of them, the MV Celine, was christened in Dublin in April, the chief executive of Dublin Port Company, Eamonn O'Reilly, said: ""The addition of new ships and sailings shows the shipping sector's resilience and ability to adapt to changing customer needs, particularly in response to Brexit.""""We expect MV Celine will mark the beginning of additional services to continental Europe from Dublin port over the coming years.""  Extra freight capacity is already being phased in on ferry routes between Dublin and Cherbourg, in France, as well as between Cork and Santander, in Spain.  But to give some idea of the extent to which Ireland relies on the British land bridge, statistics from the Port of Dublin show that last year it sent 31,875 loaded Ro-Ro containers to Belgium and Holland, while it sent 188,902 containers to Holyhead alone.So while some contingency plans are already being made, it's not nearly enough to replace the trade that currently goes to or through Britain. And that is a reminder that Ireland needs a good Brexit deal almost as much as the UK does. Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questionsFollow us on Twitter"

""The fragility of the EU is increasing,"" warns EU Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker. ""The cracks are growing in size.""It's been easy to get distracted this last couple of weeks by the new Italian government and its headline-grabbing rejection of NGO migrant rescue boats. But Mr Juncker is right: EU fissures go deeper and are more widespread.Migration pits southern Europe against the north. Italy and Greece smoulder with resentment at having been left alone to deal with migrant arrivals. Meanwhile, northern countries blame the south for not patrolling their Mediterranean borders better and for having, at least in the past, enabled migrants to ""slip away"" northwards towards richer Germany, Austria and Sweden.Read more from Katya: EU's Med migrant crisis: Just a mess or cynical politics?Migration slashes the EU from east to west too.Newer member states from Central and Eastern Europe never signed up to the post World War Two ""all for one and one for all"" vision. When it comes to EU solidarity and burden-sharing, they are fervent non-believers. They determinedly turn their backs when Italy and Germany plead for migrant quotas.The number of migrants arriving illegally in Europe may be down, but so is voter tolerance of the problem.The rise and rise across the EU of tough-on-migration politicians has emboldened hardliners such as Hungary's Victor Orban and Austria's Sebastian Kurz, who takes over the six-month rotating presidency of the EU this Sunday and will push migration as a top priority.""Keep Them Out"" is Austria's main aim and while Europe's (still) most influential leader, Angela Merkel, arrives in Brussels on Thursday pushing - and praying - for compromise on burden-sharing and prevention, the number of EU leaders pushing single-mindedly on the migrant deterrence button is growing.Which brings me to the next layer of European splits provoked by migration: within national governments as well as between countries. Germany is the most dramatic example.Mrs Merkel has clearly been weakened at home by her previous open-door migrant policy. Formerly viewed as politically untouchable, the German chancellor has now been given an ultimatum by her own interior minister.""By the end of this Brussels summit, you need to come home with a workable pan-European solution to stop irregular migrants bleeding into Germany,"" Horst Seehofer has threatened her. ""Or I will unilaterally slam Germany's borders shut.""The Austrian government told me this week it would then immediately follow suit, causing a border-closing domino effect across Europe - with a seismic impact on the EU's prize political and economic project: the open-border Schengen agreement. What a blow for Brussels and nightmare for Europe's export-king Germany that would be. Of course we're not there yet.In true European Union style, once gathered round a table here in Brussels, there will undoubtedly be emphasis on what unites rather than divides member countries.On migration, EU leaders will easily agree to beef up their Frontex border guard. There's also growing convergence around the idea of setting up so-called disembarkation centres outside the EU to identify economic migrants, who in theory could be sent home. Those with a right to asylum or refugee status could then be given safe and legal passage to Europe.And there's much talk of closer co-operation (read: money) with migrant countries of origin and the transit countries (read: Libya and its coastguard) that migrants cross to make their way to people smuggler boats.But these ideas are easier to formulate than to carry out.You would need a lot of EU border guards to truly patrol southern Europe's thousands of miles of open coastline. You would need permission from African countries such as Niger and Chad to set up processing centres, for example. So far that's a distant goal.In the meantime, there is no whiff of EU agreement over what to do with migrants who do reach Europe.Which brings us back to the threat to Schengen.Gloomy German government sources told me they gave the project a three out of 10 chance of survival thanks to the increasingly nationalistic nature of many European governments.""And if Schengen does fail,"" they predict, ""that would be the beginning of the end of the European Union.""It's too early really to herald the demise of the EU or even the end of Mrs Merkel's career in government as a result of this very political migrant crisis in Europe.But, as EU summit host Donald Tusk said to EU leaders on the eve of their arrival: ""The stakes are very high. And time is short."""

The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks  are now focusing on the detail of those issues and on future relations - after agreement was reached on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree within six months on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide, but first let's go back to the basics...It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.1% in the first three months of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.4%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand near a 40-year year low of 4.2%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 4.2% in the year to March 2018, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues. The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May was now put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. It will end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain-supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each playing roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanAn agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pounds buy fewer euros. A slump in the value of the dollar means the exchange rate with the pound is pretty close to where it was before the referendum.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.The UK has proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.A method for calculating the bill has been agreed, but the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more.The question of how and when payments will be made still needs to resolved, but it will be a schedule lasting for many years to come, and it is highly unlikely that anyone will ever be able to give an exact figure for the size of the divorce bill.UK sources say it will be up to £40bn, but some EU sources expect it to be higher than that. No-one can say for sure, and both sides want to keep it that way.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 6.5% in 2016 to 2.7% in 2017, according to the Halifax. It said the slowdown was driven by a squeeze on real wage growth.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-06-30,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180701062522/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to £840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

As I write, Mrs May is holed up with her advisers inside Tory HQ. But a former minister Anna Soubry has called for her to ""consider her position"" - political code for calling for her to resign. Read more from LauraJohn Curtice, Professor of Politics at the University of StrathclydeThis is the third post-war snap election called unexpectedly before a party's term of office had come to an end.  On the two previous occasions in 1970 and February 1974 the PM and the party lost office. While there is no other conceivable administration in the new parliament other than a Conservative-led one, it remains to be seen whether the PM will retain her position. However, so long as the Conservatives can reach an accommodation with the DUP they will have a working majority in the House of Commons.  BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed:When the general election exit poll was revealed at 10pm, the pound immediately dropped by 2% as investors took a position that a hung parliament was a possible outcome of the general election.Why would that cause the currency to decline? Because a hung parliament means that the government's direction of travel would be less certain.

The Scottish Tories have more than doubled their returns in some places where the party was previously unelectable. Read more from PhilipSee more images from the night here"
