2015-04-01,Bid to change Speaker election rules,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32061097,"A last-minute bid to change the way the Speaker of the House of Commons is elected is to be debated by MPs.Labour criticised the government motion, to be debated on the final day before the dissolution of Parliament, saying the Conservatives were ""trying to play politics with the speakership"".Under the proposals, a secret ballot would decide whether there should be a contested election for the post.MPs currently have to file through the division lobbies to cast their vote.This means it is clear who does or does not back the incumbent as Speaker.Labour's shadow leader of the Commons Angela Eagle raised the party's concerns in the House on Wednesday evening, questioning whether the motion was within parliamentary rules.Current Speaker John Bercow is - technically - one of them, but many Tory MPs have never liked him.They resent his personal style and some believe he is far from impartial in the way he conducts business in the Commons.Attempts by some to force a vote on his resumption as Speaker in 2010 came to nothing. There have been the occasional measured jibes at him from the prime minister. Other Tories reportedly went much further and formed a group whose members had all been reprimanded by him. But the Speaker is a reformer who believes passionately that the people who elect the members, and pay the bills, should come first.The last act of the coalition looks like being an attempt to unseat him. And they are very serious about it.One Tory MP fighting an important marginal seat had been cleared by his party to be away from Parliament but he is now staying for the vote, such is the importance of it.She told Deputy Speaker Lindsay Hoyle: ""It's just come to my attention that the government has tabled a motion for debate on the final day of this Parliament, with no notice whatsoever to myself as shadow leader of the House, proposing changes to the way in which the Speaker of this House is elected.""Procedural matters in this House, with no consultation with the opposition, no consultation with the chair of the committee itself, for debate in only one hour tomorrow.""Mr Hoyle said the motion had been ""rightly or wrongly"" agreed to on Tuesday, saying that ""business of the House is decided by the government, not by the chair.""A spokesman for Commons Leader William Hague said the motion had been tabled as a free hour had opened up in Thursday's business after the House of Lords approved the Modern Slavery Bill.The proposed change would apply when a Speaker wishes to continue in the post after a general election.Under the current rules, if the Speaker's re-appointment is objected to, a division is held, with MPs choosing to back or oppose the Speaker in the division lobbies.The replacement of this method with a secret ballot was suggested in 2010 by a committee of MPs, which said the public method ""can be seen as a deterrent to the House expressing its views honestly"".MPs will now debate whether this change should be made."

2015-04-01,Public 'don't want more coalitions',https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32055110,"Public enthusiasm for government by coalition is at its lowest in 30 years, an annual opinion survey says.But the NatCen British Social Attitudes Report found a majority of the 2,878 people it surveyed would not reverse cuts made by the current government.NatCen said people ""seemingly accepted many of the coalition's big reforms"".But during five years of seeing a coalition in action, the number who preferred to have a coalition in charge had ""plummeted"" from 45% to 29%.NatCen also said that, while most people wanted to stay in the EU, ""the majority of the public can be considered Eurosceptic"".The British Social Attitudes survey has been carried out every year since 1983, with questions repeated periodically to assess how opinions change over time.This year's study aimed to find how people had responded to the Conservative/Liberal Democrat coalition government.Among its findings were:Recent opinion polls suggest a hung Parliament is likely after the 7 May general election, which could lead to another coalition government.NatCen, a social research specialist, said the number of people who preferred this form of government had ""plummeted"", adding: ""Apparently any hopes that the Liberal Democrats might have had that voters would come to accept coalitions once they saw one in action, have been dashed by the experience of the last five years.""However, it said people's responses to the coalition question were likely to be influenced by the party they supported.NatCen said there had been a ""muted"" response to the government's reforms of the NHS, welfare and higher education.Rachel Ormston, one of the report's authors, said: ""Despite the fact that the public has gone off the notion of coalition government, it has seemingly accepted many of the coalition's big reforms.""In spite of the government's narrative of austerity, or perhaps because of it, NHS satisfaction is back up, there is broad acceptance of tuition fees, and at least some cuts to benefits are popular.""For the first time, this year's report also looked specifically at the attitudes of UKIP supporters, who featured heavily enough in the sample to be assessed separately.It found while they were ""anti-immigration and socially conservative"", they shared traits with Labour supporters in that they were predominantly working class and concerned about the gap between rich and poor.They were also more likely than the population as a whole to support the death penalty (75% to 48%), consider young people do not have enough respect for British values (86% to 66%), and believe that people who want to have children should get married (46% to 23%).UKIP supporters were also less likely to trust Parliament and the government.People's interest in politics is ""undiminished"", the survey said, but a trend towards ""greater voter disconnection"" had continued in this Parliament, with 53% of people saying the government does not much care ""what people like me think"".Some 14% of people have expressed political views online, and 40% got political news from the internet at least every week, compared to 64% from television and 46% from newspapers.For this year's report, NatCen interviewed a representative, random sample of 2,878 adults in the UK between August and November 2014."
2015-04-01,MPs warn on growth of UK jihadists,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32059813,"Not enough is being done to prevent people leaving the UK to join Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, a group of MPs has warned.Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said Britain must win their ""hearts and minds"".The committee's report comes as the BBC launches a database tracking British jihadists in Syria and Iraq. It shows that many people left in clusters from certain UK areas - often due to friendships and peer groups. The MPs' report argued that preventative work with communities, families and international partners was ""vital"" and needs to be a top priority for the Home Office.  ""The number of cases being brought to public attention should ring alarm bells,"" said Labour MP Mr Vaz.  ""This must be a relentless battle for hearts and minds, and without a strong counter-narrative we are in danger of failing to prevent even more departures. We are at the edge of a cliff."" The BBC has been tracking the stories of the men, women, boys and girls who have gone to Syria and Iraq to understand why they go, where they go from and what happens to them. By analysing around 160 profiles, it reveals the way in which people have travelled in clusters - a group of three young friends from Coventry, another group from Portsmouth, drawn out by one person they knew, others in Cardiff linked to people involved in an extremist organisation. Social media might play a part but face-to-face contact appears just as, if not more, important, according to the database.It includes the stories of: The BBC research emphasises the extent to which real-world contacts, rather than just online connections, are often a key driver of radicalisation and intent to travel to Iraq and Syria. Some of the experts who appeared before the Home Affairs Committee also argued the internet was a secondary influence. They said that universities and prisons were among the two most significant places where radicalisation occurred. A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police, which was not aware of the report, said it would have ""welcomed the opportunity"" to have given evidence to the committee and that it planned to look at the report in detail.The disappearance of schoolgirls Shamima Begum, Amira Abase, both 15, and Kadiza Sultana, 16, from east London in February, raised questions as to who could have done more to prevent their departure. After taking evidence from the police and the families of the girls among others, Mr Vaz said their case suffered from a ""lack of immediate action"". He added: ""Schools and the police must inform parents immediately, and work with them even if there is the smallest hint of radicalisation, or a close association with someone who is thought to have been radicalised.""However, the Met Police spokesman defended the speed of the police response to the schoolgirls' disappearance.  He said the committee's criticism was ""misleading"", pointing to the evidence given by both UK and Turkish authorities of ""rapid exchanges"" between the two.The committee's report said there needed to be an advice service which would be a less extreme step than calling the anti-terrorist hotline.The Association of Chief Police Officer's lead officer for the government's anti-terror strategy Prevent, Chief Constable Sir Peter Fahy, agreed that more needed to be done.However, he said the police ""do not have the capacity"" to routinely work with every school in the country.He added: ""The police service will play its part but the prime responsibility for dissuading young people from getting involved in extremist activity has to lie with parents, families and carers.""The committee also pointed to weaknesses in information sharing with airlines and other countries. It said greater care needed to be taken at airport check-in desks when people were travelling to destinations of concern - namely Syria, Somalia, Iraq and Nigeria, as well as neighbouring countries, such as Turkey. The report said police also needed to work faster to alert overseas partners and airlines when there were concerns over individuals.There were signs that some of the girls had followed extremist accounts on social media, the report said.The committee said that social media companies, such as Facebook and Twitter, should be prepared to suspend accounts when there is evidence they are being used to promote violent extremism.  The report also said it was disappointed the Home Office had not implemented a programme for individuals returning to Britain where there is evidence they had fought in Syria.Security officials estimate that some 600 Britons have left the country to join IS - and while around half may have returned, many are still out there - and some have died.  The BBC project includes detailed profiles of individuals which can be searched, based on hometown, age and gender, as well as those who have been convicted in the courts or who are believed to have been killed."
2015-04-01,Ruling due on Prince Charles letters,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32061819,"The Supreme Court is set to rule on whether Prince Charles's letters to government should be made public.The UK's highest court has been asked to judge whether the Attorney General's office acted unlawfully when it prevented their publication in 2012.The Guardian newspaper is seeking the disclosure of the letters written to government departments between 2004-5.It has been argued that releasing the so-called ""black spider memos"" would undermine the prince.The Guardian said it had been ""pressing the government"" for 10 years to see the letters, written by the Prince of Wales to seven government departments.He is heir to the throne and, as the royal family's own website explains, it is central to the British constitution that the reigning monarch should remain politically neutral.The former Attorney General Dominic Grieve has said that any perception the prince had disagreed with the then Labour government in 2004-5 ""would be seriously damaging to his role as future monarch because if he forfeits his position of political neutrality as heir to the throne, he cannot easily recover it when he is king"".By BBC royal correspondent Peter HuntAfter 10 years, several court cases, and a cost to the taxpayer of hundreds of thousands of pounds, an end appears to be in sight for this dogged pursuit of Prince Charles's black spider memos.A final resolution will only be delayed if there's a referral on an issue of European law to the Court of Justice in Luxembourg. If not, the prince's private letters will either remain confidential, as the sender intended, or they'll be exposed to a large and inquisitive audience. His friends say he has a right and a duty to communicate with the government of the day. His critics accuse him of meddling and argue the way he operates should be transparent.One day, as things stand, he'll be king.As that day draws closer, the influence Prince Charles attempts to exert on ministers - and attempt he does - has greater relevance and significance.

2015-04-01,Tories and Labour VAT and NI pledges,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32047995,"David Cameron ruled out an increase in VAT if he retains power at the general election in his final Commons clash with Ed Miliband before polling day.The prime minister said this was a ""clear promise"" and challenged the Labour leader to rule out increasing National Insurance.Mr Miliband said ""nobody would believe"" Mr Cameron's pledge, because his government had raised VAT in 2010.Labour later announced it would not put National Insurance up.Mr Cameron's announcement was designed to neutralise one of Labour's main lines of attack - as seen on an election poster unveiled this week - that the Conservatives are secretly plotting to increase VAT because they will not be able to make their spending cut plans work without it.The announcement appeared to take Conservative MPs by surprise, especially after Chancellor George Osborne repeatedly declined to rule out a VAT increase when questioned by MPs on Tuesday.Analysis by political correspondent Iain WatsonToday's exchange actually raises more questions than it answers.If the main parties are ruling out further potential sources of revenue, but still committing themselves to eradicating a £90bn black hole in the public finances, will they now be under more pressure during the election campaign to spell out in much greater detail exactly what they intend to cut?Read Iain's full blogThe Conservatives have repeatedly accused Labour of secretly plotting to increase National Insurance contributions - but shadow chancellor Ed Balls has now ruled this out.Speaking just over an hour after Prime Minister's Questions, he told BBC News: ""We will make it clear in the manifesto Labour will not be raising NI. That will be a clear pledge from us.""He accused Mr Cameron of making an ""out of the blue, panicky"" announcement on VAT that ""no one in Britain will believe"".Labour, which has already announced plans to increase the top rate of income tax and impose a new ""mansion tax"" on high value properties, insists its plans are fully costed and will not require additional tax hikes if it wins May's general election.Mr Miliband began his final head-to-head encounter with Mr Cameron before the election by joking that the PM had ""announced his retirement plans"" - a reference to a BBC interview in which the prime minister said he would not serve a third term if the Tories remained in power.Challenging Mr Cameron to give a ""straight answer to a straight question"", Mr Miliband pressed him on whether he would rule out a rise in VAT after the election, as Labour had done.In response, the prime minister immediately said ""yes"", prompting loud cheers in turn from the Conservative benches. He contrasted what he said was a ""clear promise"" with Labour's unwillingness to rule out a rise in National Insurance.""I answered a very simple question about VAT. I ruled out an increase... straight answer to him, straight question from me. I have ruled out VAT. Will he rule out national insurance contributions. Yes or no?"" Mr Cameron added: ""We all know this is Labour's job tax. This is their tax of choice. This is what they clobber working people, families and enterprises with.""But Mr Miliband responded by saying there was ""only one person who is going to raise taxes on working families and that is him"".He said nobody would believe Mr Cameron on VAT ""because of his extreme spending plans, because his numbers do not add up and because he promised it last time and broke his promise"".Mr Cameron, he added, had broken other promises made before the last election to reduce annual net migration below 100,000 and not to pursue a major structural re-organisation of the NHS, adding that it was ""time for a better plan and time for a Labour government"".But Mr Cameron suggested a future Labour government would result in the ""chaos of economic crisis"", with Ed Miliband being ""held hostage"" by the SNP.The packed session provided a last opportunity for the two men to rally their MPs and set out their arguments before the start of the election campaign next week.Speaking after the exchanges and the other parties' tax pledges, deputy prime minister Nick Clegg said the Lib Dems ""don't need to raise VAT, national insurance or headline rates of income tax or corporation tax either"".""There are other taxes and other tax loopholes that we can increase or close in order to balance the books,"" he said. Parliament is expected to be prorogued on Thursday ahead of a six-week campaign culminating in the 7 May poll.The next PMQs is not expected to take place until the end of May, once the make-up of the new government has been decided.

2015-04-01,Met police 'had files on MPs in 90s',https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32044580,"A former undercover police officer has told BBC News that Scotland Yard kept intelligence files on MPs during the 1990s. Ex-Special Branch officer Peter Francis says he saw files on 10 Labour MPs which he and others regularly updated. He says he personally gathered information on three MPs as part of his work infiltrating left-wing groups. The MPs named, and Labour, have called for a forthcoming public inquiry into undercover policing to be widened. Mr Francis operated undercover between 1993 and 1997 in the Met's now disbanded Special Demonstration Squad. He was told to embed himself in left-wing groups or causes that were deemed to pose a potential threat to security. He says that during this period he was told to gather intelligence on MPs and their activities if and when they featured in any of his operations. That information, he says, was added to a special pink file that was available for Special Branch officers to read. Between 1990 and 2001, he claims to have personally seen records relating to Diane Abbott, the late Tony Benn, Jeremy Corbyn, the late Bernie Grant, Peter Hain, Harriet Harman, Ken Livingstone, Joan Ruddock, Dennis Skinner and Jack Straw.Four of the group became ministers during Mr Francis's time in Special Branch - including Jack Straw who was home secretary after 1997. ""When I was deployed undercover in the Special Demonstration Squad, any MP that I came across, such as on demonstrations, I would report back on them,"" he said. Mr Francis says that the files not only contained the MPs' publicly-stated political views - but also intelligence on what was going on behind the scenes in the party or their group. He says some of the information would have been things said in private by the MP, depending on how close each undercover officer had been able to get. Mr Francis said that when he first saw the files he understood that each had probably been created before the individual was an MP because of their personal involvement in radical causes or protests.But he added: ""When they became MPs these files carried on. It [was] your duty as an SDS officer to report back any intelligence that you come across. ""I felt that it was OK to report back on MPs,"" he said. ""I used to give myself a pat on the back, thinking 'I have done a good job'. These MPs were spied on and they should know.""""I don't think the police force should be monitoring MPs, full stop. I don't think we have any right to do that at all. It may be justifiable to say that the Security Service should be doing it - but I certainly don't think the police should be doing it.""Scotland Yard has refused to comment on the substance of the claims, but a spokesman said it had not shied away from serious allegations about the SDS. It said that Operation Herne, the internal police investigation into what happened in the unit, remained an ongoing investigation.""Operation Herne maintains that without speaking to Peter Francis it is simply not possible to fully investigate allegations he makes,"" said a spokesman. ""Operation Herne remains very willing to engage with him.""Mr Francis said that he has refused to speak to Operation Herne because he fears being interviewed under caution as a suspect, rather than a whistleblower. Scotland Yard told the BBC that Operation Herne detectives would be prepared to speak to him as a witness. He has, however, spoken to Mark Ellison QC who reviewed allegations about the SDS for the Home Secretary Theresa May - prompting her to launch a statutory inquiry. He says he will appear before those hearings. Peter Hain, who was a leader of the anti-apartheid movement in the late 1960s and 70s and became an MP in 1991, said he now wants full answers from Scotland Yard. ""I was deeply disturbed to find that files were still being kept by the Special Branch while I and others were serving Members of Parliament,"" he said. ""That is constitutionally an outrage. It infringes the sovereignty of Parliament. ""I want to see the home secretary widen the scope of the inquiry into the SDS to look specifically at the surveillance of MPs and the fact that there were active files on us while we were serving Members of Parliament. ""This should never have happened and it should have been reported and properly authorised - and we don't know whether it was.""Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper echoed the call for the inquiry to be widened in light of what she described as ""extremely serious and disturbing allegations"".""While undercover policing remains a crucial tool in combating serious and organised crime it must not be abused,"" she said.""There have now been a series of serious allegations about undercover policing - ranging from the treatment of Stephen Lawrence's family to police having long-term inappropriate relationships. ""We called some time ago for much stronger oversight of undercover policing and it is also vital to get to the truth about what has happened."" Mrs May announced earlier this month that Lord Justice Pitchford would lead the inquiry into the SDS allegations - but the precise shape of that inquiry is not yet clear.A Home Office spokesman said the review by Mark Ellison QC had unearthed ""serious historical failings"". ""That is why the Home Secretary established a public inquiry to thoroughly investigate undercover policing and the operation of the Special Demonstration Squad. ""Lord Justice Pitchford will consult interested parties to the inquiry over the coming months on setting the terms of reference, with a view to publishing these at the end of July.""Undercover policing is an essential tactic in the fight against crime but to improve the public's confidence in undercover work we must ensure there is no repeat of these failings in the future."""
2015-04-01,NHS problems worst 'since 1990s',https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/health-32057948,"Services in the NHS in England are deteriorating in a way not seen since the early 1990s, according to a leading health think tank. The King's Fund review said waiting times for A&E, cancer care and routine operations had all started getting worse, while deficits were growing.It said such drops in performance had not been seen for 20 years.But the think tank acknowledged the NHS had done as well as could be expected, given the financial climate.Professor John Appleby, chief economist at the King's Fund, which specialises in health care policy, said: ""The next government will inherit a health service that has run out of money and is operating at the very edge of its limits. ""There is now a real risk that patient care will deteriorate as service and financial pressures become overwhelming.""He said in terms of how standards were slipping - not how low they had reached - the situation was the worst it had been since the ""early 1990s"".The report noted much of the deterioration has happened in the second-half of the Parliament with many measures of performance being maintained in the first few years.It said the next government had to address the funding situation, adding the extra £8bn a year NHS England says is needed by 2020, was the ""minimum"" that would be required.The report - a review of performance this Parliament - highlights a range of problems as well as achievements. These include:The report is the second part of the King's Fund pre-election review of the NHS this Parliament.Last month it warned the coalition government's reforms of the health service had been ""damaging and distracting"".The King's Fund report should make worrying reading. The reference to the 1990s conjures up images of - for the NHS at least - a bygone era. The think tank's point was not that waiting times had reached the level they were at then, rather that this is the first time in two decades of almost continuous improvement that there has been a sustained drop in performance.In many ways, that had to happen. Services cannot keep getting better for ever. Nonetheless, the findings are crystal clear: the NHS is at a critical juncture. But what is less easy to determine is to what extent the coalition's policies have contributed to the difficulties.The think tank has already provided a critical analysis of the government's reforms - and when pushed, acknowledged the health service may have been ""in better shape"" if they had not happened.But the more significant issue for the health of the health service this Parliament has been the squeeze on finances. Even though the budget has been increased, it has felt more like a cut to many because demands have risen so quickly.On this though, the King's Fund accepted that the government's hands were tied. Given the state of the economy, ministers did as much as they could have.Read more from NickRoyal College of Nursing general secretary Peter Carter said politicians needed to take note of the warnings made by the King's Fund.""Morale is low, and more and more staff are being made sick with stress because of the intolerable pressure they are under,"" he added. Katherine Murphy, of the Patients Association, said: ""The findings echo what we are hearing on a daily basis on our helpline. It is clear to the public that the future of the NHS is one of the most important issues facing the nation and it should be a central issue in the election campaign.""Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham said: ""Five years ago David Cameron stood on a promise to protect the NHS. This report provides authoritative proof that he has broken that promise.""But a Department of Health spokesman said: ""As the King's Fund says, the NHS has 'performed well in the face of huge challenges', but if we are to continue to invest in the NHS going forward it needs to be backed by a strong economy.""

2015-04-01,SNP 'could block Tory government',https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32045419,"The SNP would block a minority Conservative government by voting down its Queen's Speech if it holds the post-election balance of power, its former leader Alex Salmond has said.Mr Salmond said the move could bring down the government if Labour joined in, with David Cameron ""locked out"".The Conservatives accused him of ""trying to sabotage the democratic will of the British people"".Labour has called his balance of power prediction ""bluster and bluff"".In recent days Mr Salmond, who is bidding to become a Westminster MP at the 7 May general election, has claimed his party could ""hold the power"" in a hung Parliament and would be able to influence the Budget of a minority Labour government.This was dismissed by Labour leader Ed Miliband, who has ruled out a formal coalition with the Scottish nationalists.The SNP currently has six MPs at Westminster, but recent opinion polls suggest its share could increase dramatically at the general election.James Cook, BBC News Scotland correspondentIf the Conservatives attempt to form a minority government and enough MPs vote against their Queen's Speech the administration would fall at the first hurdle and the leader of the opposition would have a shot at forming a government.That's how parliamentary democracy works in the event of a hung Parliament.And yet the Conservatives are saying that by planning to vote against a government he opposes Alex Salmond has ""confirmed he would sabotage the democratic will of the British people in order to make Ed Miliband prime minister"".It is part of their continuing attempt to portray Mr Miliband as a weak leader whose strings are being pulled by Mr Salmond.This kind of language causes despair among Tories north of the border who fear that the party in London is waltzing into an SNP trap.They know that many voters in Scotland will read the phrase ""democratic will of the British people"" and hear ""democratic will of the English people"".Because, if it is illegitimate for Scottish MPs, from whatever party, to vote against one government and support another in the British parliament, then what, voters may ask, is the point of the union?Who is dancing to Mr Salmond's tune now?Mr Salmond, the former Scottish first minister, told the New Statesman that in the event of a hung Parliament, a minority Conservative government would have to ""go straight effectively for a vote of confidence - usually the Queen's Speech, although it could be otherwise, of course - and we'd be voting against.""If David Cameron lost this vote, he said, there would be a two-week period for another government to be formed.BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said Mr Salmond had ""hardened his anti-Conservative rhetoric"" in the interview.A Conservative spokesman said:  ""Alex Salmond has confirmed he would sabotage the democratic will of the British people in order to make Ed Miliband prime minister. ""That would mean chaos for Britain, with weak Ed Miliband dancing to Alex Salmond's tune.""He said the ""only way to keep Britain together"" was to vote Conservative.Mr Salmond's latest comments come after Mr Miliband said the only people writing a future Labour Budget would be himself and shadow chancellor Ed Balls.Speaking in Clydebank on Monday, he added: ""It's not going to be Alex Salmond - not in a million years."""

Its chairman, Conservative MP Sir William Cash, said the BBC had ""very particular obligations"" to be impartial and to ""educate and inform"".He added:  ""We do not believe this is currently being achieved in the context of the BBC's EU coverage.""A BBC spokesman said the corporation provided extensive and impartial coverage of European and Parliamentary issues, and it would be a breach of the corporation's independence if a committee of MPs instructed the BBC on its coverage."

Speaking ahead of the register's launch, Alison White conceded a lot of lobbyists would not be listed on it.But she said her job was to make sure the rules were implemented and she would do so with ""extreme verve and vigour.""But one critic of the register said it was ""fake"" and full of ""loopholes"".Lobbyists are companies or individuals paid to influence government decisions.The coalition promised to introduce a statutory register of lobbyists when it came to power in 2010, and legislation was passed last year, with ministers saying the move would help clean up politics.However, the new register will only cover consultant lobbyists and will not apply to lobbyists working ""in-house"" for companies or organisations.A person or company will only need to be registered if they are contacting a government minister or permanent secretary in a government department - leading to criticism it will not come close to reflecting the scale or nature of lobbying that goes on across Whitehall.But Ms White, who is independent of the government, said her task was to implement the law as it stood not to question the powers she had been given. ""We are having something that has never been in place before,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""This is a statutory register. The industry tells me it is a professional industry. I expect them to conform with the legislation. It is my job to make sure they do so.""Ms White, who was appointed as the registrar of consultant lobbyists in September, acknowledged the register would not indicate different ""levels of lobbying"".""The legislation was quite narrowly drafted to address a particular issue, which was that it was not always particularly clear, when ministers were being lobbied, who the client of the lobbyist was. That is what the register was set up to do,"" she said.She added: ""This will give anyone who wishes to access the register the opportunity to be able to see who is lobbying and being paid for it and who their clients are. That is the main information the register will contain.""If a lobbyist sets out to influence government policy in some way, they would have to be registered. If they are not registered, then they would not be conforming. They have to go on the register before they lobby.""Ms White said last month that the register would not have any entries on its launch day but she had received more than ""20 expressions of interest"" about joining and companies and individuals might be required to sign up retrospectively.Potential registrants will be able to log on and create an account to file an ""information return"".But Tamasin Cave, from the Alliance for Lobbying Transparency coalition, said ""hardly anyone"" in the industry would be covered by the provisions of the new law. ""You have a huge commercial lobbying industry, and very few of them will have to sign up,"" she told Today.""The second flaw is that it won't show the interaction between lobbyists and government, and that is what a register is for.""It is to show the activity - who is discussing what with whom, but this shows nothing of this interaction. It is a fake register."""
2015-04-01,Car smoking ban MSP welcomes backing,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-south-scotland-32055226,"The Liberal Democrat MSP behind a bill to ban smoking in cars when children are present has welcomed the support of the Scottish government.South of Scotland MSP Jim Hume launched the members' bill in December.The government said it was ""very supportive"" of the principles of the bill, but changes could be needed to make it ""workable"".Motorists could potentially be fined £100 for breaching the rule if it becomes law.Mr Hume lodged draft proposals for a bill last May calling for a ban in Scotland on smoking in private vehicles when children under 18 were present.He said he was ""over the moon"" at the news the Scottish government would endorse the Smoking Prohibition (Children in Motor Vehicles) (Scotland) Bill.He said: ""With cross-party support and the support of many third sector organisations, there is every chance that this could be in place in the next year.""Eighty-four per cent of the 160 responses to my consultation were positive and people from across Scotland have expressed their support for the move.""The bill is about guaranteeing that children in Scotland can have the freedom to go on and lead healthy lives if they choose to.""I look forward to working with MSPs from all parties as the bill progresses.""Public Health Minister Maureen Watt said the Scottish government had considered including the measure in its Public Health Bill, but instead decided to support Mr Hume's proposals.She said: ""As with any bill, as it goes through the scrutiny process, there may be amendments and improvements to strengthen the legislation and ensure it is fit for purpose. ""But we believe that the underpinning principles are strong, and that is why I am pleased to support it.""Scottish Labour and a wide range of health organisations have backed his proposals.But the Scottish Conservatives have reservations about how the bill would work in practice.The party's health spokesman Jackson Carlaw said: ""While Scottish Conservatives support any moves which would protect young people from hazardous second hand smoke we have concerns as to how this would be enforced.""It would be a better use of resources to conduct a public awareness campaign similar to that which is being proposed by the government in Wales.""We will be watching this campaign in order to ascertain what lessons may be learned and what approaches may be adopted in Scotland.""Anti-smoking campaigners welcomed the Scottish government's backing for Mr Hume's bill.ASH Scotland's chief executive Sheila Duffy said: ""It is another public health initiative that can help Scotland move forward with its ambition to achieve a tobacco-free generation in 20 years' time.""It is popular with the public and will bring Scotland into line with upcoming legislation in England and Wales.""We believe it can be effectively enforced and that having the legislation focus on cars with children bypasses concerns over interference in people's private lives.""Jim Hume must be congratulated for taking the initiative on this proposal and for all the hard work he and his team have done to bring this important measure forward.""But Simon Clark, director of the smokers' group Forest, said the bill was ""legislation for legislation's sake"".He said: ""Smoking in cars carrying children is inconsiderate. The overwhelming majority of smokers know that and don't do it.""The very small number that do will carry on regardless because the law will be difficult, if not impossible, to enforce.""Education has to be better than legislation but the government prefers gesture politics and the big stick."""
2015-04-01,Candidate quits over UKIP MEP remark,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32038485,"A UKIP election candidate has quit the party over comments made by the party's only Scottish MEP about a Scottish government minister.Tim Wilson has decided not to stand in South Northamptonshire after David Coburn MEP compared Humza Yousaf to convicted terrorist Abu Hamza.Mr Coburn has apologised for the remarks, saying it was a ""joke"".A spokesman for UKIP said Mr Wilson had failed to emphasise local issues in his general election campaign.UKIP leader Nigel Farage said Mr Coburn's remarks were a ""joke in poor taste"" but he would not be taking any action against him.But Mr Wilson said he was disillusioned with the party over the ""racist jibes"" and has decided to stand down.He told BBC Scotland he was appalled by Mr Coburn's comments about Mr Yousaf and frustrated by the inaction of the party's leadership on the issue.  He said David Coburn had produced ""what I can only describe as an Islamaphobic insult, and that's simply not acceptable"".  Mr Wilson added: ""Of course he went on and apologised.  I think, frankly, that if you are in a position of power you have to be able to control what ideas emerge from your head and how they get to your mouth and, in fact, you shouldn't have those ideas in the first place.  ""But the real issue is that when Mr Farage was asked what he thought about this he dismissed this as a joke.  ""I don't think this is a joke. I think this is something very serious.  It may not be that this man intended to cause offence but we aren't interested in what his intentions are.  We are interested in the effect what he says has on other people and the effect is catastrophic, it's appalling and I've resigned.""In his resignation letter, Mr Wilson said he had been ""systematically gagged by the party whip"" and forbidden to speak about Islam favourably. A spokesman for UKIP said Mr Wilson had failed to put more emphasis on local issues in his campaign.He said: ""Whilst we had initially been optimistic about Tim Wilson's abilities as a candidate, it became obvious in recent weeks that he was out of his depth in representing our party in the way we would expect. ""Mr Wilson had clearly misunderstood the expectations that UKIP place on all of its candidates. Principal amongst those is focusing on issues that are relevant to local voters. UKIP put huge emphasis on local issues and Mr Wilson was unwilling to follow UKIP guidelines in this respect.""Last week MSPs at the Scottish Parliament unanimously condemned the remarks made by Mr Coburn during a newspaper interview.MSPs were debating a motion celebrating Scotland's diverse communities.The president of the European Parliament, Martin Schulz, condemned the remarks, saying they were ""not worthy of any elected member"". But a spokesman for the president said he could not act on remarks made outside parliament.The move comes just days after another candidate, Jonathan Stanley, quit in protest at the ""racist filth"" in UKIP. Mr Stanley, who was due to stand in the Cumbrian seat of Westmorland and Lonsdale, was the party's former head of policy in Scotland."

2015-04-01,Manifesto watch,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-29642613,"Political parties are putting together their manifestos for May's general election. Here's a guide to where they currently stand on the issues voters say they care about most (according to pollsters IPSOS Mori).ImmigrationConservatives:  David Cameron wants to make migrants wait four years before they can claim certain benefits, such as tax credits, Universal Credit, or get access to social housing. He wants to stop migrants from claiming child benefit for dependents living outside the UK, and remove those that have failed to find work after six months. Mr Cameron has promised to put reform of EU free movement rules at the heart of his renegotiation of Britain's relationship with the EU. He has ruled out a temporary cap on migrant numbers or an ""emergency brake"" on EU freedom of movement rules - ideas both mooted in recent months, saying this would be less ""effective"" than reducing the incentives for people to come to the UK. The party has a continuing goal to bring net immigration down to below 100,000 people a year (it currently stands at 243,000).Labour: ""Stronger"" border controls to tackle illegal immigration with ""proper"" entry and exit checks. ""Smarter"" targets to reduce low-skilled migration but ensure university students and high-skilled workers are not deterred. Employment agencies who only recruit abroad will be outlawed while the fines for employing illegal immigrants will be increased.Lib Dems: Reintroduce exit checks at borders, so the government can identify people who are overstaying their visa. Will require all new claimants for Jobseekers Allowance to have their English language skills assessed, with JSA then being conditional on attending language courses for those whose English is poor. Ensure that EU migrants have to ""earn"" their entitlement to benefits.SNP: Allow the devolved government to have control over immigration to Scotland, and introduce a Canadian-style earned citizenship system to attract highly-skilled immigrants.Plaid Cymru: Oppose a points-based system. Support the right of asylum seekers to work in Wales while they wait for status decisions to be made. Lobby the Westminster government to ensure that they shut ""detention"" centres.UKIP: Introduce an Australian-style points policy, used to select migrants with the skills and attributes needed to work in the country - covering people from inside and outside the EU. Bring net immigration down to 50,000 people a year. Priority lanes for UK passport holders. Increase UK border staff by 2,500. Tougher English language tests for migrants seeking permanent residence. Opt out of the Dublin treaty to allow the UK to return asylum seekers to other EU countries without considering their claim. Anyone who currently has the legal right to live, work, or study in the UK would not face deportation in the event of the country's withdrawal from the EU.Greens:  Progressively reduce UK immigration controls. Migrants illegally in the UK for over five years will be allowed to remain unless they pose a serious danger to public safety. More legal rights for asylum seekers.Taxes and the economyConservatives: Eradicate the deficit by 2018 and secure an overall budget surplus by 2019-20. Achieve this by spending cuts, not tax rises, while raising NHS spending. An income tax cut for 30 million people by 2020. Tax would start to kick in at £12,500 a year, instead of £10,500. This will cost £5.6bn. The higher tax rate, 40%, would start at £50,000 instead of £41,900, again by 2020, at a cost of £1.6bn. This will be paid for through £25bn in additional spending cuts and economic growth. No increases in VAT.Labour: Get the current budget into surplus and the national debt falling ""as soon as possible in the next parliament"". No additional borrowing for new spending. Reintroduce the 50p top rate of income tax for earnings over £150,000.  Cut income tax for 24 million people by bringing back the 10p rate, paid for by scrapping the Married Couples' Tax Allowance. Bring in a ""mansion tax"" on properties worth over £2m, to raise £1.2bn. A tax on bankers' bonuses. A 5% pay cut for every government minister. Push for UK overseas territories to be put on an international blacklist if they refuse to co-operate with a drive against tax avoidance. No increases in VAT or National Insurance contributions.Lib Dems: Raise the personal allowance - the point at which you start paying income tax - to £11,000 in April 2016 and then to £12,500 by 2020. ""Strict new fiscal rules"" to ensure the deficit has gone by April 2018, with the wealthy contributing the most. The Lib Dems invented the ""mansion tax"" but in contrast to Labour have set out how it would operate - along similar lines to council tax bands. There are also Lib Dem plans to increase capital gains tax - paid on profits from second homes or shares - from 28% to 35%. Impose an additional 8% rate of corporation tax on UK banks to raise an extra £1bn a year to help pay off the deficit.SNP: Oppose UK plans in the Infrastructure Bill which will allow oil and gas drilling and hydraulic fracturing beneath people's homes without consent. Invest in offshore wind farming. Support an international bank tax and limits to industry bonuses.Plaid Cymru: Build a Green Skills Construction College, specialising in green energy. Establish a publicly-owned energy company. Establish a publicly-owned Bank of Wales business investment bank. Enforce a living wage. Give devolved nations an equal say in institutions that affect everyone's lives, such as the Bank of England.UKIP: Increase the personal allowance to the level of full-time minimum wage earnings, about £13,500, by 2020. Abolish inheritance tax. Introduce a 35% income tax rate between £42,285 and £55,000, at which point the 40% rate becomes payable. Set up a Treasury Commission to design a turnover tax on large businesses. Cut foreign aid budget by £9bn a year. Scrap HS2. Save £8bn a year in membership fees by leaving the EU.  Lower the VAT rate charged on restorations to listed buildings.Greens: People earning more than £100,000 a year would pay 50% income tax. Wealth tax of 1% to 2% on people worth £3m or more. Renationalise the railways and energy companies. Scrap HS2. Allow councils to impose extra business rates on out-of-town supermarkets to fund small local businesses. Crackdown on tax avoidance by multinationals. Allow ""the current dependence on economic growth to cease, and allow zero or negative growth to be feasible without individual hardship"". Commit Britain to a ""zero carbon"" future. Cut rail and bus fares by an average of 10%. Enforce a cap on bankers' bonuses.The NHSConservatives:  Chancellor George Osborne says he will put an extra £2bn into frontline health services across the UK, which he described as a ""down payment"" on a plan drawn up by NHS bosses calling for an extra £8bn a year above inflation by 2020. In England, everyone would be able to see a GP seven days a week by 2020. Recruit 5,000 more doctors.Labour:  Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said Labour would commit an extra £2.5bn a year above Mr Osborne's plan. The money will come from three sources - a new ""mansion"" tax, clamping down on tax avoidance by big corporations and a new tax on tobacco companies. Patients in England would get a GP appointment within 48 hours and would not have to wait longer than a week for cancer tests and results. Scrap the Health and Social Care Act and end ""creeping privatisation"" of the NHS.  Integrate health and social care services into a system of ""whole-person care"". Give greater priority to mental health services. Replace the Cancer Drugs Fund in England when it runs out in 2016 with a £330m fund to improve access to innovative cancer drugs, surgery and radiotherapy. Recruit 5,000 more healthcare workers to help patients stay in their homes and introduce new safety checks to identify people at risk of hospitalisation. Prioritise child mental health by increasing the proportion of the mental health budget spent on children.Lib Dems: An extra £1bn for the NHS every year, to be funded by - amongst other things - making higher earners pay more tax on their shares. Half of this will go towards mental health. Ensure that spending on the NHS rises in line with growth in the economy. People who need therapy for conditions such as depression will be guaranteed treatment within 18 weeks. For young patients experiencing psychosis for the first time treatment will be provided within two weeks of being referred by a GP. This is all going to happen from April, with more mental health targets to follow if the Lib Dems return to government. Wants a cross-party review of the future of NHS funding.SNP: Reduce the number of senior managers in the NHS by 25% over the next parliament. Streamline the work of health boards. Real terms increases in year-on-year NHS spending.Plaid Cymru: Recruit 1,000 extra doctors to the Welsh NHS over two terms of a Plaid government. Offer financial incentives for recruiting doctors to areas and specialisms where there are, or are predicted to be, shortages. Encourage innovation and attract more research funding, in part by increasing research and development funding as government finance allows. Improve training for postgraduate doctors and stop them being used to ""plug gaps"" in staff rotas. More recruitment from within the EU to fill vacancies and using international doctors to staff the NHS while a new generation of Welsh doctors are trained.UKIP: An extra £3bn per year in NHS funding paid for by quitting the EU and through ""middle management"" cuts. Keep NHS free at the point of delivery. Stop any further use of PFI, and encourage local authorities to buy out their PFI contracts early where it is affordable to do so. Ensure all visitors and migrants who have been here for fewer than five years have NHS-approved medical insurance as a condition of entry to UK, with £200m of the £2bn saved to be spent on ending hospital parking charges in England. Bring back state-enrolled nurses and return powers to matrons. Monitor and Care Quality Commission to be replaced with elected county health boards. Stop spending £90m a year on gastric band and breast enhancement operations.Greens: Funding to be diverted away from centralised facilities towards community healthcare, illness prevention and health promotion.  Stop privatisation. Abolish prescription charges. Dedicated NHS Tax to go direct to the health service. Ban proactive recruitment of non-British NHS staff from overseas. A complete ban on the promotion of tobacco and alcohol products, including sponsorship.Security, defence and foreign affairsConservatives: Hold a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU by 2017, after negotiating the return of some powers from Brussels. Protect foreign aid budget. Replace Trident.Labour:  Push for reform of European Union and prevent Britain from ""sleepwalking"" towards exit. Commit in law to holding a Strategic Defence and Security Review every 5 years. Outlaw discrimination and abuse of Armed Forces personnel.Lib Dems: Campaign to reduce the number of Trident nuclear submarines. Push for greater European Union efficiency. SNP: Oppose nuclear weapons and push for removal of Trident submarines from Scotland. In 2010, proposed a Scottish Centre for Reconciliation and Conflict Resolution, to promote peaceful alternatives to armed conflict. Maintain 0.7% commitment to foreign aid. Enhanced role for Scotland within the UK in Europe, particularly in fisheries policy.Plaid Cymru: Honour commitment of 0.7% of budget used for foreign aid. Campaign for cancellation of developing countries' debts. Support the Fair Trade movement. Support the 'Tobin' or 'Robin hood' tax as a means of encouraging more responsibility and stability in the global markets. Reform the IMF and World Bank in order to improve regulation and accountability. Continue membership of the EU, but campaign for democratic reform. Support minority nations and minority language speakers around the world. Pass a Military Wellbeing Act to promote and safeguard the physical and mental health and wellbeing of military personnel.UKIP:  Leave the European Union. Remove the passports of any person who has gone to fight for a terrorist organisation and deport anyone who has committed a terrorist act. Cut foreign aid budget by £9bn. Create a Veterans Department to look after the interests of ex-service men and women.Greens: Referendum on Britain's EU membership. Want reform of EU to hand powers back to local communities. Boost overseas aid to 1% of GDP within 10 years. Scrap Britain's nuclear weapons. Take the UK out of NATO unilaterally. End the so-called ""special relationship"" between the UK and the US.  Stop EU-US free trade deal TTIP. JobsConservatives: Create three million apprenticeships to be paid for by benefit cuts.Labour: Guarantee a job for under 25s unemployed for over a year and adults unemployed for more than two years. As many young people to go on an apprenticeship as currently go to university by 2025. Create a million new high technology, green jobs by 2025. Ban ""exploitative"" zero hour contracts.Lib Dems: An extra £1 an hour for the lowest paid apprentices. Campaign to create a million more jobs.SNP: Introduce gender quotas on public boards. Living wage ""a central priority"" in all Scottish government contracts. Continue the 'small business bonus'.Plaid Cymru: Provide rates relief for small businesses. Increase the number and value of contracts from Welsh public bodies that go to firms within Wales.UKIP: Allow firms to offer jobs to British workers first ""without the fear of being sued for discrimination"".Greens: A national energy conservation scheme to create thousands of new jobs. The party wants to create ""sustainable jobs"" and promotes more local production of food and goods.Education Conservatives: Protect England's schools budget - from reception entry at age four or five to the end of GCSEs at 16 - in cash terms although funding per pupil will not keep pace with inflation. Pre-school and post 16 education not ring fenced. Convert up to 3,500 more schools judged by Ofsted to ""require improvement"" into academies. ""War on illiteracy and innumeracy"". State primary schools in England that repeatedly failed to have a proportion of year-six pupil pass times tables and writing tests be forced to become academies, or have sponsorship replaced if already an academy. Opposed to giving votes to 16 and 17-year-olds for UK-wide general elections and local elections in England.Labour:  Increase the overall education budget in England, including schools, nurseries, Sure Start and provision for 16-to 18-year-olds, by at least the rate of inflation, although per-pupil funding is not specifically protected, meaning some of the increase will be eaten up by rising pupil numbers. Parents of primary school children would be guaranteed childcare from 8am to 6pm. The amount of free childcare for three and four year olds would be increased from 15 to 25 hours a week. Compulsory sex and relationship education in all schools. Refuse to grant business rate relief to independent schools unless they can show a ""meaningful impact"" on state schools through a new School Partnership Standard, for example by lending teaching staff or assisting in university admissions procedures.

Look at ways to strengthen the teaching of Welsh history and culture. Oppose foundation schools, academies and free schools. Look at moving from a per-pupil funding mechanism to a funding model based on the catchment area.

Supports lowering the voting age to 16 for elections to the Welsh Assembly and the UK Parliament.UKIP: More grammar schools. Scrap sex education for children aged under seven. Scrap tuition fees for students from poorer backgrounds who take degree courses in the sciences, technology, maths or engineering. Greater emphasis on vocational education with new Apprenticeship Qualification Option. School governing boards must be made up of at least 30% parents of children at the school.

Ban on zero-hours contracts which stop people getting work elsewhere. Raise the personal allowance - the point at which you start paying income tax - to £11,000 in April 2016 and then to £12,500 by 2020, which means that if you work on minimum wage for 30 hours you will pay no income tax. Young people out of work, education or training for six months will have to do unpaid community work to get benefits. This will apply to about 50,000 18 to 21-year-olds.

UKIP: Only pay child benefit for the first two children for new claimants. Increase the Carers' Allowance to the same level as Jobseekers' Allowance (JSA) and pay a higher rate of JSA if you've been in work and already made tax and National Insurance contributions. Prevent anyone taking up permanent residence in Britain unless they're able to support themselves and any dependents they bring with them for at least five years and stop them receiving benefits. Stop paying child benefit for children who don't live in Britain. Scrap what UKIP calls the ""detested bedroom tax"". Boost ""credit unions"".Greens: The party backs a Citizen's Income, a fixed amount of £72 income a week to be paid to every individual, whether they are in work or not, to be funded by higher taxes on the better off and green levies.  But in the short-term it would increase the minimum wage to £10 by 2020. Ban zero hours contracts. Axe the ""bedroom tax"". Abolish the work capability assessment and restore the level of the former disability living allowance.

2015-04-01,Elephant trap?,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32047998,"The campaign has not even got under way, yet in the space of a couple of hours we have now been treated to not only one election pledge, but to two. The prime minister ruled out raising VAT if re-elected - while Labour said National Insurance contributions wouldn't go up.Usually politicians fudge the question of tax rises.  When he was leader of the opposition David Cameron himself said ""we have no need to raise taxes"" - before hiking up VAT after polling day.Famously, John Major said he had ""no plans"" to put up the sales tax -  before his chancellor did just that.And when he appeared in front of the cross-party Treasury committee of MPs on Tuesday, the current chancellor seemed to be continuing that tradition.  Under repeated questioning, George Osborne said: ""The policies we have do not involve a VAT rise.""That formulation appeared to give him not so much wriggle room, but an entire wriggle mansion.Labour assumed their campaign warning of further VAT rises to come under the Tories was very much on the money.But George Osborne's allies are suggesting privately that he had, in fact, been walking Ed Miliband to the edge of an elephant trap, then beckoning the prime minister to push the opposition leader in.Ed Miliband's strategists fully expected Mr Cameron to repeat the chancellor's obfuscation on tax at the final Prime Minister's Questions of this Parliament. They would then have expanded on the theme, inviting the prime minister to answer other difficult questions - then say he wasn't being straight with the British people for avoiding them.But the Labour leader was completely wrong-footed when first the prime minister said he would rule out a VAT rise and then counter-punched, inquiring if Labour would now rule out an increase in National Insurance contributions.Ed Miliband dodged the question and what could have been downbeat Conservative benches, uneasy over the prime minister's announcement this week of his retirement plans, were given something to cheer.The reason Ed Miliband didn't respond is because he was holding the National Insurance pledge back for Labour's manifesto.But that soon became unsustainable - so the other Ed, the shadow chancellor Ed Balls, had to undertake a hasty round of the TV studios to do just that.When I spoke to him mid-tour, he put on a brave face. His view was that George Osborne, having raised VAT from 17.5% to 20%, wanted to give the issue a low profile - whereas the prime minister had now made the mistake of putting it centre stage. And he believed David Cameron's promise would be judged against his past VAT-raising performance.He defended Ed Miliband's reluctance to talk about National Insurance as he felt it would have been ""inappropriate"" to announce Labour tax policy at PMQs.So the prime minister - always a better tactician than strategist - can at least satisfy himself that he smoked Labour out on NI and disrupted at least one entry in their election campaign grid.But the exchange actually raised more questions than it answered.If the main parties are ruling out further potential sources of revenue, but still committing themselves to eradicating a £90bn black hole in the public finances, will they now be under more pressure during the election campaign to spell out in much greater detail exactly what they intend to cut?"
2015-04-01,Who's next?,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32031343,"David Cameron's declaration that he will not seek a third term in office if he retains power in May has immediately stoked interest in who might fill his shoes when he's gone. Here are the likely - and perhaps less obvious - possibilities.Claim? As chancellor of the exchequer he's the man in charge of the purse strings and master strategist - and reportedly the PM's favourite to succeed him, although he hasn't said as much. Mr Cameron's right-hand man has had an image makeover of late, with a new haircut and a diet to shed some pounds. And he has seemingly recovered from his ""omnishambles"" Budget in 2012, with his latest - and last Budget - of the parliament giving the Tories a lead in some polls. He's said to be well liked among Conservative cabinet ministers and backbench MPs, whose support is vital for any candidate wanting to take on the party leadership. He shas some work to do among grassroots Tory members, however, coming fifth in ConservativeHome's latest online poll of party members on future leaders.Latest odds: 10/1 (according to William Hill)What's he said? ""The prime minister leads a strong team but what you see from him is answering a direct question with a direct answer. I think that's really refreshing. He says he's going to serve that full five years so the real question facing the country now is do you want the strong leadership of David Cameron that's delivering zero inflation and record jobs or do you want the chaos and incompetence of Ed Miliband.""Claim? The longest-serving home secretary in 50 years, she is only the second Conservative woman to secure one of the top four jobs in government. In her role, she has talked tough on immigration and crime and taken on the Police Federation. And she is popular with Tory activists, consistently occupying either first or second place in ConservativeHome's online polls on future party leaders. There have long been claims of Mrs May positioning herself for the top job, with reported tensions between her and the prime minister. Critics say she lacks charisma and micro-manages - while some cannot forget her coining the now infamous ""nasty party"" phrase at a Tory conference in 2002, but supporters say she is a formidable operator, and have dubbed her Britain's Angela Merkel. Latest odds: 9/2What's she said? ""My view is very simple, David Cameron is a first class leader of the party and a first class prime minister and I hope he is going to be doing that for a very long time."" (Desert Island discs, 23 November 2014)Claim? The blonde bombshell and mayor of London who can seemingly reach voters that others in the party cannot. Casting aside a rather chequered past he steered the capital through the 2012 Olympics, launched the successful and popular ""Boris bikes"" and got rid of London's ""bendy buses"" in favour of the new Routemaster double deckers. Mr Johnson hopes to revive his Westminster parliamentary career at the general election. He has been tipped by many to take the helm of the Conservative Party, and has not discouraged the idea. Like Theresa May, he is also a favourite among the grassroots of the party, pipping her to the top spot in ConservativeHome's latest poll of party members on future leaders. (he's ahead by 2 points). Critics say the gaffe-prone politician is not the right man for the job, but his supporters point to his wide-spread appeal.Latest odds: 9/4What's he said? ""I think what David Cameron is saying is banal and obvious. There has already been a leader of the Conservative Party for ten years and he's done an outstanding job. What he's saying now is that he wants to serve through to 2020 and that is frankly what we need him to do... five more years is what this country needs. I'm not entirely certain I see what the story is. He was asked a straight question, are you going to serve a third term like Mrs Thatcher or Tony Blair and he said no, because he thinks that ten years on top of British politics is an incredibly long time.""Claim? A self-made millionaire and devotee of Margaret Thatcher, he is regarded as one of the Conservatives' fastest-rising stars. The Treasury minister-turned-culture secretary became the first of the 2010 intake of MPs to reach cabinet level, and the first Asian male Conservative cabinet minister. He's currently polling well among the Conservative grassroots, who voted him third most preferable leader in ConservativeHome's latest online future leader poll. David Cameron recently said he wants to see a British Asian prime minister in his lifetime.Latest odds: 12/1Claim? Currently holding one of the four great offices of state - foreign secretary - Mr Hammond's name has often cropped up whenever talk of leadership contenders has emerged. He has built up an impressive CV in government since the Conservatives came to power in 2010, being first awarded the job of transport secretary before his promotion to defence secretary where he stayed for three years. He's regarded by many commentators as being a potential candidate for the Tory right. He seems to have work to do among party activists, scoring only 4% in ConservativeHome's future leader poll.Latest odds: 12/1"
2015-04-01,Cereal number,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-magazine-monitor-31962592,"David Cameron has declared he won't seek a third term as prime minister, citing an advertising slogan for Shredded Wheat used in the UK more than 30 years ago. What's its enduring power, asks Justin Parkinson.The hotel kitchen staff are in disbelief. Someone in room 147 has ordered three Shredded Wheat. The maid transports them upstairs to find England cricketer Ian Botham waiting at a table, dressed in full whites.The maid leaves. Botham hides one of the Shredded Wheat under a napkin and winks to camera. Cue music, as the slogan ""Shredded Wheat. Bet you can't eat three"" appears.This advert and others featuring football manager Brian Clough and the actor Richard Kiel, who played Jaws in James Bond films, have not run for some time. Nestle, which owns the brand, says the last probably aired in 1984.But their message seems to have waned little. Telling the BBC he would only serve a limited time in Downing Street, David Cameron said: ""Terms are like Shredded Wheat - two are wonderful but three might just be too many.""The prime minister's reprise was unlikely to be accidental, says Thayne Forbes, joint managing director of the brand-valuation company Intangible Business. ""Everybody would empathise with the view that three Shredded Wheat would probably be too much,"" he says. ""The slogan suggests people shouldn't overdo it. It sounds modest and reasoned.""As marketing goes, it might seem counter-intuitive, as it discourages excessive consumption. But it also sounds honest and unexploitative.Other advertising slogans and themes are in wide use in public and political discourse. Examples include Marmite being a by-word for divisiveness - a ""Marmite person"" is either loved or hated. Cameron has twice referred to Ronseal - the woodcare product that does ""exactly what it says on the tin"". But Shredded Wheat, its best-known slogan having lain dormant for so long, appears to be used less often. The cereal, created in the US in the 1890s, has long been sold as good for the evolving British lifestyle. A newspaper advert in 1902 described it as ""a relief from the monotony of everlasting porridge"", while, by 1943, it was ""an ideal food for all war workers"". The 1980s saw an emphasis on ""simple, honest goodness"", while, in the 2000s, its long heritage and reliability was promoted.""It's a good association for Cameron,"" says Forbes. ""He must have been brought up on it, like lots of other people. It will be great marketing for Shredded Wheat to have the slogan used after so many years, too.""Subscribe to the BBC News Magazine's email newsletter to get articles sent to your inbox"
2015-04-01,Are you 'cosmopolitan'?,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32021853,"The rise of UKIP heralds the emergence of a new divide in British politics, with cosmopolitan voters on one side and non-cosmopolitan ones on the other, argues Jeremy Cliffe.We hear a lot about UKIP these days. The party stole the show at the local and European elections last year, then again in the autumn when it lured two Conservative MPs to defect.  In the past weeks alone there have been three much-discussed television programmes about the party: ""Meet the Ukippers"", ""Farage Fans and UKIP Lovers"" and ""100 Days of UKIP"". At the upcoming general election the party will probably increase its share of seats in Westminster - and will certainly affect the results in dozens of other constituencies by taking votes from the other parties. But ask some of those academics who have been watching UKIP's rise, and they will tell you that it is just one part of a bigger story. We are all used to the left-right divide in politics: a spectrum of different views on how much the government should tax, spend, regulate and otherwise intervene in the economy. But according to Dr Rob Ford of Manchester University, UKIP exists on a different axis, one to do with cultural rather than economic matters. This new political scale is ever more prominent in British political life.Radio 4's Analysis programmeOn the one end of it is what you might call a ""cosmopolitan"" philosophy: a relaxed, liberal attitude to issues concerning national identity (like immigration) and to questions of morality and lifestyle (like gay marriage). On the other end is a ""non-cosmopolitan"" outlook: more nationalist, socially conservative and less comfortable with social change, or in other words the ideological stance often associated with typical UKIP voters. This divide cuts across the left-right scale: there are cosmopolitan and non-cosmopolitan voters in both the Conservative and the Labour camps, which is why UKIP takes support from both.Lots of things are making this cosmopolitanism divide more important. One is that the old class-based, ideological conflict between left and right has declined. Dr James Tilley of Oxford University argues that politicians are partly to blame. The economic philosophies of the Conservative and Labour parties are so similar, he argues, that other, cultural issues are becoming more important. Another factor is the growing gap between the generations: the difference in outlook between the cosmopolitan young and less cosmopolitan, older voters is greater than it was in the past (partly due to the recent rise in levels of university education, which tend to correlate with liberal views). This trend presents the established parties with some difficult questions. As Dr Ford puts it, they ""have to try and deal with this rising value divide, particularly now that UKIP has mobilised it into the political debate."" ""They have to make a move,"" he adds, ""but any move that they make risks making their position worse with one or the other of these groups of voters."" Sound too cosmopolitan, and the parties risk losing supporters to UKIP. Try to ""out-UKIP UKIP"", and they could alienate their younger, more socially liberal supporters. So both are doing the political splits, trying to reconcile the cosmopolitans within their ranks with the non-cosmopolitans. Witness the tortuous attempts by Ed Miliband to sound tough on immigration without sounding too tough. Witness, too, the recent struggles of David Cameron to persuade social conservatives in his party that gay marriage can be an innately conservative institution. In the long-term, this divide will become less problematic. That is because over the years the country will tilt towards the cosmopolitan end of this new spectrum. So says Penny Young of NatCen, the research organisation that conducts the extensive British Social Attitudes survey. Various demographic factors explain this trend. The country as a whole is becoming more accepting of same-sex relationships. Younger voters are more relaxed about things like immigration and national identity than were previous generations when they were young, suggesting that the overall population will tilt in an internationalist direction over time. And ever more parts of the country are acquiring the ethnic and social diversity once confined to the inner cities, a trend that generally makes people more comfortable with immigration. According to Dr Ford the question is therefore: how should the main political parties navigate this period of transition? It would be wrong to simply abandon the swathes of voters at the less cosmopolitan end of the scale; voters who are usually older and more isolated than the average member of the population.Yet the politicians do need to adapt to the changing attitudes of British society and be honest with voters rather than pandering to views that, deep down, they do not share. This quandary may not decide the upcoming general election, but in the established parties savvy strategists with an eye to elections in 2020 and beyond are grappling with it nonetheless. That is a wise move."
2015-04-01,Dudley debate,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32015334,"I met Afzal Amin for the first time on Friday, but I already knew who he was. In Dudley North, the seat he was selected by the Conservatives to fight in the general election, Mr Amin had become hard to avoid. When I first looked at the local newspaper online, the pages were surrounded by ""Amin"" logos in the preferred Tory shade of blue.Not long after we met, he asked me to pose for a photo, snapped by one of his campaign team, and doubtless rapidly tweeted out to followers of the would-be MP.Perhaps no surprise that the man running such a disciplined operation has served in the army and been to Sandhurst. That was very much the message he delivered on Friday, as he addressed school and college pupils at a hustings in Dudley which I'd been invited to chair.There was combative debate, too, not least with his Labour rival, the MP Ian Austin. Both men knew the Dudley contest was critical for their respective parties; Ian Austin held the seat by just over 600 votes in 2010. Just as David Cameron was denied a majority by failing to take seats like this one, so Ed Miliband is unlikely to be in No 10 if Labour loses Dudley North.He was self-confident and fluent. The only obvious mis-step came right at the end, when he interrupted Vicky Duckworth, the Green candidate for the neighbouring seat. She expressed the opinion that politics often seemed to be about men shouting at each other; Mr Amin complained she was engaging in gender bias.A few weeks ago, one Conservative MP who knows him well and respects his talents, said Afzal Amin had warned him of the risks of over-confidence. He thought he risked running before he could walk.Well, he stumbled badly this weekend. Whatever the purpose of his contacts with the English Defence League - and he strongly disputes claims that he wanted them to hold a protest that would then be called off, for which he could then take the credit - the exposure has damaged him and, potentially, the prospects of his party re-taking the seat.In February, the EDL staged a rally against plans for a new mosque in the town. As the Mail on Sunday story makes clear, Afzal Amin pleaded with them beforehand not to hold that demonstration; but it went ahead anyway. It's what happened subsequently which will feature in Tuesday's disciplinary hearing.Over the weekend, I put his defence to a very senior Conservative source - that this was an attempt to broker a compromise in order to bring together a divided community. The arch response: Dudley isn't Kandahar.Nor do I think from my visits to the town, where I'm going to be based for the general election, will people in Dudley appreciate being painted as somewhere riven by racial discord.True, Dudley was the scene of one of England's earliest race riots. But that was in 1962. Although the controversy over replacing the mosque - currently in a converted school and inadequate for the numbers who want to worship there - has been running for a decade, community relations are generally good. Even those who don't want a new mosque didn't want the EDL protestors - nor to be fair the anti-fascist counter-demonstrators who followed them.As for the Conservative Party, the view of the national leadership is that you don't collaborate with the EDL. Not least because the Tories are still struggling to bury some historic baggage in the Black Country: Enoch Powell was an MP in Wolverhampton when he delivered his Rivers of Blood speech about immigration in 1968.Four years before that, there was the notorious election in Smethwick which the Conservatives were accused of winning by wooing white voters with an offensive rhyme suggesting who'd they'd get as a neighbour if they voted Labour. Afzal Amin grew up in Smethwick so he should be aware of that history. He was, until his suspension on Saturday, one of about 17% of Conservative parliamentary candidates who are not white. The party is proud of that, but it's still struggling to translate that into votes.Afzal Amin may believe that he can persuade the party to lift the suspension when he meets party officials on Tuesday. I have my doubts. Even if they accept his defence, will the other parties be so charitable? The allegations would follow him on the campaign trail, and make planned visits by cabinet ministers next to impossible.On Friday, just before the hustings in Dudley began, Afzal Amin gave me his business card. It introduces him as 'prospective member of Parliament Dudley North'. I think I'll keep it; it could yet become a collector's item."

2015-04-02,Bid to change Speaker election rules,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32061097,"A last-minute bid to change the way the Speaker of the House of Commons is elected is to be debated by MPs.Labour criticised the government motion, to be debated on the final day before the dissolution of Parliament, saying the Conservatives were ""trying to play politics with the speakership"".Under the proposals, a secret ballot would decide whether there should be a contested election for the post.MPs currently have to file through the division lobbies to cast their vote.This means it is clear who does or does not back the incumbent as Speaker.Labour's shadow leader of the Commons Angela Eagle raised the party's concerns in the House on Wednesday evening, questioning whether the motion was within parliamentary rules.Current Speaker John Bercow is - technically - one of them, but many Tory MPs have never liked him.They resent his personal style and some believe he is far from impartial in the way he conducts business in the Commons.Attempts by some to force a vote on his resumption as Speaker in 2010 came to nothing. There have been the occasional measured jibes at him from the prime minister. Other Tories reportedly went much further and formed a group whose members had all been reprimanded by him. But the Speaker is a reformer who believes passionately that the people who elect the members, and pay the bills, should come first.The last act of the coalition looks like being an attempt to unseat him. And they are very serious about it.One Tory MP fighting an important marginal seat had been cleared by his party to be away from Parliament but he is now staying for the vote, such is the importance of it.She told Deputy Speaker Lindsay Hoyle: ""It's just come to my attention that the government has tabled a motion for debate on the final day of this Parliament, with no notice whatsoever to myself as shadow leader of the House, proposing changes to the way in which the Speaker of this House is elected.""Procedural matters in this House, with no consultation with the opposition, no consultation with the chair of the committee itself, for debate in only one hour tomorrow.""Mr Hoyle said the motion had been ""rightly or wrongly"" agreed to on Tuesday, saying that ""business of the House is decided by the government, not by the chair.""A spokesman for Commons Leader William Hague said the motion had been tabled as a free hour had opened up in Thursday's business after the House of Lords approved the Modern Slavery Bill.The proposed change would apply when a Speaker wishes to continue in the post after a general election.Under the current rules, if the Speaker's re-appointment is objected to, a division is held, with MPs choosing to back or oppose the Speaker in the division lobbies.The replacement of this method with a secret ballot was suggested in 2010 by a committee of MPs, which said the public method ""can be seen as a deterrent to the House expressing its views honestly"".MPs will now debate whether this change should be made."

2015-04-02,MPs warn on growth of UK jihadists,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32059813,"Not enough is being done to prevent people leaving the UK to join Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, a group of MPs has warned.Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said Britain must win their ""hearts and minds"".The committee's report comes as the BBC launches a database tracking British jihadists in Syria and Iraq. It shows that many people left in clusters from certain UK areas - often due to friendships and peer groups. The MPs' report argued that preventative work with communities, families and international partners was ""vital"" and needs to be a top priority for the Home Office.  ""The number of cases being brought to public attention should ring alarm bells,"" said Labour MP Mr Vaz.  ""This must be a relentless battle for hearts and minds, and without a strong counter-narrative we are in danger of failing to prevent even more departures. We are at the edge of a cliff."" The BBC has been tracking the stories of the men, women, boys and girls who have gone to Syria and Iraq to understand why they go, where they go from and what happens to them. By analysing around 160 profiles, it reveals the way in which people have travelled in clusters - a group of three young friends from Coventry, another group from Portsmouth, drawn out by one person they knew, others in Cardiff linked to people involved in an extremist organisation. Social media might play a part but face-to-face contact appears just as, if not more, important, according to the database.It includes the stories of: The BBC research emphasises the extent to which real-world contacts, rather than just online connections, are often a key driver of radicalisation and intent to travel to Iraq and Syria. Some of the experts who appeared before the Home Affairs Committee also argued the internet was a secondary influence. They said that universities and prisons were among the two most significant places where radicalisation occurred. A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police, which was not aware of the report, said it would have ""welcomed the opportunity"" to have given evidence to the committee and that it planned to look at the report in detail.The disappearance of schoolgirls Shamima Begum, Amira Abase, both 15, and Kadiza Sultana, 16, from east London in February, raised questions as to who could have done more to prevent their departure. After taking evidence from the police and the families of the girls among others, Mr Vaz said their case suffered from a ""lack of immediate action"". He added: ""Schools and the police must inform parents immediately, and work with them even if there is the smallest hint of radicalisation, or a close association with someone who is thought to have been radicalised.""However, the Met Police spokesman defended the speed of the police response to the schoolgirls' disappearance.  He said the committee's criticism was ""misleading"", pointing to the evidence given by both UK and Turkish authorities of ""rapid exchanges"" between the two.The committee's report said there needed to be an advice service which would be a less extreme step than calling the anti-terrorist hotline.The Association of Chief Police Officer's lead officer for the government's anti-terror strategy Prevent, Chief Constable Sir Peter Fahy, agreed that more needed to be done.However, he said the police ""do not have the capacity"" to routinely work with every school in the country.He added: ""The police service will play its part but the prime responsibility for dissuading young people from getting involved in extremist activity has to lie with parents, families and carers.""The committee also pointed to weaknesses in information sharing with airlines and other countries. It said greater care needed to be taken at airport check-in desks when people were travelling to destinations of concern - namely Syria, Somalia, Iraq and Nigeria, as well as neighbouring countries, such as Turkey. The report said police also needed to work faster to alert overseas partners and airlines when there were concerns over individuals.There were signs that some of the girls had followed extremist accounts on social media, the report said.The committee said that social media companies, such as Facebook and Twitter, should be prepared to suspend accounts when there is evidence they are being used to promote violent extremism.  The report also said it was disappointed the Home Office had not implemented a programme for individuals returning to Britain where there is evidence they had fought in Syria.Security officials estimate that some 600 Britons have left the country to join IS - and while around half may have returned, many are still out there - and some have died.  The BBC project includes detailed profiles of individuals which can be searched, based on hometown, age and gender, as well as those who have been convicted in the courts or who are believed to have been killed."

If not, the prince's private letters will either remain confidential, as the sender intended, or they'll be exposed to a large and inquisitive audience. His friends say he has a right and a duty to communicate with the government of the day. His critics accuse him of meddling and argue the way he operates should be transparent.One day, as things stand, he'll be king.As that day draws closer, the influence Prince Charles attempts to exert on ministers - and attempt he does - has greater relevance and significance.

That will be a clear pledge from us.""He accused Mr Cameron of making an ""out of the blue, panicky"" announcement on VAT that ""no one in Britain will believe"".Labour, which has already announced plans to increase the top rate of income tax and impose a new ""mansion tax"" on high value properties, insists its plans are fully costed and will not require additional tax hikes if it wins May's general election.Mr Miliband began his final head-to-head encounter with Mr Cameron before the election by joking that the PM had ""announced his retirement plans"" - a reference to a BBC interview in which the prime minister said he would not serve a third term if the Tories remained in power.Challenging Mr Cameron to give a ""straight answer to a straight question"", Mr Miliband pressed him on whether he would rule out a rise in VAT after the election, as Labour had done.In response, the prime minister immediately said ""yes"", prompting loud cheers in turn from the Conservative benches. He contrasted what he said was a ""clear promise"" with Labour's unwillingness to rule out a rise in National Insurance.""I answered a very simple question about VAT. I ruled out an increase... straight answer to him, straight question from me. I have ruled out VAT. Will he rule out national insurance contributions. Yes or no?"" Mr Cameron added: ""We all know this is Labour's job tax. This is their tax of choice. This is what they clobber working people, families and enterprises with.""But Mr Miliband responded by saying there was ""only one person who is going to raise taxes on working families and that is him"".He said nobody would believe Mr Cameron on VAT ""because of his extreme spending plans, because his numbers do not add up and because he promised it last time and broke his promise"".Mr Cameron, he added, had broken other promises made before the last election to reduce annual net migration below 100,000 and not to pursue a major structural re-organisation of the NHS, adding that it was ""time for a better plan and time for a Labour government"".But Mr Cameron suggested a future Labour government would result in the ""chaos of economic crisis"", with Ed Miliband being ""held hostage"" by the SNP.The packed session provided a last opportunity for the two men to rally their MPs and set out their arguments before the start of the election campaign next week.Speaking after the exchanges and the other parties' tax pledges, deputy prime minister Nick Clegg said the Lib Dems ""don't need to raise VAT, national insurance or headline rates of income tax or corporation tax either"".""There are other taxes and other tax loopholes that we can increase or close in order to balance the books,"" he said.

2015-04-02,Met police 'had files on MPs in 90s',https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32044580,"A former undercover police officer has told BBC News that Scotland Yard kept intelligence files on MPs during the 1990s. Ex-Special Branch officer Peter Francis says he saw files on 10 Labour MPs which he and others regularly updated. He says he personally gathered information on three MPs as part of his work infiltrating left-wing groups. The MPs named, and Labour, have called for a forthcoming public inquiry into undercover policing to be widened. Mr Francis operated undercover between 1993 and 1997 in the Met's now disbanded Special Demonstration Squad. He was told to embed himself in left-wing groups or causes that were deemed to pose a potential threat to security. He says that during this period he was told to gather intelligence on MPs and their activities if and when they featured in any of his operations. That information, he says, was added to a special pink file that was available for Special Branch officers to read. Between 1990 and 2001, he claims to have personally seen records relating to Diane Abbott, the late Tony Benn, Jeremy Corbyn, the late Bernie Grant, Peter Hain, Harriet Harman, Ken Livingstone, Joan Ruddock, Dennis Skinner and Jack Straw.Four of the group became ministers during Mr Francis's time in Special Branch - including Jack Straw who was home secretary after 1997. ""When I was deployed undercover in the Special Demonstration Squad, any MP that I came across, such as on demonstrations, I would report back on them,"" he said. Mr Francis says that the files not only contained the MPs' publicly-stated political views - but also intelligence on what was going on behind the scenes in the party or their group. He says some of the information would have been things said in private by the MP, depending on how close each undercover officer had been able to get. Mr Francis said that when he first saw the files he understood that each had probably been created before the individual was an MP because of their personal involvement in radical causes or protests.But he added: ""When they became MPs these files carried on. It [was] your duty as an SDS officer to report back any intelligence that you come across. ""I felt that it was OK to report back on MPs,"" he said. ""I used to give myself a pat on the back, thinking 'I have done a good job'. These MPs were spied on and they should know.""""I don't think the police force should be monitoring MPs, full stop. I don't think we have any right to do that at all. It may be justifiable to say that the Security Service should be doing it - but I certainly don't think the police should be doing it.""Scotland Yard has refused to comment on the substance of the claims, but a spokesman said it had not shied away from serious allegations about the SDS. It said that Operation Herne, the internal police investigation into what happened in the unit, remained an ongoing investigation.""Operation Herne maintains that without speaking to Peter Francis it is simply not possible to fully investigate allegations he makes,"" said a spokesman. ""Operation Herne remains very willing to engage with him.""Mr Francis said that he has refused to speak to Operation Herne because he fears being interviewed under caution as a suspect, rather than a whistleblower. Scotland Yard told the BBC that Operation Herne detectives would be prepared to speak to him as a witness. He has, however, spoken to Mark Ellison QC who reviewed allegations about the SDS for the Home Secretary Theresa May - prompting her to launch a statutory inquiry. He says he will appear before those hearings. Peter Hain, who was a leader of the anti-apartheid movement in the late 1960s and 70s and became an MP in 1991, said he now wants full answers from Scotland Yard. ""I was deeply disturbed to find that files were still being kept by the Special Branch while I and others were serving Members of Parliament,"" he said. ""That is constitutionally an outrage. It infringes the sovereignty of Parliament. ""I want to see the home secretary widen the scope of the inquiry into the SDS to look specifically at the surveillance of MPs and the fact that there were active files on us while we were serving Members of Parliament. ""This should never have happened and it should have been reported and properly authorised - and we don't know whether it was.""Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper echoed the call for the inquiry to be widened in light of what she described as ""extremely serious and disturbing allegations"".""While undercover policing remains a crucial tool in combating serious and organised crime it must not be abused,"" she said.""There have now been a series of serious allegations about undercover policing - ranging from the treatment of Stephen Lawrence's family to police having long-term inappropriate relationships. ""We called some time ago for much stronger oversight of undercover policing and it is also vital to get to the truth about what has happened."" Mrs May announced earlier this month that Lord Justice Pitchford would lead the inquiry into the SDS allegations - but the precise shape of that inquiry is not yet clear.A Home Office spokesman said the review by Mark Ellison QC had unearthed ""serious historical failings"". ""That is why the Home Secretary established a public inquiry to thoroughly investigate undercover policing and the operation of the Special Demonstration Squad. ""Lord Justice Pitchford will consult interested parties to the inquiry over the coming months on setting the terms of reference, with a view to publishing these at the end of July.""Undercover policing is an essential tactic in the fight against crime but to improve the public's confidence in undercover work we must ensure there is no repeat of these failings in the future."""
2015-04-02,NHS problems worst 'since 1990s',https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/health-32057948,"Services in the NHS in England are deteriorating in a way not seen since the early 1990s, according to a leading health think tank. The King's Fund review said waiting times for A&E, cancer care and routine operations had all started getting worse, while deficits were growing.It said such drops in performance had not been seen for 20 years.But the think tank acknowledged the NHS had done as well as could be expected, given the financial climate.Professor John Appleby, chief economist at the King's Fund, which specialises in health care policy, said: ""The next government will inherit a health service that has run out of money and is operating at the very edge of its limits. ""There is now a real risk that patient care will deteriorate as service and financial pressures become overwhelming.""He said in terms of how standards were slipping - not how low they had reached - the situation was the worst it had been since the ""early 1990s"".The report noted much of the deterioration has happened in the second-half of the Parliament with many measures of performance being maintained in the first few years.It said the next government had to address the funding situation, adding the extra £8bn a year NHS England says is needed by 2020, was the ""minimum"" that would be required.The report - a review of performance this Parliament - highlights a range of problems as well as achievements. These include:The report is the second part of the King's Fund pre-election review of the NHS this Parliament.Last month it warned the coalition government's reforms of the health service had been ""damaging and distracting"".The King's Fund report should make worrying reading. The reference to the 1990s conjures up images of - for the NHS at least - a bygone era. The think tank's point was not that waiting times had reached the level they were at then, rather that this is the first time in two decades of almost continuous improvement that there has been a sustained drop in performance.In many ways, that had to happen. Services cannot keep getting better for ever. Nonetheless, the findings are crystal clear: the NHS is at a critical juncture. But what is less easy to determine is to what extent the coalition's policies have contributed to the difficulties.The think tank has already provided a critical analysis of the government's reforms - and when pushed, acknowledged the health service may have been ""in better shape"" if they had not happened.But the more significant issue for the health of the health service this Parliament has been the squeeze on finances. Even though the budget has been increased, it has felt more like a cut to many because demands have risen so quickly.On this though, the King's Fund accepted that the government's hands were tied. Given the state of the economy, ministers did as much as they could have.Read more from NickRoyal College of Nursing general secretary Peter Carter said politicians needed to take note of the warnings made by the King's Fund.""Morale is low, and more and more staff are being made sick with stress because of the intolerable pressure they are under,"" he added. Katherine Murphy, of the Patients Association, said: ""The findings echo what we are hearing on a daily basis on our helpline. It is clear to the public that the future of the NHS is one of the most important issues facing the nation and it should be a central issue in the election campaign.""Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham said: ""Five years ago David Cameron stood on a promise to protect the NHS. This report provides authoritative proof that he has broken that promise.""But a Department of Health spokesman said: ""As the King's Fund says, the NHS has 'performed well in the face of huge challenges', but if we are to continue to invest in the NHS going forward it needs to be backed by a strong economy.""

""That would mean chaos for Britain, with weak Ed Miliband dancing to Alex Salmond's tune.""He said the ""only way to keep Britain together"" was to vote Conservative.Mr Salmond's latest comments come after Mr Miliband said the only people writing a future Labour Budget would be himself and shadow chancellor Ed Balls.Speaking in Clydebank on Monday, he added: ""It's not going to be Alex Salmond - not in a million years."""

Its chairman, Conservative MP Sir William Cash, said the BBC had ""very particular obligations"" to be impartial and to ""educate and inform"".He added:  ""We do not believe this is currently being achieved in the context of the BBC's EU coverage.""A BBC spokesman said the corporation provided extensive and impartial coverage of European and Parliamentary issues, and it would be a breach of the corporation's independence if a committee of MPs instructed the BBC on its coverage."
2015-04-02,Lobbyists must 'conform' with rules,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32047992,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe woman in charge of the government's new register of lobbyists has said she expects the industry to ""conform"" with the statutory system. Speaking ahead of the register's launch, Alison White conceded a lot of lobbyists would not be listed on it.But she said her job was to make sure the rules were implemented and she would do so with ""extreme verve and vigour.""But one critic of the register said it was ""fake"" and full of ""loopholes"".Lobbyists are companies or individuals paid to influence government decisions.The coalition promised to introduce a statutory register of lobbyists when it came to power in 2010, and legislation was passed last year, with ministers saying the move would help clean up politics.However, the new register will only cover consultant lobbyists and will not apply to lobbyists working ""in-house"" for companies or organisations.A person or company will only need to be registered if they are contacting a government minister or permanent secretary in a government department - leading to criticism it will not come close to reflecting the scale or nature of lobbying that goes on across Whitehall.But Ms White, who is independent of the government, said her task was to implement the law as it stood not to question the powers she had been given. ""We are having something that has never been in place before,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""This is a statutory register. The industry tells me it is a professional industry. I expect them to conform with the legislation. It is my job to make sure they do so.""Ms White, who was appointed as the registrar of consultant lobbyists in September, acknowledged the register would not indicate different ""levels of lobbying"".""The legislation was quite narrowly drafted to address a particular issue, which was that it was not always particularly clear, when ministers were being lobbied, who the client of the lobbyist was. That is what the register was set up to do,"" she said.She added: ""This will give anyone who wishes to access the register the opportunity to be able to see who is lobbying and being paid for it and who their clients are. That is the main information the register will contain.""If a lobbyist sets out to influence government policy in some way, they would have to be registered. If they are not registered, then they would not be conforming. They have to go on the register before they lobby.""Ms White said last month that the register would not have any entries on its launch day but she had received more than ""20 expressions of interest"" about joining and companies and individuals might be required to sign up retrospectively.Potential registrants will be able to log on and create an account to file an ""information return"".But Tamasin Cave, from the Alliance for Lobbying Transparency coalition, said ""hardly anyone"" in the industry would be covered by the provisions of the new law. ""You have a huge commercial lobbying industry, and very few of them will have to sign up,"" she told Today.""The second flaw is that it won't show the interaction between lobbyists and government, and that is what a register is for.""It is to show the activity - who is discussing what with whom, but this shows nothing of this interaction. It is a fake register."""
2015-04-02,Car smoking ban MSP welcomes backing,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-south-scotland-32055226,"The Liberal Democrat MSP behind a bill to ban smoking in cars when children are present has welcomed the support of the Scottish government.South of Scotland MSP Jim Hume launched the members' bill in December.The government said it was ""very supportive"" of the principles of the bill, but changes could be needed to make it ""workable"".Motorists could potentially be fined £100 for breaching the rule if it becomes law.Mr Hume lodged draft proposals for a bill last May calling for a ban in Scotland on smoking in private vehicles when children under 18 were present.He said he was ""over the moon"" at the news the Scottish government would endorse the Smoking Prohibition (Children in Motor Vehicles) (Scotland) Bill.He said: ""With cross-party support and the support of many third sector organisations, there is every chance that this could be in place in the next year.""Eighty-four per cent of the 160 responses to my consultation were positive and people from across Scotland have expressed their support for the move.""The bill is about guaranteeing that children in Scotland can have the freedom to go on and lead healthy lives if they choose to.""I look forward to working with MSPs from all parties as the bill progresses.""Public Health Minister Maureen Watt said the Scottish government had considered including the measure in its Public Health Bill, but instead decided to support Mr Hume's proposals.She said: ""As with any bill, as it goes through the scrutiny process, there may be amendments and improvements to strengthen the legislation and ensure it is fit for purpose. ""But we believe that the underpinning principles are strong, and that is why I am pleased to support it.""Scottish Labour and a wide range of health organisations have backed his proposals.But the Scottish Conservatives have reservations about how the bill would work in practice.The party's health spokesman Jackson Carlaw said: ""While Scottish Conservatives support any moves which would protect young people from hazardous second hand smoke we have concerns as to how this would be enforced.""It would be a better use of resources to conduct a public awareness campaign similar to that which is being proposed by the government in Wales.""We will be watching this campaign in order to ascertain what lessons may be learned and what approaches may be adopted in Scotland.""Anti-smoking campaigners welcomed the Scottish government's backing for Mr Hume's bill.ASH Scotland's chief executive Sheila Duffy said: ""It is another public health initiative that can help Scotland move forward with its ambition to achieve a tobacco-free generation in 20 years' time.""It is popular with the public and will bring Scotland into line with upcoming legislation in England and Wales.""We believe it can be effectively enforced and that having the legislation focus on cars with children bypasses concerns over interference in people's private lives.""Jim Hume must be congratulated for taking the initiative on this proposal and for all the hard work he and his team have done to bring this important measure forward.""But Simon Clark, director of the smokers' group Forest, said the bill was ""legislation for legislation's sake"".He said: ""Smoking in cars carrying children is inconsiderate. The overwhelming majority of smokers know that and don't do it.""The very small number that do will carry on regardless because the law will be difficult, if not impossible, to enforce.""Education has to be better than legislation but the government prefers gesture politics and the big stick."""
2015-04-02,Candidate quits over UKIP MEP remark,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32038485,"A UKIP election candidate has quit the party over comments made by the party's only Scottish MEP about a Scottish government minister.Tim Wilson has decided not to stand in South Northamptonshire after David Coburn MEP compared Humza Yousaf to convicted terrorist Abu Hamza.Mr Coburn has apologised for the remarks, saying it was a ""joke"".A spokesman for UKIP said Mr Wilson had failed to emphasise local issues in his general election campaign.UKIP leader Nigel Farage said Mr Coburn's remarks were a ""joke in poor taste"" but he would not be taking any action against him.But Mr Wilson said he was disillusioned with the party over the ""racist jibes"" and has decided to stand down.He told BBC Scotland he was appalled by Mr Coburn's comments about Mr Yousaf and frustrated by the inaction of the party's leadership on the issue.  He said David Coburn had produced ""what I can only describe as an Islamaphobic insult, and that's simply not acceptable"".  Mr Wilson added: ""Of course he went on and apologised.  I think, frankly, that if you are in a position of power you have to be able to control what ideas emerge from your head and how they get to your mouth and, in fact, you shouldn't have those ideas in the first place.  ""But the real issue is that when Mr Farage was asked what he thought about this he dismissed this as a joke.  ""I don't think this is a joke. I think this is something very serious.  It may not be that this man intended to cause offence but we aren't interested in what his intentions are.  We are interested in the effect what he says has on other people and the effect is catastrophic, it's appalling and I've resigned.""In his resignation letter, Mr Wilson said he had been ""systematically gagged by the party whip"" and forbidden to speak about Islam favourably. A spokesman for UKIP said Mr Wilson had failed to put more emphasis on local issues in his campaign.He said: ""Whilst we had initially been optimistic about Tim Wilson's abilities as a candidate, it became obvious in recent weeks that he was out of his depth in representing our party in the way we would expect. ""Mr Wilson had clearly misunderstood the expectations that UKIP place on all of its candidates. Principal amongst those is focusing on issues that are relevant to local voters. UKIP put huge emphasis on local issues and Mr Wilson was unwilling to follow UKIP guidelines in this respect.""Last week MSPs at the Scottish Parliament unanimously condemned the remarks made by Mr Coburn during a newspaper interview.MSPs were debating a motion celebrating Scotland's diverse communities.The president of the European Parliament, Martin Schulz, condemned the remarks, saying they were ""not worthy of any elected member"". But a spokesman for the president said he could not act on remarks made outside parliament.The move comes just days after another candidate, Jonathan Stanley, quit in protest at the ""racist filth"" in UKIP. Mr Stanley, who was due to stand in the Cumbrian seat of Westmorland and Lonsdale, was the party's former head of policy in Scotland."

2015-04-02,Manifesto watch,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-29642613,"Political parties are putting together their manifestos for May's general election. Here's a guide to where they currently stand on the issues voters say they care about most (according to pollsters IPSOS Mori).ImmigrationConservatives:  David Cameron wants to make migrants wait four years before they can claim certain benefits, such as tax credits, Universal Credit, or get access to social housing. He wants to stop migrants from claiming child benefit for dependents living outside the UK, and remove those that have failed to find work after six months. Mr Cameron has promised to put reform of EU free movement rules at the heart of his renegotiation of Britain's relationship with the EU. He has ruled out a temporary cap on migrant numbers or an ""emergency brake"" on EU freedom of movement rules - ideas both mooted in recent months, saying this would be less ""effective"" than reducing the incentives for people to come to the UK. The party has a continuing goal to bring net immigration down to below 100,000 people a year (it currently stands at 243,000).Labour: ""Stronger"" border controls to tackle illegal immigration with ""proper"" entry and exit checks. ""Smarter"" targets to reduce low-skilled migration but ensure university students and high-skilled workers are not deterred. Employment agencies who only recruit abroad will be outlawed while the fines for employing illegal immigrants will be increased.Lib Dems: Reintroduce exit checks at borders, so the government can identify people who are overstaying their visa. Will require all new claimants for Jobseekers Allowance to have their English language skills assessed, with JSA then being conditional on attending language courses for those whose English is poor. Ensure that EU migrants have to ""earn"" their entitlement to benefits.SNP: Allow the devolved government to have control over immigration to Scotland, and introduce a Canadian-style earned citizenship system to attract highly-skilled immigrants.Plaid Cymru: Oppose a points-based system. Support the right of asylum seekers to work in Wales while they wait for status decisions to be made. Lobby the Westminster government to ensure that they shut ""detention"" centres.UKIP: Introduce an Australian-style points policy, used to select migrants with the skills and attributes needed to work in the country - covering people from inside and outside the EU. Bring net immigration down to 50,000 people a year. Priority lanes for UK passport holders. Increase UK border staff by 2,500. Tougher English language tests for migrants seeking permanent residence. Opt out of the Dublin treaty to allow the UK to return asylum seekers to other EU countries without considering their claim. Anyone who currently has the legal right to live, work, or study in the UK would not face deportation in the event of the country's withdrawal from the EU.Greens:  Progressively reduce UK immigration controls. Migrants illegally in the UK for over five years will be allowed to remain unless they pose a serious danger to public safety. More legal rights for asylum seekers.Taxes and the economyConservatives: Eradicate the deficit by 2018 and secure an overall budget surplus by 2019-20. Achieve this by spending cuts, not tax rises, while raising NHS spending. An income tax cut for 30 million people by 2020. Tax would start to kick in at £12,500 a year, instead of £10,500. This will cost £5.6bn. The higher tax rate, 40%, would start at £50,000 instead of £41,900, again by 2020, at a cost of £1.6bn. This will be paid for through £25bn in additional spending cuts and economic growth. No increases in VAT.Labour: Get the current budget into surplus and the national debt falling ""as soon as possible in the next parliament"". No additional borrowing for new spending. Reintroduce the 50p top rate of income tax for earnings over £150,000.  Cut income tax for 24 million people by bringing back the 10p rate, paid for by scrapping the Married Couples' Tax Allowance. Bring in a ""mansion tax"" on properties worth over £2m, to raise £1.2bn. A tax on bankers' bonuses. A 5% pay cut for every government minister. Push for UK overseas territories to be put on an international blacklist if they refuse to co-operate with a drive against tax avoidance. No increases in VAT or National Insurance contributions.Lib Dems: Raise the personal allowance - the point at which you start paying income tax - to £11,000 in April 2016 and then to £12,500 by 2020. ""Strict new fiscal rules"" to ensure the deficit has gone by April 2018, with the wealthy contributing the most. The Lib Dems invented the ""mansion tax"" but in contrast to Labour have set out how it would operate - along similar lines to council tax bands. There are also Lib Dem plans to increase capital gains tax - paid on profits from second homes or shares - from 28% to 35%. Impose an additional 8% rate of corporation tax on UK banks to raise an extra £1bn a year to help pay off the deficit.SNP: Oppose UK plans in the Infrastructure Bill which will allow oil and gas drilling and hydraulic fracturing beneath people's homes without consent. Invest in offshore wind farming. Support an international bank tax and limits to industry bonuses.Plaid Cymru: Build a Green Skills Construction College, specialising in green energy. Establish a publicly-owned energy company. Establish a publicly-owned Bank of Wales business investment bank. Enforce a living wage. Give devolved nations an equal say in institutions that affect everyone's lives, such as the Bank of England.UKIP: Increase the personal allowance to the level of full-time minimum wage earnings, about £13,500, by 2020. Abolish inheritance tax. Introduce a 35% income tax rate between £42,285 and £55,000, at which point the 40% rate becomes payable. Set up a Treasury Commission to design a turnover tax on large businesses. Cut foreign aid budget by £9bn a year. Scrap HS2. Save £8bn a year in membership fees by leaving the EU.  Lower the VAT rate charged on restorations to listed buildings.Greens: People earning more than £100,000 a year would pay 50% income tax. Wealth tax of 1% to 2% on people worth £3m or more. Renationalise the railways and energy companies. Scrap HS2. Allow councils to impose extra business rates on out-of-town supermarkets to fund small local businesses. Crackdown on tax avoidance by multinationals. Allow ""the current dependence on economic growth to cease, and allow zero or negative growth to be feasible without individual hardship"". Commit Britain to a ""zero carbon"" future. Cut rail and bus fares by an average of 10%. Enforce a cap on bankers' bonuses.The NHSConservatives:  Chancellor George Osborne says he will put an extra £2bn into frontline health services across the UK, which he described as a ""down payment"" on a plan drawn up by NHS bosses calling for an extra £8bn a year above inflation by 2020. In England, everyone would be able to see a GP seven days a week by 2020. Recruit 5,000 more doctors.Labour:  Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said Labour would commit an extra £2.5bn a year above Mr Osborne's plan. The money will come from three sources - a new ""mansion"" tax, clamping down on tax avoidance by big corporations and a new tax on tobacco companies. Patients in England would get a GP appointment within 48 hours and would not have to wait longer than a week for cancer tests and results. Scrap the Health and Social Care Act and end ""creeping privatisation"" of the NHS.  Integrate health and social care services into a system of ""whole-person care"". Give greater priority to mental health services. Replace the Cancer Drugs Fund in England when it runs out in 2016 with a £330m fund to improve access to innovative cancer drugs, surgery and radiotherapy. Recruit 5,000 more healthcare workers to help patients stay in their homes and introduce new safety checks to identify people at risk of hospitalisation. Prioritise child mental health by increasing the proportion of the mental health budget spent on children.Lib Dems: An extra £1bn for the NHS every year, to be funded by - amongst other things - making higher earners pay more tax on their shares. Half of this will go towards mental health. Ensure that spending on the NHS rises in line with growth in the economy. People who need therapy for conditions such as depression will be guaranteed treatment within 18 weeks. For young patients experiencing psychosis for the first time treatment will be provided within two weeks of being referred by a GP. This is all going to happen from April, with more mental health targets to follow if the Lib Dems return to government. Wants a cross-party review of the future of NHS funding.SNP: Reduce the number of senior managers in the NHS by 25% over the next parliament. Streamline the work of health boards. Real terms increases in year-on-year NHS spending.Plaid Cymru: Recruit 1,000 extra doctors to the Welsh NHS over two terms of a Plaid government. Offer financial incentives for recruiting doctors to areas and specialisms where there are, or are predicted to be, shortages. Encourage innovation and attract more research funding, in part by increasing research and development funding as government finance allows. Improve training for postgraduate doctors and stop them being used to ""plug gaps"" in staff rotas. More recruitment from within the EU to fill vacancies and using international doctors to staff the NHS while a new generation of Welsh doctors are trained.UKIP: An extra £3bn per year in NHS funding paid for by quitting the EU and through ""middle management"" cuts. Keep NHS free at the point of delivery. Stop any further use of PFI, and encourage local authorities to buy out their PFI contracts early where it is affordable to do so. Ensure all visitors and migrants who have been here for fewer than five years have NHS-approved medical insurance as a condition of entry to UK, with £200m of the £2bn saved to be spent on ending hospital parking charges in England. Bring back state-enrolled nurses and return powers to matrons. Monitor and Care Quality Commission to be replaced with elected county health boards. Stop spending £90m a year on gastric band and breast enhancement operations.Greens: Funding to be diverted away from centralised facilities towards community healthcare, illness prevention and health promotion.  Stop privatisation. Abolish prescription charges. Dedicated NHS Tax to go direct to the health service. Ban proactive recruitment of non-British NHS staff from overseas. A complete ban on the promotion of tobacco and alcohol products, including sponsorship.Security, defence and foreign affairsConservatives: Hold a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU by 2017, after negotiating the return of some powers from Brussels. Protect foreign aid budget. Replace Trident.Labour:  Push for reform of European Union and prevent Britain from ""sleepwalking"" towards exit. Commit in law to holding a Strategic Defence and Security Review every 5 years. Outlaw discrimination and abuse of Armed Forces personnel.Lib Dems: Campaign to reduce the number of Trident nuclear submarines. Push for greater European Union efficiency. SNP: Oppose nuclear weapons and push for removal of Trident submarines from Scotland. In 2010, proposed a Scottish Centre for Reconciliation and Conflict Resolution, to promote peaceful alternatives to armed conflict. Maintain 0.7% commitment to foreign aid. Enhanced role for Scotland within the UK in Europe, particularly in fisheries policy.Plaid Cymru: Honour commitment of 0.7% of budget used for foreign aid. Campaign for cancellation of developing countries' debts. Support the Fair Trade movement. Support the 'Tobin' or 'Robin hood' tax as a means of encouraging more responsibility and stability in the global markets. Reform the IMF and World Bank in order to improve regulation and accountability. Continue membership of the EU, but campaign for democratic reform. Support minority nations and minority language speakers around the world. Pass a Military Wellbeing Act to promote and safeguard the physical and mental health and wellbeing of military personnel.UKIP:  Leave the European Union. Remove the passports of any person who has gone to fight for a terrorist organisation and deport anyone who has committed a terrorist act. Cut foreign aid budget by £9bn. Create a Veterans Department to look after the interests of ex-service men and women.Greens: Referendum on Britain's EU membership. Want reform of EU to hand powers back to local communities. Boost overseas aid to 1% of GDP within 10 years. Scrap Britain's nuclear weapons. Take the UK out of NATO unilaterally. End the so-called ""special relationship"" between the UK and the US.  Stop EU-US free trade deal TTIP. JobsConservatives: Create three million apprenticeships to be paid for by benefit cuts.Labour: Guarantee a job for under 25s unemployed for over a year and adults unemployed for more than two years. As many young people to go on an apprenticeship as currently go to university by 2025. Create a million new high technology, green jobs by 2025. Ban ""exploitative"" zero hour contracts.Lib Dems: An extra £1 an hour for the lowest paid apprentices. Campaign to create a million more jobs.SNP: Introduce gender quotas on public boards. Living wage ""a central priority"" in all Scottish government contracts. Continue the 'small business bonus'.Plaid Cymru: Provide rates relief for small businesses. Increase the number and value of contracts from Welsh public bodies that go to firms within Wales.UKIP: Allow firms to offer jobs to British workers first ""without the fear of being sued for discrimination"".Greens: A national energy conservation scheme to create thousands of new jobs. The party wants to create ""sustainable jobs"" and promotes more local production of food and goods.Education Conservatives: Protect England's schools budget - from reception entry at age four or five to the end of GCSEs at 16 - in cash terms although funding per pupil will not keep pace with inflation. Pre-school and post 16 education not ring fenced. Convert up to 3,500 more schools judged by Ofsted to ""require improvement"" into academies. ""War on illiteracy and innumeracy"". State primary schools in England that repeatedly failed to have a proportion of year-six pupil pass times tables and writing tests be forced to become academies, or have sponsorship replaced if already an academy. Opposed to giving votes to 16 and 17-year-olds for UK-wide general elections and local elections in England.Labour:  Increase the overall education budget in England, including schools, nurseries, Sure Start and provision for 16-to 18-year-olds, by at least the rate of inflation, although per-pupil funding is not specifically protected, meaning some of the increase will be eaten up by rising pupil numbers. Parents of primary school children would be guaranteed childcare from 8am to 6pm. The amount of free childcare for three and four year olds would be increased from 15 to 25 hours a week. Compulsory sex and relationship education in all schools. Refuse to grant business rate relief to independent schools unless they can show a ""meaningful impact"" on state schools through a new School Partnership Standard, for example by lending teaching staff or assisting in university admissions procedures. Committed to extending the franchise to 16 and 17-year-olds in elections across the UK. Double the number of Sure Start childcare places to more than 118,000. Tighten up the rules on primary school class sizes to ensure they do not have more than 30 pupils.Lib Dems: Protect the education budget from cuts. Guarantee qualified teachers and a core curriculum set by independent experts, as well as compulsory sex education, in all state schools including academies and free schools. More money for disadvantaged school children and free childcare for all two year olds. A two-thirds discount on all local bus fares for young people aged 16-21. Supports lowering the voting age to 16 in all UK elections.SNP: Guaranteed free 30 hours of childcare a week for three and four-year-olds in Scotland, up from 16 hours. Maintain lack of tuition fees at Scottish universities, and offer financial support in grants and loans to students. Continue to build and refurbish schools. Lower voting age to 16 in all UK elections.Plaid Cymru: Introduce a compulsory modern foreign language GCSE in secondary schools and the teaching of modern foreign languages in primary schools. Look at ways to strengthen the teaching of Welsh history and culture. Oppose foundation schools, academies and free schools. Look at moving from a per-pupil funding mechanism to a funding model based on the catchment area. Will not support any further increases in tuition fees for higher education students, and will seek the abolition of tuition fees as and when public finances allow. Supports lowering the voting age to 16 for elections to the Welsh Assembly and the UK Parliament.UKIP: More grammar schools. Scrap sex education for children aged under seven. Scrap tuition fees for students from poorer backgrounds who take degree courses in the sciences, technology, maths or engineering. Greater emphasis on vocational education with new Apprenticeship Qualification Option. School governing boards must be made up of at least 30% parents of children at the school. Allow universities to charge same amount for EU students as non-EU students.Greens: End performance related pay for teachers. Replace Ofsted with an independent National Council for Educational Excellence. Bring Free Schools and Academies into local authority control.

Give councils the power to borrow money to build houses or buy them on the open market. Introduce a rent cap to prevent exploitation by private landlords. Set up a living rent commission, to work out how to bring rents back in line with incomes. Home owners unable to meet mortgage payments or under threat of repossession would get right to transfer ownership to the council, at less than market value, and pay rent as council tenants.

Stop paying child benefit for children who don't live in Britain. Scrap what UKIP calls the ""detested bedroom tax"". Boost ""credit unions"".Greens: The party backs a Citizen's Income, a fixed amount of £72 income a week to be paid to every individual, whether they are in work or not, to be funded by higher taxes on the better off and green levies.  But in the short-term it would increase the minimum wage to £10 by 2020. Ban zero hours contracts. Axe the ""bedroom tax"".

2015-04-02,Elephant trap?,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32047998,"The campaign has not even got under way, yet in the space of a couple of hours we have now been treated to not only one election pledge, but to two. The prime minister ruled out raising VAT if re-elected - while Labour said National Insurance contributions wouldn't go up.Usually politicians fudge the question of tax rises.  When he was leader of the opposition David Cameron himself said ""we have no need to raise taxes"" - before hiking up VAT after polling day.Famously, John Major said he had ""no plans"" to put up the sales tax -  before his chancellor did just that.And when he appeared in front of the cross-party Treasury committee of MPs on Tuesday, the current chancellor seemed to be continuing that tradition.  Under repeated questioning, George Osborne said: ""The policies we have do not involve a VAT rise.""That formulation appeared to give him not so much wriggle room, but an entire wriggle mansion.Labour assumed their campaign warning of further VAT rises to come under the Tories was very much on the money.But George Osborne's allies are suggesting privately that he had, in fact, been walking Ed Miliband to the edge of an elephant trap, then beckoning the prime minister to push the opposition leader in.Ed Miliband's strategists fully expected Mr Cameron to repeat the chancellor's obfuscation on tax at the final Prime Minister's Questions of this Parliament. They would then have expanded on the theme, inviting the prime minister to answer other difficult questions - then say he wasn't being straight with the British people for avoiding them.But the Labour leader was completely wrong-footed when first the prime minister said he would rule out a VAT rise and then counter-punched, inquiring if Labour would now rule out an increase in National Insurance contributions.Ed Miliband dodged the question and what could have been downbeat Conservative benches, uneasy over the prime minister's announcement this week of his retirement plans, were given something to cheer.The reason Ed Miliband didn't respond is because he was holding the National Insurance pledge back for Labour's manifesto.But that soon became unsustainable - so the other Ed, the shadow chancellor Ed Balls, had to undertake a hasty round of the TV studios to do just that.When I spoke to him mid-tour, he put on a brave face. His view was that George Osborne, having raised VAT from 17.5% to 20%, wanted to give the issue a low profile - whereas the prime minister had now made the mistake of putting it centre stage. And he believed David Cameron's promise would be judged against his past VAT-raising performance.He defended Ed Miliband's reluctance to talk about National Insurance as he felt it would have been ""inappropriate"" to announce Labour tax policy at PMQs.So the prime minister - always a better tactician than strategist - can at least satisfy himself that he smoked Labour out on NI and disrupted at least one entry in their election campaign grid.But the exchange actually raised more questions than it answered.If the main parties are ruling out further potential sources of revenue, but still committing themselves to eradicating a £90bn black hole in the public finances, will they now be under more pressure during the election campaign to spell out in much greater detail exactly what they intend to cut?"
2015-04-02,Who's next?,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32031343,"David Cameron's declaration that he will not seek a third term in office if he retains power in May has immediately stoked interest in who might fill his shoes when he's gone. Here are the likely - and perhaps less obvious - possibilities.Claim? As chancellor of the exchequer he's the man in charge of the purse strings and master strategist - and reportedly the PM's favourite to succeed him, although he hasn't said as much. Mr Cameron's right-hand man has had an image makeover of late, with a new haircut and a diet to shed some pounds. And he has seemingly recovered from his ""omnishambles"" Budget in 2012, with his latest - and last Budget - of the parliament giving the Tories a lead in some polls. He's said to be well liked among Conservative cabinet ministers and backbench MPs, whose support is vital for any candidate wanting to take on the party leadership. He shas some work to do among grassroots Tory members, however, coming fifth in ConservativeHome's latest online poll of party members on future leaders.Latest odds: 10/1 (according to William Hill)What's he said? ""The prime minister leads a strong team but what you see from him is answering a direct question with a direct answer. I think that's really refreshing. He says he's going to serve that full five years so the real question facing the country now is do you want the strong leadership of David Cameron that's delivering zero inflation and record jobs or do you want the chaos and incompetence of Ed Miliband.""Claim? The longest-serving home secretary in 50 years, she is only the second Conservative woman to secure one of the top four jobs in government. In her role, she has talked tough on immigration and crime and taken on the Police Federation. And she is popular with Tory activists, consistently occupying either first or second place in ConservativeHome's online polls on future party leaders. There have long been claims of Mrs May positioning herself for the top job, with reported tensions between her and the prime minister. Critics say she lacks charisma and micro-manages - while some cannot forget her coining the now infamous ""nasty party"" phrase at a Tory conference in 2002, but supporters say she is a formidable operator, and have dubbed her Britain's Angela Merkel. Latest odds: 9/2What's she said? ""My view is very simple, David Cameron is a first class leader of the party and a first class prime minister and I hope he is going to be doing that for a very long time."" (Desert Island discs, 23 November 2014)Claim? The blonde bombshell and mayor of London who can seemingly reach voters that others in the party cannot. Casting aside a rather chequered past he steered the capital through the 2012 Olympics, launched the successful and popular ""Boris bikes"" and got rid of London's ""bendy buses"" in favour of the new Routemaster double deckers. Mr Johnson hopes to revive his Westminster parliamentary career at the general election. He has been tipped by many to take the helm of the Conservative Party, and has not discouraged the idea. Like Theresa May, he is also a favourite among the grassroots of the party, pipping her to the top spot in ConservativeHome's latest poll of party members on future leaders. (he's ahead by 2 points). Critics say the gaffe-prone politician is not the right man for the job, but his supporters point to his wide-spread appeal.Latest odds: 9/4What's he said? ""I think what David Cameron is saying is banal and obvious. There has already been a leader of the Conservative Party for ten years and he's done an outstanding job. What he's saying now is that he wants to serve through to 2020 and that is frankly what we need him to do... five more years is what this country needs. I'm not entirely certain I see what the story is. He was asked a straight question, are you going to serve a third term like Mrs Thatcher or Tony Blair and he said no, because he thinks that ten years on top of British politics is an incredibly long time.""Claim? A self-made millionaire and devotee of Margaret Thatcher, he is regarded as one of the Conservatives' fastest-rising stars. The Treasury minister-turned-culture secretary became the first of the 2010 intake of MPs to reach cabinet level, and the first Asian male Conservative cabinet minister. He's currently polling well among the Conservative grassroots, who voted him third most preferable leader in ConservativeHome's latest online future leader poll. David Cameron recently said he wants to see a British Asian prime minister in his lifetime.Latest odds: 12/1Claim? Currently holding one of the four great offices of state - foreign secretary - Mr Hammond's name has often cropped up whenever talk of leadership contenders has emerged. He has built up an impressive CV in government since the Conservatives came to power in 2010, being first awarded the job of transport secretary before his promotion to defence secretary where he stayed for three years. He's regarded by many commentators as being a potential candidate for the Tory right. He seems to have work to do among party activists, scoring only 4% in ConservativeHome's future leader poll.Latest odds: 12/1"
2015-04-02,Cereal number,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-magazine-monitor-31962592,"David Cameron has declared he won't seek a third term as prime minister, citing an advertising slogan for Shredded Wheat used in the UK more than 30 years ago. What's its enduring power, asks Justin Parkinson.The hotel kitchen staff are in disbelief. Someone in room 147 has ordered three Shredded Wheat. The maid transports them upstairs to find England cricketer Ian Botham waiting at a table, dressed in full whites.The maid leaves. Botham hides one of the Shredded Wheat under a napkin and winks to camera. Cue music, as the slogan ""Shredded Wheat. Bet you can't eat three"" appears.This advert and others featuring football manager Brian Clough and the actor Richard Kiel, who played Jaws in James Bond films, have not run for some time. Nestle, which owns the brand, says the last probably aired in 1984.But their message seems to have waned little. Telling the BBC he would only serve a limited time in Downing Street, David Cameron said: ""Terms are like Shredded Wheat - two are wonderful but three might just be too many.""The prime minister's reprise was unlikely to be accidental, says Thayne Forbes, joint managing director of the brand-valuation company Intangible Business. ""Everybody would empathise with the view that three Shredded Wheat would probably be too much,"" he says. ""The slogan suggests people shouldn't overdo it. It sounds modest and reasoned.""As marketing goes, it might seem counter-intuitive, as it discourages excessive consumption. But it also sounds honest and unexploitative.Other advertising slogans and themes are in wide use in public and political discourse. Examples include Marmite being a by-word for divisiveness - a ""Marmite person"" is either loved or hated. Cameron has twice referred to Ronseal - the woodcare product that does ""exactly what it says on the tin"". But Shredded Wheat, its best-known slogan having lain dormant for so long, appears to be used less often. The cereal, created in the US in the 1890s, has long been sold as good for the evolving British lifestyle. A newspaper advert in 1902 described it as ""a relief from the monotony of everlasting porridge"", while, by 1943, it was ""an ideal food for all war workers"". The 1980s saw an emphasis on ""simple, honest goodness"", while, in the 2000s, its long heritage and reliability was promoted.""It's a good association for Cameron,"" says Forbes. ""He must have been brought up on it, like lots of other people. It will be great marketing for Shredded Wheat to have the slogan used after so many years, too.""Subscribe to the BBC News Magazine's email newsletter to get articles sent to your inbox"
2015-04-02,Are you 'cosmopolitan'?,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32021853,"The rise of UKIP heralds the emergence of a new divide in British politics, with cosmopolitan voters on one side and non-cosmopolitan ones on the other, argues Jeremy Cliffe.We hear a lot about UKIP these days. The party stole the show at the local and European elections last year, then again in the autumn when it lured two Conservative MPs to defect.  In the past weeks alone there have been three much-discussed television programmes about the party: ""Meet the Ukippers"", ""Farage Fans and UKIP Lovers"" and ""100 Days of UKIP"". At the upcoming general election the party will probably increase its share of seats in Westminster - and will certainly affect the results in dozens of other constituencies by taking votes from the other parties. But ask some of those academics who have been watching UKIP's rise, and they will tell you that it is just one part of a bigger story. We are all used to the left-right divide in politics: a spectrum of different views on how much the government should tax, spend, regulate and otherwise intervene in the economy. But according to Dr Rob Ford of Manchester University, UKIP exists on a different axis, one to do with cultural rather than economic matters. This new political scale is ever more prominent in British political life.Radio 4's Analysis programmeOn the one end of it is what you might call a ""cosmopolitan"" philosophy: a relaxed, liberal attitude to issues concerning national identity (like immigration) and to questions of morality and lifestyle (like gay marriage). On the other end is a ""non-cosmopolitan"" outlook: more nationalist, socially conservative and less comfortable with social change, or in other words the ideological stance often associated with typical UKIP voters. This divide cuts across the left-right scale: there are cosmopolitan and non-cosmopolitan voters in both the Conservative and the Labour camps, which is why UKIP takes support from both.Lots of things are making this cosmopolitanism divide more important. One is that the old class-based, ideological conflict between left and right has declined. Dr James Tilley of Oxford University argues that politicians are partly to blame. The economic philosophies of the Conservative and Labour parties are so similar, he argues, that other, cultural issues are becoming more important. Another factor is the growing gap between the generations: the difference in outlook between the cosmopolitan young and less cosmopolitan, older voters is greater than it was in the past (partly due to the recent rise in levels of university education, which tend to correlate with liberal views). This trend presents the established parties with some difficult questions. As Dr Ford puts it, they ""have to try and deal with this rising value divide, particularly now that UKIP has mobilised it into the political debate."" ""They have to make a move,"" he adds, ""but any move that they make risks making their position worse with one or the other of these groups of voters."" Sound too cosmopolitan, and the parties risk losing supporters to UKIP. Try to ""out-UKIP UKIP"", and they could alienate their younger, more socially liberal supporters. So both are doing the political splits, trying to reconcile the cosmopolitans within their ranks with the non-cosmopolitans. Witness the tortuous attempts by Ed Miliband to sound tough on immigration without sounding too tough. Witness, too, the recent struggles of David Cameron to persuade social conservatives in his party that gay marriage can be an innately conservative institution. In the long-term, this divide will become less problematic. That is because over the years the country will tilt towards the cosmopolitan end of this new spectrum. So says Penny Young of NatCen, the research organisation that conducts the extensive British Social Attitudes survey. Various demographic factors explain this trend. The country as a whole is becoming more accepting of same-sex relationships. Younger voters are more relaxed about things like immigration and national identity than were previous generations when they were young, suggesting that the overall population will tilt in an internationalist direction over time. And ever more parts of the country are acquiring the ethnic and social diversity once confined to the inner cities, a trend that generally makes people more comfortable with immigration. According to Dr Ford the question is therefore: how should the main political parties navigate this period of transition? It would be wrong to simply abandon the swathes of voters at the less cosmopolitan end of the scale; voters who are usually older and more isolated than the average member of the population.Yet the politicians do need to adapt to the changing attitudes of British society and be honest with voters rather than pandering to views that, deep down, they do not share. This quandary may not decide the upcoming general election, but in the established parties savvy strategists with an eye to elections in 2020 and beyond are grappling with it nonetheless. That is a wise move."
2015-04-02,Dudley debate,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32015334,"I met Afzal Amin for the first time on Friday, but I already knew who he was. In Dudley North, the seat he was selected by the Conservatives to fight in the general election, Mr Amin had become hard to avoid. When I first looked at the local newspaper online, the pages were surrounded by ""Amin"" logos in the preferred Tory shade of blue.Not long after we met, he asked me to pose for a photo, snapped by one of his campaign team, and doubtless rapidly tweeted out to followers of the would-be MP.Perhaps no surprise that the man running such a disciplined operation has served in the army and been to Sandhurst. That was very much the message he delivered on Friday, as he addressed school and college pupils at a hustings in Dudley which I'd been invited to chair.There was combative debate, too, not least with his Labour rival, the MP Ian Austin. Both men knew the Dudley contest was critical for their respective parties; Ian Austin held the seat by just over 600 votes in 2010. Just as David Cameron was denied a majority by failing to take seats like this one, so Ed Miliband is unlikely to be in No 10 if Labour loses Dudley North.He was self-confident and fluent. The only obvious mis-step came right at the end, when he interrupted Vicky Duckworth, the Green candidate for the neighbouring seat. She expressed the opinion that politics often seemed to be about men shouting at each other; Mr Amin complained she was engaging in gender bias.A few weeks ago, one Conservative MP who knows him well and respects his talents, said Afzal Amin had warned him of the risks of over-confidence. He thought he risked running before he could walk.Well, he stumbled badly this weekend. Whatever the purpose of his contacts with the English Defence League - and he strongly disputes claims that he wanted them to hold a protest that would then be called off, for which he could then take the credit - the exposure has damaged him and, potentially, the prospects of his party re-taking the seat.In February, the EDL staged a rally against plans for a new mosque in the town. As the Mail on Sunday story makes clear, Afzal Amin pleaded with them beforehand not to hold that demonstration; but it went ahead anyway. It's what happened subsequently which will feature in Tuesday's disciplinary hearing.Over the weekend, I put his defence to a very senior Conservative source - that this was an attempt to broker a compromise in order to bring together a divided community. The arch response: Dudley isn't Kandahar.Nor do I think from my visits to the town, where I'm going to be based for the general election, will people in Dudley appreciate being painted as somewhere riven by racial discord.True, Dudley was the scene of one of England's earliest race riots. But that was in 1962. Although the controversy over replacing the mosque - currently in a converted school and inadequate for the numbers who want to worship there - has been running for a decade, community relations are generally good. Even those who don't want a new mosque didn't want the EDL protestors - nor to be fair the anti-fascist counter-demonstrators who followed them.As for the Conservative Party, the view of the national leadership is that you don't collaborate with the EDL. Not least because the Tories are still struggling to bury some historic baggage in the Black Country: Enoch Powell was an MP in Wolverhampton when he delivered his Rivers of Blood speech about immigration in 1968.Four years before that, there was the notorious election in Smethwick which the Conservatives were accused of winning by wooing white voters with an offensive rhyme suggesting who'd they'd get as a neighbour if they voted Labour. Afzal Amin grew up in Smethwick so he should be aware of that history. He was, until his suspension on Saturday, one of about 17% of Conservative parliamentary candidates who are not white. The party is proud of that, but it's still struggling to translate that into votes.Afzal Amin may believe that he can persuade the party to lift the suspension when he meets party officials on Tuesday. I have my doubts. Even if they accept his defence, will the other parties be so charitable? The allegations would follow him on the campaign trail, and make planned visits by cabinet ministers next to impossible.On Friday, just before the hustings in Dudley began, Afzal Amin gave me his business card. It introduces him as 'prospective member of Parliament Dudley North'. I think I'll keep it; it could yet become a collector's item."

2015-04-03,Bid to change Speaker election rules,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32061097,"A last-minute bid to change the way the Speaker of the House of Commons is elected is to be debated by MPs.Labour criticised the government motion, to be debated on the final day before the dissolution of Parliament, saying the Conservatives were ""trying to play politics with the speakership"".Under the proposals, a secret ballot would decide whether there should be a contested election for the post.MPs currently have to file through the division lobbies to cast their vote.This means it is clear who does or does not back the incumbent as Speaker.Labour's shadow leader of the Commons Angela Eagle raised the party's concerns in the House on Wednesday evening, questioning whether the motion was within parliamentary rules.Current Speaker John Bercow is - technically - one of them, but many Tory MPs have never liked him.They resent his personal style and some believe he is far from impartial in the way he conducts business in the Commons.Attempts by some to force a vote on his resumption as Speaker in 2010 came to nothing. There have been the occasional measured jibes at him from the prime minister. Other Tories reportedly went much further and formed a group whose members had all been reprimanded by him. But the Speaker is a reformer who believes passionately that the people who elect the members, and pay the bills, should come first.The last act of the coalition looks like being an attempt to unseat him. And they are very serious about it.One Tory MP fighting an important marginal seat had been cleared by his party to be away from Parliament but he is now staying for the vote, such is the importance of it.She told Deputy Speaker Lindsay Hoyle: ""It's just come to my attention that the government has tabled a motion for debate on the final day of this Parliament, with no notice whatsoever to myself as shadow leader of the House, proposing changes to the way in which the Speaker of this House is elected.""Procedural matters in this House, with no consultation with the opposition, no consultation with the chair of the committee itself, for debate in only one hour tomorrow.""Mr Hoyle said the motion had been ""rightly or wrongly"" agreed to on Tuesday, saying that ""business of the House is decided by the government, not by the chair.""A spokesman for Commons Leader William Hague said the motion had been tabled as a free hour had opened up in Thursday's business after the House of Lords approved the Modern Slavery Bill.The proposed change would apply when a Speaker wishes to continue in the post after a general election.Under the current rules, if the Speaker's re-appointment is objected to, a division is held, with MPs choosing to back or oppose the Speaker in the division lobbies.The replacement of this method with a secret ballot was suggested in 2010 by a committee of MPs, which said the public method ""can be seen as a deterrent to the House expressing its views honestly"".MPs will now debate whether this change should be made."

2015-04-03,MPs warn on growth of UK jihadists,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32059813,"Not enough is being done to prevent people leaving the UK to join Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, a group of MPs has warned.Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said Britain must win their ""hearts and minds"".The committee's report comes as the BBC launches a database tracking British jihadists in Syria and Iraq. It shows that many people left in clusters from certain UK areas - often due to friendships and peer groups. The MPs' report argued that preventative work with communities, families and international partners was ""vital"" and needs to be a top priority for the Home Office.  ""The number of cases being brought to public attention should ring alarm bells,"" said Labour MP Mr Vaz.  ""This must be a relentless battle for hearts and minds, and without a strong counter-narrative we are in danger of failing to prevent even more departures. We are at the edge of a cliff."" The BBC has been tracking the stories of the men, women, boys and girls who have gone to Syria and Iraq to understand why they go, where they go from and what happens to them. By analysing around 160 profiles, it reveals the way in which people have travelled in clusters - a group of three young friends from Coventry, another group from Portsmouth, drawn out by one person they knew, others in Cardiff linked to people involved in an extremist organisation. Social media might play a part but face-to-face contact appears just as, if not more, important, according to the database.It includes the stories of: The BBC research emphasises the extent to which real-world contacts, rather than just online connections, are often a key driver of radicalisation and intent to travel to Iraq and Syria. Some of the experts who appeared before the Home Affairs Committee also argued the internet was a secondary influence. They said that universities and prisons were among the two most significant places where radicalisation occurred. A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police, which was not aware of the report, said it would have ""welcomed the opportunity"" to have given evidence to the committee and that it planned to look at the report in detail.The disappearance of schoolgirls Shamima Begum, Amira Abase, both 15, and Kadiza Sultana, 16, from east London in February, raised questions as to who could have done more to prevent their departure. After taking evidence from the police and the families of the girls among others, Mr Vaz said their case suffered from a ""lack of immediate action"". He added: ""Schools and the police must inform parents immediately, and work with them even if there is the smallest hint of radicalisation, or a close association with someone who is thought to have been radicalised.""However, the Met Police spokesman defended the speed of the police response to the schoolgirls' disappearance.  He said the committee's criticism was ""misleading"", pointing to the evidence given by both UK and Turkish authorities of ""rapid exchanges"" between the two.The committee's report said there needed to be an advice service which would be a less extreme step than calling the anti-terrorist hotline.The Association of Chief Police Officer's lead officer for the government's anti-terror strategy Prevent, Chief Constable Sir Peter Fahy, agreed that more needed to be done.However, he said the police ""do not have the capacity"" to routinely work with every school in the country.He added: ""The police service will play its part but the prime responsibility for dissuading young people from getting involved in extremist activity has to lie with parents, families and carers.""The committee also pointed to weaknesses in information sharing with airlines and other countries. It said greater care needed to be taken at airport check-in desks when people were travelling to destinations of concern - namely Syria, Somalia, Iraq and Nigeria, as well as neighbouring countries, such as Turkey. The report said police also needed to work faster to alert overseas partners and airlines when there were concerns over individuals.There were signs that some of the girls had followed extremist accounts on social media, the report said.The committee said that social media companies, such as Facebook and Twitter, should be prepared to suspend accounts when there is evidence they are being used to promote violent extremism.  The report also said it was disappointed the Home Office had not implemented a programme for individuals returning to Britain where there is evidence they had fought in Syria.Security officials estimate that some 600 Britons have left the country to join IS - and while around half may have returned, many are still out there - and some have died.  The BBC project includes detailed profiles of individuals which can be searched, based on hometown, age and gender, as well as those who have been convicted in the courts or who are believed to have been killed."
2015-04-03,Ruling due on Prince Charles letters,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32061819,"The Supreme Court is set to rule on whether Prince Charles's letters to government should be made public.The UK's highest court has been asked to judge whether the Attorney General's office acted unlawfully when it prevented their publication in 2012.The Guardian newspaper is seeking the disclosure of the letters written to government departments between 2004-5.It has been argued that releasing the so-called ""black spider memos"" would undermine the prince.The Guardian said it had been ""pressing the government"" for 10 years to see the letters, written by the Prince of Wales to seven government departments.He is heir to the throne and, as the royal family's own website explains, it is central to the British constitution that the reigning monarch should remain politically neutral.The former Attorney General Dominic Grieve has said that any perception the prince had disagreed with the then Labour government in 2004-5 ""would be seriously damaging to his role as future monarch because if he forfeits his position of political neutrality as heir to the throne, he cannot easily recover it when he is king"".By BBC royal correspondent Peter HuntAfter 10 years, several court cases, and a cost to the taxpayer of hundreds of thousands of pounds, an end appears to be in sight for this dogged pursuit of Prince Charles's black spider memos.A final resolution will only be delayed if there's a referral on an issue of European law to the Court of Justice in Luxembourg. If not, the prince's private letters will either remain confidential, as the sender intended, or they'll be exposed to a large and inquisitive audience. His friends say he has a right and a duty to communicate with the government of the day. His critics accuse him of meddling and argue the way he operates should be transparent.One day, as things stand, he'll be king.As that day draws closer, the influence Prince Charles attempts to exert on ministers - and attempt he does - has greater relevance and significance.

2015-04-03,Tories and Labour VAT and NI pledges,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32047995,"David Cameron ruled out an increase in VAT if he retains power at the general election in his final Commons clash with Ed Miliband before polling day.The prime minister said this was a ""clear promise"" and challenged the Labour leader to rule out increasing National Insurance.Mr Miliband said ""nobody would believe"" Mr Cameron's pledge, because his government had raised VAT in 2010.Labour later announced it would not put National Insurance up.Mr Cameron's announcement was designed to neutralise one of Labour's main lines of attack - as seen on an election poster unveiled this week - that the Conservatives are secretly plotting to increase VAT because they will not be able to make their spending cut plans work without it.The announcement appeared to take Conservative MPs by surprise, especially after Chancellor George Osborne repeatedly declined to rule out a VAT increase when questioned by MPs on Tuesday.Analysis by political correspondent Iain WatsonToday's exchange actually raises more questions than it answers.If the main parties are ruling out further potential sources of revenue, but still committing themselves to eradicating a £90bn black hole in the public finances, will they now be under more pressure during the election campaign to spell out in much greater detail exactly what they intend to cut?Read Iain's full blogThe Conservatives have repeatedly accused Labour of secretly plotting to increase National Insurance contributions - but shadow chancellor Ed Balls has now ruled this out.Speaking just over an hour after Prime Minister's Questions, he told BBC News: ""We will make it clear in the manifesto Labour will not be raising NI. That will be a clear pledge from us.""He accused Mr Cameron of making an ""out of the blue, panicky"" announcement on VAT that ""no one in Britain will believe"".Labour, which has already announced plans to increase the top rate of income tax and impose a new ""mansion tax"" on high value properties, insists its plans are fully costed and will not require additional tax hikes if it wins May's general election.Mr Miliband began his final head-to-head encounter with Mr Cameron before the election by joking that the PM had ""announced his retirement plans"" - a reference to a BBC interview in which the prime minister said he would not serve a third term if the Tories remained in power.Challenging Mr Cameron to give a ""straight answer to a straight question"", Mr Miliband pressed him on whether he would rule out a rise in VAT after the election, as Labour had done.In response, the prime minister immediately said ""yes"", prompting loud cheers in turn from the Conservative benches. He contrasted what he said was a ""clear promise"" with Labour's unwillingness to rule out a rise in National Insurance.""I answered a very simple question about VAT. I ruled out an increase... straight answer to him, straight question from me. I have ruled out VAT. Will he rule out national insurance contributions. Yes or no?"" Mr Cameron added: ""We all know this is Labour's job tax. This is their tax of choice. This is what they clobber working people, families and enterprises with.""But Mr Miliband responded by saying there was ""only one person who is going to raise taxes on working families and that is him"".He said nobody would believe Mr Cameron on VAT ""because of his extreme spending plans, because his numbers do not add up and because he promised it last time and broke his promise"".Mr Cameron, he added, had broken other promises made before the last election to reduce annual net migration below 100,000 and not to pursue a major structural re-organisation of the NHS, adding that it was ""time for a better plan and time for a Labour government"".But Mr Cameron suggested a future Labour government would result in the ""chaos of economic crisis"", with Ed Miliband being ""held hostage"" by the SNP.The packed session provided a last opportunity for the two men to rally their MPs and set out their arguments before the start of the election campaign next week.Speaking after the exchanges and the other parties' tax pledges, deputy prime minister Nick Clegg said the Lib Dems ""don't need to raise VAT, national insurance or headline rates of income tax or corporation tax either"".""There are other taxes and other tax loopholes that we can increase or close in order to balance the books,"" he said.

2015-04-03,Met police 'had files on MPs in 90s',https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32044580,"A former undercover police officer has told BBC News that Scotland Yard kept intelligence files on MPs during the 1990s. Ex-Special Branch officer Peter Francis says he saw files on 10 Labour MPs which he and others regularly updated. He says he personally gathered information on three MPs as part of his work infiltrating left-wing groups. The MPs named, and Labour, have called for a forthcoming public inquiry into undercover policing to be widened. Mr Francis operated undercover between 1993 and 1997 in the Met's now disbanded Special Demonstration Squad. He was told to embed himself in left-wing groups or causes that were deemed to pose a potential threat to security. He says that during this period he was told to gather intelligence on MPs and their activities if and when they featured in any of his operations. That information, he says, was added to a special pink file that was available for Special Branch officers to read. Between 1990 and 2001, he claims to have personally seen records relating to Diane Abbott, the late Tony Benn, Jeremy Corbyn, the late Bernie Grant, Peter Hain, Harriet Harman, Ken Livingstone, Joan Ruddock, Dennis Skinner and Jack Straw.Four of the group became ministers during Mr Francis's time in Special Branch - including Jack Straw who was home secretary after 1997. ""When I was deployed undercover in the Special Demonstration Squad, any MP that I came across, such as on demonstrations, I would report back on them,"" he said. Mr Francis says that the files not only contained the MPs' publicly-stated political views - but also intelligence on what was going on behind the scenes in the party or their group. He says some of the information would have been things said in private by the MP, depending on how close each undercover officer had been able to get. Mr Francis said that when he first saw the files he understood that each had probably been created before the individual was an MP because of their personal involvement in radical causes or protests.But he added: ""When they became MPs these files carried on. It [was] your duty as an SDS officer to report back any intelligence that you come across. ""I felt that it was OK to report back on MPs,"" he said. ""I used to give myself a pat on the back, thinking 'I have done a good job'. These MPs were spied on and they should know.""""I don't think the police force should be monitoring MPs, full stop. I don't think we have any right to do that at all. It may be justifiable to say that the Security Service should be doing it - but I certainly don't think the police should be doing it.""Scotland Yard has refused to comment on the substance of the claims, but a spokesman said it had not shied away from serious allegations about the SDS. It said that Operation Herne, the internal police investigation into what happened in the unit, remained an ongoing investigation.""Operation Herne maintains that without speaking to Peter Francis it is simply not possible to fully investigate allegations he makes,"" said a spokesman. ""Operation Herne remains very willing to engage with him.""Mr Francis said that he has refused to speak to Operation Herne because he fears being interviewed under caution as a suspect, rather than a whistleblower. Scotland Yard told the BBC that Operation Herne detectives would be prepared to speak to him as a witness. He has, however, spoken to Mark Ellison QC who reviewed allegations about the SDS for the Home Secretary Theresa May - prompting her to launch a statutory inquiry. He says he will appear before those hearings. Peter Hain, who was a leader of the anti-apartheid movement in the late 1960s and 70s and became an MP in 1991, said he now wants full answers from Scotland Yard. ""I was deeply disturbed to find that files were still being kept by the Special Branch while I and others were serving Members of Parliament,"" he said. ""That is constitutionally an outrage. It infringes the sovereignty of Parliament. ""I want to see the home secretary widen the scope of the inquiry into the SDS to look specifically at the surveillance of MPs and the fact that there were active files on us while we were serving Members of Parliament. ""This should never have happened and it should have been reported and properly authorised - and we don't know whether it was.""Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper echoed the call for the inquiry to be widened in light of what she described as ""extremely serious and disturbing allegations"".""While undercover policing remains a crucial tool in combating serious and organised crime it must not be abused,"" she said.""There have now been a series of serious allegations about undercover policing - ranging from the treatment of Stephen Lawrence's family to police having long-term inappropriate relationships. ""We called some time ago for much stronger oversight of undercover policing and it is also vital to get to the truth about what has happened."" Mrs May announced earlier this month that Lord Justice Pitchford would lead the inquiry into the SDS allegations - but the precise shape of that inquiry is not yet clear.A Home Office spokesman said the review by Mark Ellison QC had unearthed ""serious historical failings"". ""That is why the Home Secretary established a public inquiry to thoroughly investigate undercover policing and the operation of the Special Demonstration Squad. ""Lord Justice Pitchford will consult interested parties to the inquiry over the coming months on setting the terms of reference, with a view to publishing these at the end of July.""Undercover policing is an essential tactic in the fight against crime but to improve the public's confidence in undercover work we must ensure there is no repeat of these failings in the future."""
2015-04-03,NHS problems worst 'since 1990s',https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/health-32057948,"Services in the NHS in England are deteriorating in a way not seen since the early 1990s, according to a leading health think tank. The King's Fund review said waiting times for A&E, cancer care and routine operations had all started getting worse, while deficits were growing.It said such drops in performance had not been seen for 20 years.But the think tank acknowledged the NHS had done as well as could be expected, given the financial climate.Professor John Appleby, chief economist at the King's Fund, which specialises in health care policy, said: ""The next government will inherit a health service that has run out of money and is operating at the very edge of its limits. ""There is now a real risk that patient care will deteriorate as service and financial pressures become overwhelming.""He said in terms of how standards were slipping - not how low they had reached - the situation was the worst it had been since the ""early 1990s"".The report noted much of the deterioration has happened in the second-half of the Parliament with many measures of performance being maintained in the first few years.It said the next government had to address the funding situation, adding the extra £8bn a year NHS England says is needed by 2020, was the ""minimum"" that would be required.The report - a review of performance this Parliament - highlights a range of problems as well as achievements. These include:The report is the second part of the King's Fund pre-election review of the NHS this Parliament.Last month it warned the coalition government's reforms of the health service had been ""damaging and distracting"".The King's Fund report should make worrying reading. The reference to the 1990s conjures up images of - for the NHS at least - a bygone era. The think tank's point was not that waiting times had reached the level they were at then, rather that this is the first time in two decades of almost continuous improvement that there has been a sustained drop in performance.In many ways, that had to happen. Services cannot keep getting better for ever. Nonetheless, the findings are crystal clear: the NHS is at a critical juncture. But what is less easy to determine is to what extent the coalition's policies have contributed to the difficulties.The think tank has already provided a critical analysis of the government's reforms - and when pushed, acknowledged the health service may have been ""in better shape"" if they had not happened.But the more significant issue for the health of the health service this Parliament has been the squeeze on finances. Even though the budget has been increased, it has felt more like a cut to many because demands have risen so quickly.On this though, the King's Fund accepted that the government's hands were tied. Given the state of the economy, ministers did as much as they could have.Read more from NickRoyal College of Nursing general secretary Peter Carter said politicians needed to take note of the warnings made by the King's Fund.""Morale is low, and more and more staff are being made sick with stress because of the intolerable pressure they are under,"" he added. Katherine Murphy, of the Patients Association, said: ""The findings echo what we are hearing on a daily basis on our helpline. It is clear to the public that the future of the NHS is one of the most important issues facing the nation and it should be a central issue in the election campaign.""Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham said: ""Five years ago David Cameron stood on a promise to protect the NHS. This report provides authoritative proof that he has broken that promise.""But a Department of Health spokesman said: ""As the King's Fund says, the NHS has 'performed well in the face of huge challenges', but if we are to continue to invest in the NHS going forward it needs to be backed by a strong economy.""

2015-04-03,SNP 'could block Tory government',https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32045419,"The SNP would block a minority Conservative government by voting down its Queen's Speech if it holds the post-election balance of power, its former leader Alex Salmond has said.Mr Salmond said the move could bring down the government if Labour joined in, with David Cameron ""locked out"".The Conservatives accused him of ""trying to sabotage the democratic will of the British people"".Labour has called his balance of power prediction ""bluster and bluff"".In recent days Mr Salmond, who is bidding to become a Westminster MP at the 7 May general election, has claimed his party could ""hold the power"" in a hung Parliament and would be able to influence the Budget of a minority Labour government.This was dismissed by Labour leader Ed Miliband, who has ruled out a formal coalition with the Scottish nationalists.The SNP currently has six MPs at Westminster, but recent opinion polls suggest its share could increase dramatically at the general election.James Cook, BBC News Scotland correspondentIf the Conservatives attempt to form a minority government and enough MPs vote against their Queen's Speech the administration would fall at the first hurdle and the leader of the opposition would have a shot at forming a government.That's how parliamentary democracy works in the event of a hung Parliament.And yet the Conservatives are saying that by planning to vote against a government he opposes Alex Salmond has ""confirmed he would sabotage the democratic will of the British people in order to make Ed Miliband prime minister"".It is part of their continuing attempt to portray Mr Miliband as a weak leader whose strings are being pulled by Mr Salmond.This kind of language causes despair among Tories north of the border who fear that the party in London is waltzing into an SNP trap.They know that many voters in Scotland will read the phrase ""democratic will of the British people"" and hear ""democratic will of the English people"".Because, if it is illegitimate for Scottish MPs, from whatever party, to vote against one government and support another in the British parliament, then what, voters may ask, is the point of the union?Who is dancing to Mr Salmond's tune now?Mr Salmond, the former Scottish first minister, told the New Statesman that in the event of a hung Parliament, a minority Conservative government would have to ""go straight effectively for a vote of confidence - usually the Queen's Speech, although it could be otherwise, of course - and we'd be voting against.""If David Cameron lost this vote, he said, there would be a two-week period for another government to be formed.BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said Mr Salmond had ""hardened his anti-Conservative rhetoric"" in the interview.A Conservative spokesman said:  ""Alex Salmond has confirmed he would sabotage the democratic will of the British people in order to make Ed Miliband prime minister. ""That would mean chaos for Britain, with weak Ed Miliband dancing to Alex Salmond's tune.""He said the ""only way to keep Britain together"" was to vote Conservative.Mr Salmond's latest comments come after Mr Miliband said the only people writing a future Labour Budget would be himself and shadow chancellor Ed Balls.Speaking in Clydebank on Monday, he added: ""It's not going to be Alex Salmond - not in a million years."""
2015-04-03,MPs criticise 'lack of EU debate',https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32045290,"The government's ""failure"" to let MPs debate EU legislation is ""deplorable"", a Parliamentary committee says.The European Scrutiny Committee said ministers had refused to schedule debates on issues such as free movement and the EU's Budget.It also said BBC coverage of EU matters should be ""improved substantially"".The government said the number of EU debates had doubled since 2009-10, while the BBC said its coverage was ""extensive and impartial"".The cross-party committee's role includes scrutinising EU documents and recommending the most important for debate in the House of Commons.Its report said in the period covering most of the 2014-15 financial year there were three debates on the floor of the House, compared with 12 in 2013-14.It also pointed out that not a single debate had taken place during a nine-month period, between 9 June 2014 and 9 March 2015.""The government's collective failure to schedule so many debates on EU documents over the past year is deplorable, and is a discourtesy to this committee and to all members of the House,"" the MPs said.Prime Minister David Cameron has sought to rally support from other EU leaders for his plans to curb welfare payments to European migrants ahead of a referendum on the UK's membership if he wins the general election.The committee said the government's ""cavalier"" approach was ""at odds with UK ministers' claims in their speeches across the EU about the role of national parliaments"".The Foreign Office said the government was committed to a ""strong EU scrutiny system that enables Parliament to hold it to account for the decisions taken in Brussels"".It added: ""We have made good on our commitment to raise standards by doubling the number of Europe debates on the floor of the House since 2009-10.""This government has also increased by around a fifth since 2010 the number of EU proposals that have been scrutinised and cleared by Parliament before being agreed in Brussels.""The committee has also been examining the BBC's coverage of European issues, taking evidence from director general Lord Hall and head of news James Harding earlier this month.During that appearance, Lord Hall said the desire for balanced output ""ran deep"" within the BBC and he believed that this was being achieved.Mr Harding said if the public was going to trust the BBC to report on politicians impartially it had to be clear that BBC journalists weren't ""asked by politicians to come and account for what they do and in effect do the bidding of those politicians"".But the committee said it was ""concerned about the manner in which the BBC treats EU issues"", calling for coverage to be ""improved substantially"".It suggested coverage did not reflect all sides of the debate on the European Union, and more analysis was needed. Its chairman, Conservative MP Sir William Cash, said the BBC had ""very particular obligations"" to be impartial and to ""educate and inform"".He added:  ""We do not believe this is currently being achieved in the context of the BBC's EU coverage.""A BBC spokesman said the corporation provided extensive and impartial coverage of European and Parliamentary issues, and it would be a breach of the corporation's independence if a committee of MPs instructed the BBC on its coverage."
2015-04-03,Lobbyists must 'conform' with rules,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32047992,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe woman in charge of the government's new register of lobbyists has said she expects the industry to ""conform"" with the statutory system. Speaking ahead of the register's launch, Alison White conceded a lot of lobbyists would not be listed on it.But she said her job was to make sure the rules were implemented and she would do so with ""extreme verve and vigour.""But one critic of the register said it was ""fake"" and full of ""loopholes"".Lobbyists are companies or individuals paid to influence government decisions.The coalition promised to introduce a statutory register of lobbyists when it came to power in 2010, and legislation was passed last year, with ministers saying the move would help clean up politics.However, the new register will only cover consultant lobbyists and will not apply to lobbyists working ""in-house"" for companies or organisations.A person or company will only need to be registered if they are contacting a government minister or permanent secretary in a government department - leading to criticism it will not come close to reflecting the scale or nature of lobbying that goes on across Whitehall.But Ms White, who is independent of the government, said her task was to implement the law as it stood not to question the powers she had been given. ""We are having something that has never been in place before,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""This is a statutory register. The industry tells me it is a professional industry. I expect them to conform with the legislation. It is my job to make sure they do so.""Ms White, who was appointed as the registrar of consultant lobbyists in September, acknowledged the register would not indicate different ""levels of lobbying"".""The legislation was quite narrowly drafted to address a particular issue, which was that it was not always particularly clear, when ministers were being lobbied, who the client of the lobbyist was. That is what the register was set up to do,"" she said.She added: ""This will give anyone who wishes to access the register the opportunity to be able to see who is lobbying and being paid for it and who their clients are. That is the main information the register will contain.""If a lobbyist sets out to influence government policy in some way, they would have to be registered. If they are not registered, then they would not be conforming. They have to go on the register before they lobby.""Ms White said last month that the register would not have any entries on its launch day but she had received more than ""20 expressions of interest"" about joining and companies and individuals might be required to sign up retrospectively.Potential registrants will be able to log on and create an account to file an ""information return"".But Tamasin Cave, from the Alliance for Lobbying Transparency coalition, said ""hardly anyone"" in the industry would be covered by the provisions of the new law. ""You have a huge commercial lobbying industry, and very few of them will have to sign up,"" she told Today.""The second flaw is that it won't show the interaction between lobbyists and government, and that is what a register is for.""It is to show the activity - who is discussing what with whom, but this shows nothing of this interaction. It is a fake register."""
2015-04-03,Car smoking ban MSP welcomes backing,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-south-scotland-32055226,"The Liberal Democrat MSP behind a bill to ban smoking in cars when children are present has welcomed the support of the Scottish government.South of Scotland MSP Jim Hume launched the members' bill in December.The government said it was ""very supportive"" of the principles of the bill, but changes could be needed to make it ""workable"".Motorists could potentially be fined £100 for breaching the rule if it becomes law.Mr Hume lodged draft proposals for a bill last May calling for a ban in Scotland on smoking in private vehicles when children under 18 were present.He said he was ""over the moon"" at the news the Scottish government would endorse the Smoking Prohibition (Children in Motor Vehicles) (Scotland) Bill.He said: ""With cross-party support and the support of many third sector organisations, there is every chance that this could be in place in the next year.""Eighty-four per cent of the 160 responses to my consultation were positive and people from across Scotland have expressed their support for the move.""The bill is about guaranteeing that children in Scotland can have the freedom to go on and lead healthy lives if they choose to.""I look forward to working with MSPs from all parties as the bill progresses.""Public Health Minister Maureen Watt said the Scottish government had considered including the measure in its Public Health Bill, but instead decided to support Mr Hume's proposals.She said: ""As with any bill, as it goes through the scrutiny process, there may be amendments and improvements to strengthen the legislation and ensure it is fit for purpose. ""But we believe that the underpinning principles are strong, and that is why I am pleased to support it.""Scottish Labour and a wide range of health organisations have backed his proposals.But the Scottish Conservatives have reservations about how the bill would work in practice.The party's health spokesman Jackson Carlaw said: ""While Scottish Conservatives support any moves which would protect young people from hazardous second hand smoke we have concerns as to how this would be enforced.""It would be a better use of resources to conduct a public awareness campaign similar to that which is being proposed by the government in Wales.""We will be watching this campaign in order to ascertain what lessons may be learned and what approaches may be adopted in Scotland.""Anti-smoking campaigners welcomed the Scottish government's backing for Mr Hume's bill.ASH Scotland's chief executive Sheila Duffy said: ""It is another public health initiative that can help Scotland move forward with its ambition to achieve a tobacco-free generation in 20 years' time.""It is popular with the public and will bring Scotland into line with upcoming legislation in England and Wales.""We believe it can be effectively enforced and that having the legislation focus on cars with children bypasses concerns over interference in people's private lives.""Jim Hume must be congratulated for taking the initiative on this proposal and for all the hard work he and his team have done to bring this important measure forward.""But Simon Clark, director of the smokers' group Forest, said the bill was ""legislation for legislation's sake"".He said: ""Smoking in cars carrying children is inconsiderate. The overwhelming majority of smokers know that and don't do it.""The very small number that do will carry on regardless because the law will be difficult, if not impossible, to enforce.""Education has to be better than legislation but the government prefers gesture politics and the big stick."""
2015-04-03,Candidate quits over UKIP MEP remark,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32038485,"A UKIP election candidate has quit the party over comments made by the party's only Scottish MEP about a Scottish government minister.Tim Wilson has decided not to stand in South Northamptonshire after David Coburn MEP compared Humza Yousaf to convicted terrorist Abu Hamza.Mr Coburn has apologised for the remarks, saying it was a ""joke"".A spokesman for UKIP said Mr Wilson had failed to emphasise local issues in his general election campaign.UKIP leader Nigel Farage said Mr Coburn's remarks were a ""joke in poor taste"" but he would not be taking any action against him.But Mr Wilson said he was disillusioned with the party over the ""racist jibes"" and has decided to stand down.He told BBC Scotland he was appalled by Mr Coburn's comments about Mr Yousaf and frustrated by the inaction of the party's leadership on the issue.  He said David Coburn had produced ""what I can only describe as an Islamaphobic insult, and that's simply not acceptable"".  Mr Wilson added: ""Of course he went on and apologised.  I think, frankly, that if you are in a position of power you have to be able to control what ideas emerge from your head and how they get to your mouth and, in fact, you shouldn't have those ideas in the first place.  ""But the real issue is that when Mr Farage was asked what he thought about this he dismissed this as a joke.  ""I don't think this is a joke. I think this is something very serious.  It may not be that this man intended to cause offence but we aren't interested in what his intentions are.  We are interested in the effect what he says has on other people and the effect is catastrophic, it's appalling and I've resigned.""In his resignation letter, Mr Wilson said he had been ""systematically gagged by the party whip"" and forbidden to speak about Islam favourably. A spokesman for UKIP said Mr Wilson had failed to put more emphasis on local issues in his campaign.He said: ""Whilst we had initially been optimistic about Tim Wilson's abilities as a candidate, it became obvious in recent weeks that he was out of his depth in representing our party in the way we would expect. ""Mr Wilson had clearly misunderstood the expectations that UKIP place on all of its candidates. Principal amongst those is focusing on issues that are relevant to local voters. UKIP put huge emphasis on local issues and Mr Wilson was unwilling to follow UKIP guidelines in this respect.""Last week MSPs at the Scottish Parliament unanimously condemned the remarks made by Mr Coburn during a newspaper interview.MSPs were debating a motion celebrating Scotland's diverse communities.The president of the European Parliament, Martin Schulz, condemned the remarks, saying they were ""not worthy of any elected member"". But a spokesman for the president said he could not act on remarks made outside parliament.The move comes just days after another candidate, Jonathan Stanley, quit in protest at the ""racist filth"" in UKIP. Mr Stanley, who was due to stand in the Cumbrian seat of Westmorland and Lonsdale, was the party's former head of policy in Scotland."

2015-04-03,Manifesto watch,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-29642613,"Political parties are putting together their manifestos for May's general election. Here's a guide to where they currently stand on the issues voters say they care about most (according to pollsters IPSOS Mori).ImmigrationConservatives:  David Cameron wants to make migrants wait four years before they can claim certain benefits, such as tax credits, Universal Credit, or get access to social housing. He wants to stop migrants from claiming child benefit for dependents living outside the UK, and remove those that have failed to find work after six months. Mr Cameron has promised to put reform of EU free movement rules at the heart of his renegotiation of Britain's relationship with the EU. He has ruled out a temporary cap on migrant numbers or an ""emergency brake"" on EU freedom of movement rules - ideas both mooted in recent months, saying this would be less ""effective"" than reducing the incentives for people to come to the UK. The party has a continuing goal to bring net immigration down to below 100,000 people a year (it currently stands at 243,000).Labour: ""Stronger"" border controls to tackle illegal immigration with ""proper"" entry and exit checks. ""Smarter"" targets to reduce low-skilled migration but ensure university students and high-skilled workers are not deterred. Employment agencies who only recruit abroad will be outlawed while the fines for employing illegal immigrants will be increased.Lib Dems: Reintroduce exit checks at borders, so the government can identify people who are overstaying their visa. Will require all new claimants for Jobseekers Allowance to have their English language skills assessed, with JSA then being conditional on attending language courses for those whose English is poor. Ensure that EU migrants have to ""earn"" their entitlement to benefits.SNP: Allow the devolved government to have control over immigration to Scotland, and introduce a Canadian-style earned citizenship system to attract highly-skilled immigrants.Plaid Cymru: Oppose a points-based system. Support the right of asylum seekers to work in Wales while they wait for status decisions to be made. Lobby the Westminster government to ensure that they shut ""detention"" centres.UKIP: Introduce an Australian-style points policy, used to select migrants with the skills and attributes needed to work in the country - covering people from inside and outside the EU. Bring net immigration down to 50,000 people a year. Priority lanes for UK passport holders. Increase UK border staff by 2,500. Tougher English language tests for migrants seeking permanent residence. Opt out of the Dublin treaty to allow the UK to return asylum seekers to other EU countries without considering their claim. Anyone who currently has the legal right to live, work, or study in the UK would not face deportation in the event of the country's withdrawal from the EU.Greens:  Progressively reduce UK immigration controls. Migrants illegally in the UK for over five years will be allowed to remain unless they pose a serious danger to public safety. More legal rights for asylum seekers.Taxes and the economyConservatives: Eradicate the deficit by 2018 and secure an overall budget surplus by 2019-20. Achieve this by spending cuts, not tax rises, while raising NHS spending. An income tax cut for 30 million people by 2020. Tax would start to kick in at £12,500 a year, instead of £10,500. This will cost £5.6bn. The higher tax rate, 40%, would start at £50,000 instead of £41,900, again by 2020, at a cost of £1.6bn. This will be paid for through £25bn in additional spending cuts and economic growth. No increases in VAT.Labour: Get the current budget into surplus and the national debt falling ""as soon as possible in the next parliament"". No additional borrowing for new spending. Reintroduce the 50p top rate of income tax for earnings over £150,000.  Cut income tax for 24 million people by bringing back the 10p rate, paid for by scrapping the Married Couples' Tax Allowance. Bring in a ""mansion tax"" on properties worth over £2m, to raise £1.2bn. A tax on bankers' bonuses. A 5% pay cut for every government minister. Push for UK overseas territories to be put on an international blacklist if they refuse to co-operate with a drive against tax avoidance. No increases in VAT or National Insurance contributions.Lib Dems: Raise the personal allowance - the point at which you start paying income tax - to £11,000 in April 2016 and then to £12,500 by 2020. ""Strict new fiscal rules"" to ensure the deficit has gone by April 2018, with the wealthy contributing the most. The Lib Dems invented the ""mansion tax"" but in contrast to Labour have set out how it would operate - along similar lines to council tax bands. There are also Lib Dem plans to increase capital gains tax - paid on profits from second homes or shares - from 28% to 35%. Impose an additional 8% rate of corporation tax on UK banks to raise an extra £1bn a year to help pay off the deficit.SNP: Oppose UK plans in the Infrastructure Bill which will allow oil and gas drilling and hydraulic fracturing beneath people's homes without consent. Invest in offshore wind farming. Support an international bank tax and limits to industry bonuses.Plaid Cymru: Build a Green Skills Construction College, specialising in green energy. Establish a publicly-owned energy company. Establish a publicly-owned Bank of Wales business investment bank. Enforce a living wage. Give devolved nations an equal say in institutions that affect everyone's lives, such as the Bank of England.UKIP: Increase the personal allowance to the level of full-time minimum wage earnings, about £13,500, by 2020. Abolish inheritance tax. Introduce a 35% income tax rate between £42,285 and £55,000, at which point the 40% rate becomes payable. Set up a Treasury Commission to design a turnover tax on large businesses. Cut foreign aid budget by £9bn a year. Scrap HS2. Save £8bn a year in membership fees by leaving the EU.  Lower the VAT rate charged on restorations to listed buildings.Greens: People earning more than £100,000 a year would pay 50% income tax. Wealth tax of 1% to 2% on people worth £3m or more. Renationalise the railways and energy companies. Scrap HS2. Allow councils to impose extra business rates on out-of-town supermarkets to fund small local businesses. Crackdown on tax avoidance by multinationals. Allow ""the current dependence on economic growth to cease, and allow zero or negative growth to be feasible without individual hardship"". Commit Britain to a ""zero carbon"" future. Cut rail and bus fares by an average of 10%. Enforce a cap on bankers' bonuses.The NHSConservatives:  Chancellor George Osborne says he will put an extra £2bn into frontline health services across the UK, which he described as a ""down payment"" on a plan drawn up by NHS bosses calling for an extra £8bn a year above inflation by 2020. In England, everyone would be able to see a GP seven days a week by 2020. Recruit 5,000 more doctors.Labour:  Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said Labour would commit an extra £2.5bn a year above Mr Osborne's plan. The money will come from three sources - a new ""mansion"" tax, clamping down on tax avoidance by big corporations and a new tax on tobacco companies. Patients in England would get a GP appointment within 48 hours and would not have to wait longer than a week for cancer tests and results. Scrap the Health and Social Care Act and end ""creeping privatisation"" of the NHS.  Integrate health and social care services into a system of ""whole-person care"". Give greater priority to mental health services. Replace the Cancer Drugs Fund in England when it runs out in 2016 with a £330m fund to improve access to innovative cancer drugs, surgery and radiotherapy. Recruit 5,000 more healthcare workers to help patients stay in their homes and introduce new safety checks to identify people at risk of hospitalisation. Prioritise child mental health by increasing the proportion of the mental health budget spent on children.Lib Dems: An extra £1bn for the NHS every year, to be funded by - amongst other things - making higher earners pay more tax on their shares. Half of this will go towards mental health. Ensure that spending on the NHS rises in line with growth in the economy. People who need therapy for conditions such as depression will be guaranteed treatment within 18 weeks. For young patients experiencing psychosis for the first time treatment will be provided within two weeks of being referred by a GP. This is all going to happen from April, with more mental health targets to follow if the Lib Dems return to government. Wants a cross-party review of the future of NHS funding.SNP: Reduce the number of senior managers in the NHS by 25% over the next parliament. Streamline the work of health boards. Real terms increases in year-on-year NHS spending.Plaid Cymru: Recruit 1,000 extra doctors to the Welsh NHS over two terms of a Plaid government. Offer financial incentives for recruiting doctors to areas and specialisms where there are, or are predicted to be, shortages. Encourage innovation and attract more research funding, in part by increasing research and development funding as government finance allows. Improve training for postgraduate doctors and stop them being used to ""plug gaps"" in staff rotas. More recruitment from within the EU to fill vacancies and using international doctors to staff the NHS while a new generation of Welsh doctors are trained.UKIP: An extra £3bn per year in NHS funding paid for by quitting the EU and through ""middle management"" cuts. Keep NHS free at the point of delivery. Stop any further use of PFI, and encourage local authorities to buy out their PFI contracts early where it is affordable to do so. Ensure all visitors and migrants who have been here for fewer than five years have NHS-approved medical insurance as a condition of entry to UK, with £200m of the £2bn saved to be spent on ending hospital parking charges in England. Bring back state-enrolled nurses and return powers to matrons. Monitor and Care Quality Commission to be replaced with elected county health boards. Stop spending £90m a year on gastric band and breast enhancement operations.Greens: Funding to be diverted away from centralised facilities towards community healthcare, illness prevention and health promotion.  Stop privatisation. Abolish prescription charges. Dedicated NHS Tax to go direct to the health service. Ban proactive recruitment of non-British NHS staff from overseas. A complete ban on the promotion of tobacco and alcohol products, including sponsorship.Security, defence and foreign affairsConservatives: Hold a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU by 2017, after negotiating the return of some powers from Brussels. Protect foreign aid budget. Replace Trident.Labour:  Push for reform of European Union and prevent Britain from ""sleepwalking"" towards exit. Commit in law to holding a Strategic Defence and Security Review every 5 years. Outlaw discrimination and abuse of Armed Forces personnel.Lib Dems: Campaign to reduce the number of Trident nuclear submarines. Push for greater European Union efficiency. SNP: Oppose nuclear weapons and push for removal of Trident submarines from Scotland. In 2010, proposed a Scottish Centre for Reconciliation and Conflict Resolution, to promote peaceful alternatives to armed conflict. Maintain 0.7% commitment to foreign aid. Enhanced role for Scotland within the UK in Europe, particularly in fisheries policy.Plaid Cymru: Honour commitment of 0.7% of budget used for foreign aid. Campaign for cancellation of developing countries' debts. Support the Fair Trade movement. Support the 'Tobin' or 'Robin hood' tax as a means of encouraging more responsibility and stability in the global markets. Reform the IMF and World Bank in order to improve regulation and accountability. Continue membership of the EU, but campaign for democratic reform. Support minority nations and minority language speakers around the world. Pass a Military Wellbeing Act to promote and safeguard the physical and mental health and wellbeing of military personnel.UKIP:  Leave the European Union. Remove the passports of any person who has gone to fight for a terrorist organisation and deport anyone who has committed a terrorist act. Cut foreign aid budget by £9bn. Create a Veterans Department to look after the interests of ex-service men and women.Greens: Referendum on Britain's EU membership. Want reform of EU to hand powers back to local communities. Boost overseas aid to 1% of GDP within 10 years. Scrap Britain's nuclear weapons. Take the UK out of NATO unilaterally. End the so-called ""special relationship"" between the UK and the US.  Stop EU-US free trade deal TTIP. JobsConservatives: Create three million apprenticeships to be paid for by benefit cuts.Labour: Guarantee a job for under 25s unemployed for over a year and adults unemployed for more than two years. As many young people to go on an apprenticeship as currently go to university by 2025. Create a million new high technology, green jobs by 2025. Ban ""exploitative"" zero hour contracts.Lib Dems: An extra £1 an hour for the lowest paid apprentices. Campaign to create a million more jobs.SNP: Introduce gender quotas on public boards. Living wage ""a central priority"" in all Scottish government contracts. Continue the 'small business bonus'.Plaid Cymru: Provide rates relief for small businesses. Increase the number and value of contracts from Welsh public bodies that go to firms within Wales.UKIP: Allow firms to offer jobs to British workers first ""without the fear of being sued for discrimination"".Greens: A national energy conservation scheme to create thousands of new jobs. The party wants to create ""sustainable jobs"" and promotes more local production of food and goods.Education Conservatives: Protect England's schools budget - from reception entry at age four or five to the end of GCSEs at 16 - in cash terms although funding per pupil will not keep pace with inflation. Pre-school and post 16 education not ring fenced. Convert up to 3,500 more schools judged by Ofsted to ""require improvement"" into academies. ""War on illiteracy and innumeracy"". State primary schools in England that repeatedly failed to have a proportion of year-six pupil pass times tables and writing tests be forced to become academies, or have sponsorship replaced if already an academy. Opposed to giving votes to 16 and 17-year-olds for UK-wide general elections and local elections in England.Labour:  Increase the overall education budget in England, including schools, nurseries, Sure Start and provision for 16-to 18-year-olds, by at least the rate of inflation, although per-pupil funding is not specifically protected, meaning some of the increase will be eaten up by rising pupil numbers. Parents of primary school children would be guaranteed childcare from 8am to 6pm. The amount of free childcare for three and four year olds would be increased from 15 to 25 hours a week. Compulsory sex and relationship education in all schools. Refuse to grant business rate relief to independent schools unless they can show a ""meaningful impact"" on state schools through a new School Partnership Standard, for example by lending teaching staff or assisting in university admissions procedures. Committed to extending the franchise to 16 and 17-year-olds in elections across the UK. Double the number of Sure Start childcare places to more than 118,000. Tighten up the rules on primary school class sizes to ensure they do not have more than 30 pupils.Lib Dems: Protect the education budget from cuts. Guarantee qualified teachers and a core curriculum set by independent experts, as well as compulsory sex education, in all state schools including academies and free schools. More money for disadvantaged school children and free childcare for all two year olds. A two-thirds discount on all local bus fares for young people aged 16-21. Supports lowering the voting age to 16 in all UK elections.SNP: Guaranteed free 30 hours of childcare a week for three and four-year-olds in Scotland, up from 16 hours. Maintain lack of tuition fees at Scottish universities, and offer financial support in grants and loans to students. Continue to build and refurbish schools. Lower voting age to 16 in all UK elections.Plaid Cymru: Introduce a compulsory modern foreign language GCSE in secondary schools and the teaching of modern foreign languages in primary schools. Look at ways to strengthen the teaching of Welsh history and culture. Oppose foundation schools, academies and free schools. Look at moving from a per-pupil funding mechanism to a funding model based on the catchment area. Will not support any further increases in tuition fees for higher education students, and will seek the abolition of tuition fees as and when public finances allow. Supports lowering the voting age to 16 for elections to the Welsh Assembly and the UK Parliament.UKIP: More grammar schools. Scrap sex education for children aged under seven. Scrap tuition fees for students from poorer backgrounds who take degree courses in the sciences, technology, maths or engineering. Greater emphasis on vocational education with new Apprenticeship Qualification Option. School governing boards must be made up of at least 30% parents of children at the school. Allow universities to charge same amount for EU students as non-EU students.Greens: End performance related pay for teachers. Replace Ofsted with an independent National Council for Educational Excellence. Bring Free Schools and Academies into local authority control.

Withdraw Jobseeker's Allowance from young people after six months unless they take part in ""community projects"". And 18 to 21-year-olds wouldn't be entitled to housing benefit. Ban on zero-hours contracts which stop people getting work elsewhere. Raise the personal allowance - the point at which you start paying income tax - to £11,000 in April 2016 and then to £12,500 by 2020, which means that if you work on minimum wage for 30 hours you will pay no income tax. Young people out of work, education or training for six months will have to do unpaid community work to get benefits. This will apply to about 50,000 18 to 21-year-olds. Universal benefits for pensioners, such as free bus passes, TV licences for the over 75s and the winter fuel allowance. will once again be protected. Labour: Freeze energy prices until 2017. Increase in the minimum wage from £6.50-an-hour to £8-an-hour by 2020. Rises in child benefit capped at 1% for the first two years of the next parliament. Winter fuel allowance would be withdrawn from the wealthiest pensioners. Repeal what the government calls the spare room subsidy, dubbed the ""bedroom tax"" by Labour.  A million interest-free loans to help people insulate their homes. Rail fares would be capped. Double the amount of paid paternity leave available to new fathers from two to four weeks, and increase statutory paternity pay to £260 a week.Lib Dems: Raise the personal allowance - the point at which you start paying income tax - to £11,000 in April 2016 and then to £12,500 by 2020 (the Conservatives are promising the same thing). Nick Clegg has said he would not accept Conservative plans to freeze working-age benefits without taxing the rich too. He hasn't said he would block welfare cuts altogether. Withdraw eligibility for the Winter Fuel Payment and free TV Licence from pensioners on the 40% rate of income tax. A ""yellow card"" system to deal with benefit claimants breaking the rules, rather than imposing sanctions without warning.SNP: Oppose cuts to in-work benefits. Support moves to extend paternity leave. Introduce a maximum combined withdrawal rate for benefits and reforms to employment support allowance and cold weather payments. Protect policies such as concessionary travel for older Scots.Plaid Cymru: Move away from complex and expensive means testing for child-related benefits. Continue to campaign for the introduction of a living pension during the period of the next parliament for those aged 80 and over. UKIP: Only pay child benefit for the first two children for new claimants. Increase the Carers' Allowance to the same level as Jobseekers' Allowance (JSA) and pay a higher rate of JSA if you've been in work and already made tax and National Insurance contributions. Prevent anyone taking up permanent residence in Britain unless they're able to support themselves and any dependents they bring with them for at least five years and stop them receiving benefits. Stop paying child benefit for children who don't live in Britain. Scrap what UKIP calls the ""detested bedroom tax"". Boost ""credit unions"".Greens: The party backs a Citizen's Income, a fixed amount of £72 income a week to be paid to every individual, whether they are in work or not, to be funded by higher taxes on the better off and green levies.  But in the short-term it would increase the minimum wage to £10 by 2020. Ban zero hours contracts. Axe the ""bedroom tax"". Abolish the work capability assessment and restore the level of the former disability living allowance. Scrap the government's welfare cap, which limits the maximum amount a household can claim annually to £26,000 a year."

2015-04-03,Elephant trap?,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32047998,"The campaign has not even got under way, yet in the space of a couple of hours we have now been treated to not only one election pledge, but to two. The prime minister ruled out raising VAT if re-elected - while Labour said National Insurance contributions wouldn't go up.Usually politicians fudge the question of tax rises.  When he was leader of the opposition David Cameron himself said ""we have no need to raise taxes"" - before hiking up VAT after polling day.Famously, John Major said he had ""no plans"" to put up the sales tax -  before his chancellor did just that.And when he appeared in front of the cross-party Treasury committee of MPs on Tuesday, the current chancellor seemed to be continuing that tradition.  Under repeated questioning, George Osborne said: ""The policies we have do not involve a VAT rise.""That formulation appeared to give him not so much wriggle room, but an entire wriggle mansion.Labour assumed their campaign warning of further VAT rises to come under the Tories was very much on the money.But George Osborne's allies are suggesting privately that he had, in fact, been walking Ed Miliband to the edge of an elephant trap, then beckoning the prime minister to push the opposition leader in.Ed Miliband's strategists fully expected Mr Cameron to repeat the chancellor's obfuscation on tax at the final Prime Minister's Questions of this Parliament. They would then have expanded on the theme, inviting the prime minister to answer other difficult questions - then say he wasn't being straight with the British people for avoiding them.But the Labour leader was completely wrong-footed when first the prime minister said he would rule out a VAT rise and then counter-punched, inquiring if Labour would now rule out an increase in National Insurance contributions.Ed Miliband dodged the question and what could have been downbeat Conservative benches, uneasy over the prime minister's announcement this week of his retirement plans, were given something to cheer.The reason Ed Miliband didn't respond is because he was holding the National Insurance pledge back for Labour's manifesto.But that soon became unsustainable - so the other Ed, the shadow chancellor Ed Balls, had to undertake a hasty round of the TV studios to do just that.When I spoke to him mid-tour, he put on a brave face. His view was that George Osborne, having raised VAT from 17.5% to 20%, wanted to give the issue a low profile - whereas the prime minister had now made the mistake of putting it centre stage. And he believed David Cameron's promise would be judged against his past VAT-raising performance.He defended Ed Miliband's reluctance to talk about National Insurance as he felt it would have been ""inappropriate"" to announce Labour tax policy at PMQs.So the prime minister - always a better tactician than strategist - can at least satisfy himself that he smoked Labour out on NI and disrupted at least one entry in their election campaign grid.But the exchange actually raised more questions than it answered.If the main parties are ruling out further potential sources of revenue, but still committing themselves to eradicating a £90bn black hole in the public finances, will they now be under more pressure during the election campaign to spell out in much greater detail exactly what they intend to cut?"
2015-04-03,Who's next?,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32031343,"David Cameron's declaration that he will not seek a third term in office if he retains power in May has immediately stoked interest in who might fill his shoes when he's gone. Here are the likely - and perhaps less obvious - possibilities.Claim? As chancellor of the exchequer he's the man in charge of the purse strings and master strategist - and reportedly the PM's favourite to succeed him, although he hasn't said as much. Mr Cameron's right-hand man has had an image makeover of late, with a new haircut and a diet to shed some pounds. And he has seemingly recovered from his ""omnishambles"" Budget in 2012, with his latest - and last Budget - of the parliament giving the Tories a lead in some polls. He's said to be well liked among Conservative cabinet ministers and backbench MPs, whose support is vital for any candidate wanting to take on the party leadership. He shas some work to do among grassroots Tory members, however, coming fifth in ConservativeHome's latest online poll of party members on future leaders.Latest odds: 10/1 (according to William Hill)What's he said? ""The prime minister leads a strong team but what you see from him is answering a direct question with a direct answer. I think that's really refreshing. He says he's going to serve that full five years so the real question facing the country now is do you want the strong leadership of David Cameron that's delivering zero inflation and record jobs or do you want the chaos and incompetence of Ed Miliband.""Claim? The longest-serving home secretary in 50 years, she is only the second Conservative woman to secure one of the top four jobs in government. In her role, she has talked tough on immigration and crime and taken on the Police Federation. And she is popular with Tory activists, consistently occupying either first or second place in ConservativeHome's online polls on future party leaders. There have long been claims of Mrs May positioning herself for the top job, with reported tensions between her and the prime minister. Critics say she lacks charisma and micro-manages - while some cannot forget her coining the now infamous ""nasty party"" phrase at a Tory conference in 2002, but supporters say she is a formidable operator, and have dubbed her Britain's Angela Merkel. Latest odds: 9/2What's she said? ""My view is very simple, David Cameron is a first class leader of the party and a first class prime minister and I hope he is going to be doing that for a very long time."" (Desert Island discs, 23 November 2014)Claim? The blonde bombshell and mayor of London who can seemingly reach voters that others in the party cannot. Casting aside a rather chequered past he steered the capital through the 2012 Olympics, launched the successful and popular ""Boris bikes"" and got rid of London's ""bendy buses"" in favour of the new Routemaster double deckers. Mr Johnson hopes to revive his Westminster parliamentary career at the general election. He has been tipped by many to take the helm of the Conservative Party, and has not discouraged the idea. Like Theresa May, he is also a favourite among the grassroots of the party, pipping her to the top spot in ConservativeHome's latest poll of party members on future leaders. (he's ahead by 2 points). Critics say the gaffe-prone politician is not the right man for the job, but his supporters point to his wide-spread appeal.Latest odds: 9/4What's he said? ""I think what David Cameron is saying is banal and obvious. There has already been a leader of the Conservative Party for ten years and he's done an outstanding job. What he's saying now is that he wants to serve through to 2020 and that is frankly what we need him to do... five more years is what this country needs. I'm not entirely certain I see what the story is. He was asked a straight question, are you going to serve a third term like Mrs Thatcher or Tony Blair and he said no, because he thinks that ten years on top of British politics is an incredibly long time.""Claim? A self-made millionaire and devotee of Margaret Thatcher, he is regarded as one of the Conservatives' fastest-rising stars. The Treasury minister-turned-culture secretary became the first of the 2010 intake of MPs to reach cabinet level, and the first Asian male Conservative cabinet minister. He's currently polling well among the Conservative grassroots, who voted him third most preferable leader in ConservativeHome's latest online future leader poll. David Cameron recently said he wants to see a British Asian prime minister in his lifetime.Latest odds: 12/1Claim? Currently holding one of the four great offices of state - foreign secretary - Mr Hammond's name has often cropped up whenever talk of leadership contenders has emerged. He has built up an impressive CV in government since the Conservatives came to power in 2010, being first awarded the job of transport secretary before his promotion to defence secretary where he stayed for three years. He's regarded by many commentators as being a potential candidate for the Tory right. He seems to have work to do among party activists, scoring only 4% in ConservativeHome's future leader poll.Latest odds: 12/1"
2015-04-03,Cereal number,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-magazine-monitor-31962592,"David Cameron has declared he won't seek a third term as prime minister, citing an advertising slogan for Shredded Wheat used in the UK more than 30 years ago. What's its enduring power, asks Justin Parkinson.The hotel kitchen staff are in disbelief. Someone in room 147 has ordered three Shredded Wheat. The maid transports them upstairs to find England cricketer Ian Botham waiting at a table, dressed in full whites.The maid leaves. Botham hides one of the Shredded Wheat under a napkin and winks to camera. Cue music, as the slogan ""Shredded Wheat. Bet you can't eat three"" appears.This advert and others featuring football manager Brian Clough and the actor Richard Kiel, who played Jaws in James Bond films, have not run for some time. Nestle, which owns the brand, says the last probably aired in 1984.But their message seems to have waned little. Telling the BBC he would only serve a limited time in Downing Street, David Cameron said: ""Terms are like Shredded Wheat - two are wonderful but three might just be too many.""The prime minister's reprise was unlikely to be accidental, says Thayne Forbes, joint managing director of the brand-valuation company Intangible Business. ""Everybody would empathise with the view that three Shredded Wheat would probably be too much,"" he says. ""The slogan suggests people shouldn't overdo it. It sounds modest and reasoned.""As marketing goes, it might seem counter-intuitive, as it discourages excessive consumption. But it also sounds honest and unexploitative.Other advertising slogans and themes are in wide use in public and political discourse. Examples include Marmite being a by-word for divisiveness - a ""Marmite person"" is either loved or hated. Cameron has twice referred to Ronseal - the woodcare product that does ""exactly what it says on the tin"". But Shredded Wheat, its best-known slogan having lain dormant for so long, appears to be used less often. The cereal, created in the US in the 1890s, has long been sold as good for the evolving British lifestyle. A newspaper advert in 1902 described it as ""a relief from the monotony of everlasting porridge"", while, by 1943, it was ""an ideal food for all war workers"". The 1980s saw an emphasis on ""simple, honest goodness"", while, in the 2000s, its long heritage and reliability was promoted.""It's a good association for Cameron,"" says Forbes. ""He must have been brought up on it, like lots of other people. It will be great marketing for Shredded Wheat to have the slogan used after so many years, too.""Subscribe to the BBC News Magazine's email newsletter to get articles sent to your inbox"
2015-04-03,Are you 'cosmopolitan'?,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32021853,"The rise of UKIP heralds the emergence of a new divide in British politics, with cosmopolitan voters on one side and non-cosmopolitan ones on the other, argues Jeremy Cliffe.We hear a lot about UKIP these days. The party stole the show at the local and European elections last year, then again in the autumn when it lured two Conservative MPs to defect.  In the past weeks alone there have been three much-discussed television programmes about the party: ""Meet the Ukippers"", ""Farage Fans and UKIP Lovers"" and ""100 Days of UKIP"". At the upcoming general election the party will probably increase its share of seats in Westminster - and will certainly affect the results in dozens of other constituencies by taking votes from the other parties. But ask some of those academics who have been watching UKIP's rise, and they will tell you that it is just one part of a bigger story. We are all used to the left-right divide in politics: a spectrum of different views on how much the government should tax, spend, regulate and otherwise intervene in the economy. But according to Dr Rob Ford of Manchester University, UKIP exists on a different axis, one to do with cultural rather than economic matters. This new political scale is ever more prominent in British political life.Radio 4's Analysis programmeOn the one end of it is what you might call a ""cosmopolitan"" philosophy: a relaxed, liberal attitude to issues concerning national identity (like immigration) and to questions of morality and lifestyle (like gay marriage). On the other end is a ""non-cosmopolitan"" outlook: more nationalist, socially conservative and less comfortable with social change, or in other words the ideological stance often associated with typical UKIP voters. This divide cuts across the left-right scale: there are cosmopolitan and non-cosmopolitan voters in both the Conservative and the Labour camps, which is why UKIP takes support from both.Lots of things are making this cosmopolitanism divide more important. One is that the old class-based, ideological conflict between left and right has declined. Dr James Tilley of Oxford University argues that politicians are partly to blame. The economic philosophies of the Conservative and Labour parties are so similar, he argues, that other, cultural issues are becoming more important. Another factor is the growing gap between the generations: the difference in outlook between the cosmopolitan young and less cosmopolitan, older voters is greater than it was in the past (partly due to the recent rise in levels of university education, which tend to correlate with liberal views). This trend presents the established parties with some difficult questions. As Dr Ford puts it, they ""have to try and deal with this rising value divide, particularly now that UKIP has mobilised it into the political debate."" ""They have to make a move,"" he adds, ""but any move that they make risks making their position worse with one or the other of these groups of voters."" Sound too cosmopolitan, and the parties risk losing supporters to UKIP. Try to ""out-UKIP UKIP"", and they could alienate their younger, more socially liberal supporters. So both are doing the political splits, trying to reconcile the cosmopolitans within their ranks with the non-cosmopolitans. Witness the tortuous attempts by Ed Miliband to sound tough on immigration without sounding too tough. Witness, too, the recent struggles of David Cameron to persuade social conservatives in his party that gay marriage can be an innately conservative institution. In the long-term, this divide will become less problematic. That is because over the years the country will tilt towards the cosmopolitan end of this new spectrum. So says Penny Young of NatCen, the research organisation that conducts the extensive British Social Attitudes survey. Various demographic factors explain this trend. The country as a whole is becoming more accepting of same-sex relationships. Younger voters are more relaxed about things like immigration and national identity than were previous generations when they were young, suggesting that the overall population will tilt in an internationalist direction over time. And ever more parts of the country are acquiring the ethnic and social diversity once confined to the inner cities, a trend that generally makes people more comfortable with immigration. According to Dr Ford the question is therefore: how should the main political parties navigate this period of transition? It would be wrong to simply abandon the swathes of voters at the less cosmopolitan end of the scale; voters who are usually older and more isolated than the average member of the population.Yet the politicians do need to adapt to the changing attitudes of British society and be honest with voters rather than pandering to views that, deep down, they do not share. This quandary may not decide the upcoming general election, but in the established parties savvy strategists with an eye to elections in 2020 and beyond are grappling with it nonetheless. That is a wise move."
2015-04-03,Dudley debate,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32015334,"I met Afzal Amin for the first time on Friday, but I already knew who he was. In Dudley North, the seat he was selected by the Conservatives to fight in the general election, Mr Amin had become hard to avoid. When I first looked at the local newspaper online, the pages were surrounded by ""Amin"" logos in the preferred Tory shade of blue.Not long after we met, he asked me to pose for a photo, snapped by one of his campaign team, and doubtless rapidly tweeted out to followers of the would-be MP.Perhaps no surprise that the man running such a disciplined operation has served in the army and been to Sandhurst. That was very much the message he delivered on Friday, as he addressed school and college pupils at a hustings in Dudley which I'd been invited to chair.There was combative debate, too, not least with his Labour rival, the MP Ian Austin. Both men knew the Dudley contest was critical for their respective parties; Ian Austin held the seat by just over 600 votes in 2010. Just as David Cameron was denied a majority by failing to take seats like this one, so Ed Miliband is unlikely to be in No 10 if Labour loses Dudley North.He was self-confident and fluent. The only obvious mis-step came right at the end, when he interrupted Vicky Duckworth, the Green candidate for the neighbouring seat. She expressed the opinion that politics often seemed to be about men shouting at each other; Mr Amin complained she was engaging in gender bias.A few weeks ago, one Conservative MP who knows him well and respects his talents, said Afzal Amin had warned him of the risks of over-confidence. He thought he risked running before he could walk.Well, he stumbled badly this weekend. Whatever the purpose of his contacts with the English Defence League - and he strongly disputes claims that he wanted them to hold a protest that would then be called off, for which he could then take the credit - the exposure has damaged him and, potentially, the prospects of his party re-taking the seat.In February, the EDL staged a rally against plans for a new mosque in the town. As the Mail on Sunday story makes clear, Afzal Amin pleaded with them beforehand not to hold that demonstration; but it went ahead anyway. It's what happened subsequently which will feature in Tuesday's disciplinary hearing.Over the weekend, I put his defence to a very senior Conservative source - that this was an attempt to broker a compromise in order to bring together a divided community. The arch response: Dudley isn't Kandahar.Nor do I think from my visits to the town, where I'm going to be based for the general election, will people in Dudley appreciate being painted as somewhere riven by racial discord.True, Dudley was the scene of one of England's earliest race riots. But that was in 1962. Although the controversy over replacing the mosque - currently in a converted school and inadequate for the numbers who want to worship there - has been running for a decade, community relations are generally good. Even those who don't want a new mosque didn't want the EDL protestors - nor to be fair the anti-fascist counter-demonstrators who followed them.As for the Conservative Party, the view of the national leadership is that you don't collaborate with the EDL. Not least because the Tories are still struggling to bury some historic baggage in the Black Country: Enoch Powell was an MP in Wolverhampton when he delivered his Rivers of Blood speech about immigration in 1968.Four years before that, there was the notorious election in Smethwick which the Conservatives were accused of winning by wooing white voters with an offensive rhyme suggesting who'd they'd get as a neighbour if they voted Labour. Afzal Amin grew up in Smethwick so he should be aware of that history. He was, until his suspension on Saturday, one of about 17% of Conservative parliamentary candidates who are not white. The party is proud of that, but it's still struggling to translate that into votes.Afzal Amin may believe that he can persuade the party to lift the suspension when he meets party officials on Tuesday. I have my doubts. Even if they accept his defence, will the other parties be so charitable? The allegations would follow him on the campaign trail, and make planned visits by cabinet ministers next to impossible.On Friday, just before the hustings in Dudley began, Afzal Amin gave me his business card. It introduces him as 'prospective member of Parliament Dudley North'. I think I'll keep it; it could yet become a collector's item."

2015-04-04,Bid to change Speaker election rules,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32061097,"A last-minute bid to change the way the Speaker of the House of Commons is elected is to be debated by MPs.Labour criticised the government motion, to be debated on the final day before the dissolution of Parliament, saying the Conservatives were ""trying to play politics with the speakership"".Under the proposals, a secret ballot would decide whether there should be a contested election for the post.MPs currently have to file through the division lobbies to cast their vote.This means it is clear who does or does not back the incumbent as Speaker.Labour's shadow leader of the Commons Angela Eagle raised the party's concerns in the House on Wednesday evening, questioning whether the motion was within parliamentary rules.Current Speaker John Bercow is - technically - one of them, but many Tory MPs have never liked him.They resent his personal style and some believe he is far from impartial in the way he conducts business in the Commons.Attempts by some to force a vote on his resumption as Speaker in 2010 came to nothing. There have been the occasional measured jibes at him from the prime minister. Other Tories reportedly went much further and formed a group whose members had all been reprimanded by him. But the Speaker is a reformer who believes passionately that the people who elect the members, and pay the bills, should come first.The last act of the coalition looks like being an attempt to unseat him. And they are very serious about it.One Tory MP fighting an important marginal seat had been cleared by his party to be away from Parliament but he is now staying for the vote, such is the importance of it.She told Deputy Speaker Lindsay Hoyle: ""It's just come to my attention that the government has tabled a motion for debate on the final day of this Parliament, with no notice whatsoever to myself as shadow leader of the House, proposing changes to the way in which the Speaker of this House is elected.""Procedural matters in this House, with no consultation with the opposition, no consultation with the chair of the committee itself, for debate in only one hour tomorrow.""Mr Hoyle said the motion had been ""rightly or wrongly"" agreed to on Tuesday, saying that ""business of the House is decided by the government, not by the chair.""A spokesman for Commons Leader William Hague said the motion had been tabled as a free hour had opened up in Thursday's business after the House of Lords approved the Modern Slavery Bill.The proposed change would apply when a Speaker wishes to continue in the post after a general election.Under the current rules, if the Speaker's re-appointment is objected to, a division is held, with MPs choosing to back or oppose the Speaker in the division lobbies.The replacement of this method with a secret ballot was suggested in 2010 by a committee of MPs, which said the public method ""can be seen as a deterrent to the House expressing its views honestly"".MPs will now debate whether this change should be made."

2015-04-04,MPs warn on growth of UK jihadists,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32059813,"Not enough is being done to prevent people leaving the UK to join Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, a group of MPs has warned.Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said Britain must win their ""hearts and minds"".The committee's report comes as the BBC launches a database tracking British jihadists in Syria and Iraq. It shows that many people left in clusters from certain UK areas - often due to friendships and peer groups. The MPs' report argued that preventative work with communities, families and international partners was ""vital"" and needs to be a top priority for the Home Office.  ""The number of cases being brought to public attention should ring alarm bells,"" said Labour MP Mr Vaz.  ""This must be a relentless battle for hearts and minds, and without a strong counter-narrative we are in danger of failing to prevent even more departures. We are at the edge of a cliff."" The BBC has been tracking the stories of the men, women, boys and girls who have gone to Syria and Iraq to understand why they go, where they go from and what happens to them. By analysing around 160 profiles, it reveals the way in which people have travelled in clusters - a group of three young friends from Coventry, another group from Portsmouth, drawn out by one person they knew, others in Cardiff linked to people involved in an extremist organisation. Social media might play a part but face-to-face contact appears just as, if not more, important, according to the database.It includes the stories of: The BBC research emphasises the extent to which real-world contacts, rather than just online connections, are often a key driver of radicalisation and intent to travel to Iraq and Syria. Some of the experts who appeared before the Home Affairs Committee also argued the internet was a secondary influence. They said that universities and prisons were among the two most significant places where radicalisation occurred. A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police, which was not aware of the report, said it would have ""welcomed the opportunity"" to have given evidence to the committee and that it planned to look at the report in detail.The disappearance of schoolgirls Shamima Begum, Amira Abase, both 15, and Kadiza Sultana, 16, from east London in February, raised questions as to who could have done more to prevent their departure. After taking evidence from the police and the families of the girls among others, Mr Vaz said their case suffered from a ""lack of immediate action"". He added: ""Schools and the police must inform parents immediately, and work with them even if there is the smallest hint of radicalisation, or a close association with someone who is thought to have been radicalised.""However, the Met Police spokesman defended the speed of the police response to the schoolgirls' disappearance.  He said the committee's criticism was ""misleading"", pointing to the evidence given by both UK and Turkish authorities of ""rapid exchanges"" between the two.The committee's report said there needed to be an advice service which would be a less extreme step than calling the anti-terrorist hotline.The Association of Chief Police Officer's lead officer for the government's anti-terror strategy Prevent, Chief Constable Sir Peter Fahy, agreed that more needed to be done.However, he said the police ""do not have the capacity"" to routinely work with every school in the country.He added: ""The police service will play its part but the prime responsibility for dissuading young people from getting involved in extremist activity has to lie with parents, families and carers.""The committee also pointed to weaknesses in information sharing with airlines and other countries. It said greater care needed to be taken at airport check-in desks when people were travelling to destinations of concern - namely Syria, Somalia, Iraq and Nigeria, as well as neighbouring countries, such as Turkey. The report said police also needed to work faster to alert overseas partners and airlines when there were concerns over individuals.There were signs that some of the girls had followed extremist accounts on social media, the report said.The committee said that social media companies, such as Facebook and Twitter, should be prepared to suspend accounts when there is evidence they are being used to promote violent extremism.  The report also said it was disappointed the Home Office had not implemented a programme for individuals returning to Britain where there is evidence they had fought in Syria.Security officials estimate that some 600 Britons have left the country to join IS - and while around half may have returned, many are still out there - and some have died.  The BBC project includes detailed profiles of individuals which can be searched, based on hometown, age and gender, as well as those who have been convicted in the courts or who are believed to have been killed."

If not, the prince's private letters will either remain confidential, as the sender intended, or they'll be exposed to a large and inquisitive audience.

That will be a clear pledge from us.""He accused Mr Cameron of making an ""out of the blue, panicky"" announcement on VAT that ""no one in Britain will believe"".Labour, which has already announced plans to increase the top rate of income tax and impose a new ""mansion tax"" on high value properties, insists its plans are fully costed and will not require additional tax hikes if it wins May's general election.Mr Miliband began his final head-to-head encounter with Mr Cameron before the election by joking that the PM had ""announced his retirement plans"" - a reference to a BBC interview in which the prime minister said he would not serve a third term if the Tories remained in power.Challenging Mr Cameron to give a ""straight answer to a straight question"", Mr Miliband pressed him on whether he would rule out a rise in VAT after the election, as Labour had done.In response, the prime minister immediately said ""yes"", prompting loud cheers in turn from the Conservative benches. He contrasted what he said was a ""clear promise"" with Labour's unwillingness to rule out a rise in National Insurance.""I answered a very simple question about VAT. I ruled out an increase... straight answer to him, straight question from me. I have ruled out VAT. Will he rule out national insurance contributions. Yes or no?"" Mr Cameron added: ""We all know this is Labour's job tax. This is their tax of choice. This is what they clobber working people, families and enterprises with.""But Mr Miliband responded by saying there was ""only one person who is going to raise taxes on working families and that is him"".He said nobody would believe Mr Cameron on VAT ""because of his extreme spending plans, because his numbers do not add up and because he promised it last time and broke his promise"".Mr Cameron, he added, had broken other promises made before the last election to reduce annual net migration below 100,000 and not to pursue a major structural re-organisation of the NHS, adding that it was ""time for a better plan and time for a Labour government"".But Mr Cameron suggested a future Labour government would result in the ""chaos of economic crisis"", with Ed Miliband being ""held hostage"" by the SNP.The packed session provided a last opportunity for the two men to rally their MPs and set out their arguments before the start of the election campaign next week.Speaking after the exchanges and the other parties' tax pledges, deputy prime minister Nick Clegg said the Lib Dems ""don't need to raise VAT, national insurance or headline rates of income tax or corporation tax either"".""There are other taxes and other tax loopholes that we can increase or close in order to balance the books,"" he said.

2015-04-04,Met police 'had files on MPs in 90s',https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32044580,"A former undercover police officer has told BBC News that Scotland Yard kept intelligence files on MPs during the 1990s. Ex-Special Branch officer Peter Francis says he saw files on 10 Labour MPs which he and others regularly updated. He says he personally gathered information on three MPs as part of his work infiltrating left-wing groups. The MPs named, and Labour, have called for a forthcoming public inquiry into undercover policing to be widened. Mr Francis operated undercover between 1993 and 1997 in the Met's now disbanded Special Demonstration Squad. He was told to embed himself in left-wing groups or causes that were deemed to pose a potential threat to security. He says that during this period he was told to gather intelligence on MPs and their activities if and when they featured in any of his operations. That information, he says, was added to a special pink file that was available for Special Branch officers to read. Between 1990 and 2001, he claims to have personally seen records relating to Diane Abbott, the late Tony Benn, Jeremy Corbyn, the late Bernie Grant, Peter Hain, Harriet Harman, Ken Livingstone, Joan Ruddock, Dennis Skinner and Jack Straw.Four of the group became ministers during Mr Francis's time in Special Branch - including Jack Straw who was home secretary after 1997. ""When I was deployed undercover in the Special Demonstration Squad, any MP that I came across, such as on demonstrations, I would report back on them,"" he said. Mr Francis says that the files not only contained the MPs' publicly-stated political views - but also intelligence on what was going on behind the scenes in the party or their group. He says some of the information would have been things said in private by the MP, depending on how close each undercover officer had been able to get. Mr Francis said that when he first saw the files he understood that each had probably been created before the individual was an MP because of their personal involvement in radical causes or protests.But he added: ""When they became MPs these files carried on. It [was] your duty as an SDS officer to report back any intelligence that you come across. ""I felt that it was OK to report back on MPs,"" he said. ""I used to give myself a pat on the back, thinking 'I have done a good job'. These MPs were spied on and they should know.""""I don't think the police force should be monitoring MPs, full stop. I don't think we have any right to do that at all. It may be justifiable to say that the Security Service should be doing it - but I certainly don't think the police should be doing it.""Scotland Yard has refused to comment on the substance of the claims, but a spokesman said it had not shied away from serious allegations about the SDS. It said that Operation Herne, the internal police investigation into what happened in the unit, remained an ongoing investigation.""Operation Herne maintains that without speaking to Peter Francis it is simply not possible to fully investigate allegations he makes,"" said a spokesman. ""Operation Herne remains very willing to engage with him.""Mr Francis said that he has refused to speak to Operation Herne because he fears being interviewed under caution as a suspect, rather than a whistleblower. Scotland Yard told the BBC that Operation Herne detectives would be prepared to speak to him as a witness. He has, however, spoken to Mark Ellison QC who reviewed allegations about the SDS for the Home Secretary Theresa May - prompting her to launch a statutory inquiry. He says he will appear before those hearings. Peter Hain, who was a leader of the anti-apartheid movement in the late 1960s and 70s and became an MP in 1991, said he now wants full answers from Scotland Yard. ""I was deeply disturbed to find that files were still being kept by the Special Branch while I and others were serving Members of Parliament,"" he said. ""That is constitutionally an outrage. It infringes the sovereignty of Parliament. ""I want to see the home secretary widen the scope of the inquiry into the SDS to look specifically at the surveillance of MPs and the fact that there were active files on us while we were serving Members of Parliament. ""This should never have happened and it should have been reported and properly authorised - and we don't know whether it was.""Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper echoed the call for the inquiry to be widened in light of what she described as ""extremely serious and disturbing allegations"".""While undercover policing remains a crucial tool in combating serious and organised crime it must not be abused,"" she said.""There have now been a series of serious allegations about undercover policing - ranging from the treatment of Stephen Lawrence's family to police having long-term inappropriate relationships. ""We called some time ago for much stronger oversight of undercover policing and it is also vital to get to the truth about what has happened."" Mrs May announced earlier this month that Lord Justice Pitchford would lead the inquiry into the SDS allegations - but the precise shape of that inquiry is not yet clear.A Home Office spokesman said the review by Mark Ellison QC had unearthed ""serious historical failings"". ""That is why the Home Secretary established a public inquiry to thoroughly investigate undercover policing and the operation of the Special Demonstration Squad. ""Lord Justice Pitchford will consult interested parties to the inquiry over the coming months on setting the terms of reference, with a view to publishing these at the end of July.""Undercover policing is an essential tactic in the fight against crime but to improve the public's confidence in undercover work we must ensure there is no repeat of these failings in the future."""
2015-04-04,NHS problems worst 'since 1990s',https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/health-32057948,"Services in the NHS in England are deteriorating in a way not seen since the early 1990s, according to a leading health think tank. The King's Fund review said waiting times for A&E, cancer care and routine operations had all started getting worse, while deficits were growing.It said such drops in performance had not been seen for 20 years.But the think tank acknowledged the NHS had done as well as could be expected, given the financial climate.Professor John Appleby, chief economist at the King's Fund, which specialises in health care policy, said: ""The next government will inherit a health service that has run out of money and is operating at the very edge of its limits. ""There is now a real risk that patient care will deteriorate as service and financial pressures become overwhelming.""He said in terms of how standards were slipping - not how low they had reached - the situation was the worst it had been since the ""early 1990s"".The report noted much of the deterioration has happened in the second-half of the Parliament with many measures of performance being maintained in the first few years.It said the next government had to address the funding situation, adding the extra £8bn a year NHS England says is needed by 2020, was the ""minimum"" that would be required.The report - a review of performance this Parliament - highlights a range of problems as well as achievements. These include:The report is the second part of the King's Fund pre-election review of the NHS this Parliament.Last month it warned the coalition government's reforms of the health service had been ""damaging and distracting"".The King's Fund report should make worrying reading. The reference to the 1990s conjures up images of - for the NHS at least - a bygone era. The think tank's point was not that waiting times had reached the level they were at then, rather that this is the first time in two decades of almost continuous improvement that there has been a sustained drop in performance.In many ways, that had to happen. Services cannot keep getting better for ever. Nonetheless, the findings are crystal clear: the NHS is at a critical juncture. But what is less easy to determine is to what extent the coalition's policies have contributed to the difficulties.The think tank has already provided a critical analysis of the government's reforms - and when pushed, acknowledged the health service may have been ""in better shape"" if they had not happened.But the more significant issue for the health of the health service this Parliament has been the squeeze on finances. Even though the budget has been increased, it has felt more like a cut to many because demands have risen so quickly.On this though, the King's Fund accepted that the government's hands were tied. Given the state of the economy, ministers did as much as they could have.Read more from NickRoyal College of Nursing general secretary Peter Carter said politicians needed to take note of the warnings made by the King's Fund.""Morale is low, and more and more staff are being made sick with stress because of the intolerable pressure they are under,"" he added. Katherine Murphy, of the Patients Association, said: ""The findings echo what we are hearing on a daily basis on our helpline. It is clear to the public that the future of the NHS is one of the most important issues facing the nation and it should be a central issue in the election campaign.""Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham said: ""Five years ago David Cameron stood on a promise to protect the NHS. This report provides authoritative proof that he has broken that promise.""But a Department of Health spokesman said: ""As the King's Fund says, the NHS has 'performed well in the face of huge challenges', but if we are to continue to invest in the NHS going forward it needs to be backed by a strong economy.""

2015-04-04,SNP 'could block Tory government',https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32045419,"The SNP would block a minority Conservative government by voting down its Queen's Speech if it holds the post-election balance of power, its former leader Alex Salmond has said.Mr Salmond said the move could bring down the government if Labour joined in, with David Cameron ""locked out"".The Conservatives accused him of ""trying to sabotage the democratic will of the British people"".Labour has called his balance of power prediction ""bluster and bluff"".In recent days Mr Salmond, who is bidding to become a Westminster MP at the 7 May general election, has claimed his party could ""hold the power"" in a hung Parliament and would be able to influence the Budget of a minority Labour government.This was dismissed by Labour leader Ed Miliband, who has ruled out a formal coalition with the Scottish nationalists.The SNP currently has six MPs at Westminster, but recent opinion polls suggest its share could increase dramatically at the general election.James Cook, BBC News Scotland correspondentIf the Conservatives attempt to form a minority government and enough MPs vote against their Queen's Speech the administration would fall at the first hurdle and the leader of the opposition would have a shot at forming a government.That's how parliamentary democracy works in the event of a hung Parliament.And yet the Conservatives are saying that by planning to vote against a government he opposes Alex Salmond has ""confirmed he would sabotage the democratic will of the British people in order to make Ed Miliband prime minister"".It is part of their continuing attempt to portray Mr Miliband as a weak leader whose strings are being pulled by Mr Salmond.This kind of language causes despair among Tories north of the border who fear that the party in London is waltzing into an SNP trap.They know that many voters in Scotland will read the phrase ""democratic will of the British people"" and hear ""democratic will of the English people"".Because, if it is illegitimate for Scottish MPs, from whatever party, to vote against one government and support another in the British parliament, then what, voters may ask, is the point of the union?Who is dancing to Mr Salmond's tune now?Mr Salmond, the former Scottish first minister, told the New Statesman that in the event of a hung Parliament, a minority Conservative government would have to ""go straight effectively for a vote of confidence - usually the Queen's Speech, although it could be otherwise, of course - and we'd be voting against.""If David Cameron lost this vote, he said, there would be a two-week period for another government to be formed.BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said Mr Salmond had ""hardened his anti-Conservative rhetoric"" in the interview.A Conservative spokesman said:  ""Alex Salmond has confirmed he would sabotage the democratic will of the British people in order to make Ed Miliband prime minister. ""That would mean chaos for Britain, with weak Ed Miliband dancing to Alex Salmond's tune.""He said the ""only way to keep Britain together"" was to vote Conservative.Mr Salmond's latest comments come after Mr Miliband said the only people writing a future Labour Budget would be himself and shadow chancellor Ed Balls.Speaking in Clydebank on Monday, he added: ""It's not going to be Alex Salmond - not in a million years."""
2015-04-04,MPs criticise 'lack of EU debate',https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32045290,"The government's ""failure"" to let MPs debate EU legislation is ""deplorable"", a Parliamentary committee says.The European Scrutiny Committee said ministers had refused to schedule debates on issues such as free movement and the EU's Budget.It also said BBC coverage of EU matters should be ""improved substantially"".The government said the number of EU debates had doubled since 2009-10, while the BBC said its coverage was ""extensive and impartial"".The cross-party committee's role includes scrutinising EU documents and recommending the most important for debate in the House of Commons.Its report said in the period covering most of the 2014-15 financial year there were three debates on the floor of the House, compared with 12 in 2013-14.It also pointed out that not a single debate had taken place during a nine-month period, between 9 June 2014 and 9 March 2015.""The government's collective failure to schedule so many debates on EU documents over the past year is deplorable, and is a discourtesy to this committee and to all members of the House,"" the MPs said.Prime Minister David Cameron has sought to rally support from other EU leaders for his plans to curb welfare payments to European migrants ahead of a referendum on the UK's membership if he wins the general election.The committee said the government's ""cavalier"" approach was ""at odds with UK ministers' claims in their speeches across the EU about the role of national parliaments"".The Foreign Office said the government was committed to a ""strong EU scrutiny system that enables Parliament to hold it to account for the decisions taken in Brussels"".It added: ""We have made good on our commitment to raise standards by doubling the number of Europe debates on the floor of the House since 2009-10.""This government has also increased by around a fifth since 2010 the number of EU proposals that have been scrutinised and cleared by Parliament before being agreed in Brussels.""The committee has also been examining the BBC's coverage of European issues, taking evidence from director general Lord Hall and head of news James Harding earlier this month.During that appearance, Lord Hall said the desire for balanced output ""ran deep"" within the BBC and he believed that this was being achieved.Mr Harding said if the public was going to trust the BBC to report on politicians impartially it had to be clear that BBC journalists weren't ""asked by politicians to come and account for what they do and in effect do the bidding of those politicians"".But the committee said it was ""concerned about the manner in which the BBC treats EU issues"", calling for coverage to be ""improved substantially"".It suggested coverage did not reflect all sides of the debate on the European Union, and more analysis was needed. Its chairman, Conservative MP Sir William Cash, said the BBC had ""very particular obligations"" to be impartial and to ""educate and inform"".He added:  ""We do not believe this is currently being achieved in the context of the BBC's EU coverage.""A BBC spokesman said the corporation provided extensive and impartial coverage of European and Parliamentary issues, and it would be a breach of the corporation's independence if a committee of MPs instructed the BBC on its coverage."
2015-04-04,Lobbyists must 'conform' with rules,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32047992,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe woman in charge of the government's new register of lobbyists has said she expects the industry to ""conform"" with the statutory system. Speaking ahead of the register's launch, Alison White conceded a lot of lobbyists would not be listed on it.But she said her job was to make sure the rules were implemented and she would do so with ""extreme verve and vigour.""But one critic of the register said it was ""fake"" and full of ""loopholes"".Lobbyists are companies or individuals paid to influence government decisions.The coalition promised to introduce a statutory register of lobbyists when it came to power in 2010, and legislation was passed last year, with ministers saying the move would help clean up politics.However, the new register will only cover consultant lobbyists and will not apply to lobbyists working ""in-house"" for companies or organisations.A person or company will only need to be registered if they are contacting a government minister or permanent secretary in a government department - leading to criticism it will not come close to reflecting the scale or nature of lobbying that goes on across Whitehall.But Ms White, who is independent of the government, said her task was to implement the law as it stood not to question the powers she had been given. ""We are having something that has never been in place before,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""This is a statutory register. The industry tells me it is a professional industry. I expect them to conform with the legislation. It is my job to make sure they do so.""Ms White, who was appointed as the registrar of consultant lobbyists in September, acknowledged the register would not indicate different ""levels of lobbying"".""The legislation was quite narrowly drafted to address a particular issue, which was that it was not always particularly clear, when ministers were being lobbied, who the client of the lobbyist was. That is what the register was set up to do,"" she said.She added: ""This will give anyone who wishes to access the register the opportunity to be able to see who is lobbying and being paid for it and who their clients are. That is the main information the register will contain.""If a lobbyist sets out to influence government policy in some way, they would have to be registered. If they are not registered, then they would not be conforming. They have to go on the register before they lobby.""Ms White said last month that the register would not have any entries on its launch day but she had received more than ""20 expressions of interest"" about joining and companies and individuals might be required to sign up retrospectively.Potential registrants will be able to log on and create an account to file an ""information return"".But Tamasin Cave, from the Alliance for Lobbying Transparency coalition, said ""hardly anyone"" in the industry would be covered by the provisions of the new law. ""You have a huge commercial lobbying industry, and very few of them will have to sign up,"" she told Today.""The second flaw is that it won't show the interaction between lobbyists and government, and that is what a register is for.""It is to show the activity - who is discussing what with whom, but this shows nothing of this interaction. It is a fake register."""
2015-04-04,Car smoking ban MSP welcomes backing,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-south-scotland-32055226,"The Liberal Democrat MSP behind a bill to ban smoking in cars when children are present has welcomed the support of the Scottish government.South of Scotland MSP Jim Hume launched the members' bill in December.The government said it was ""very supportive"" of the principles of the bill, but changes could be needed to make it ""workable"".Motorists could potentially be fined £100 for breaching the rule if it becomes law.Mr Hume lodged draft proposals for a bill last May calling for a ban in Scotland on smoking in private vehicles when children under 18 were present.He said he was ""over the moon"" at the news the Scottish government would endorse the Smoking Prohibition (Children in Motor Vehicles) (Scotland) Bill.He said: ""With cross-party support and the support of many third sector organisations, there is every chance that this could be in place in the next year.""Eighty-four per cent of the 160 responses to my consultation were positive and people from across Scotland have expressed their support for the move.""The bill is about guaranteeing that children in Scotland can have the freedom to go on and lead healthy lives if they choose to.""I look forward to working with MSPs from all parties as the bill progresses.""Public Health Minister Maureen Watt said the Scottish government had considered including the measure in its Public Health Bill, but instead decided to support Mr Hume's proposals.She said: ""As with any bill, as it goes through the scrutiny process, there may be amendments and improvements to strengthen the legislation and ensure it is fit for purpose. ""But we believe that the underpinning principles are strong, and that is why I am pleased to support it.""Scottish Labour and a wide range of health organisations have backed his proposals.But the Scottish Conservatives have reservations about how the bill would work in practice.The party's health spokesman Jackson Carlaw said: ""While Scottish Conservatives support any moves which would protect young people from hazardous second hand smoke we have concerns as to how this would be enforced.""It would be a better use of resources to conduct a public awareness campaign similar to that which is being proposed by the government in Wales.""We will be watching this campaign in order to ascertain what lessons may be learned and what approaches may be adopted in Scotland.""Anti-smoking campaigners welcomed the Scottish government's backing for Mr Hume's bill.ASH Scotland's chief executive Sheila Duffy said: ""It is another public health initiative that can help Scotland move forward with its ambition to achieve a tobacco-free generation in 20 years' time.""It is popular with the public and will bring Scotland into line with upcoming legislation in England and Wales.""We believe it can be effectively enforced and that having the legislation focus on cars with children bypasses concerns over interference in people's private lives.""Jim Hume must be congratulated for taking the initiative on this proposal and for all the hard work he and his team have done to bring this important measure forward.""But Simon Clark, director of the smokers' group Forest, said the bill was ""legislation for legislation's sake"".He said: ""Smoking in cars carrying children is inconsiderate. The overwhelming majority of smokers know that and don't do it.""The very small number that do will carry on regardless because the law will be difficult, if not impossible, to enforce.""Education has to be better than legislation but the government prefers gesture politics and the big stick."""
2015-04-04,Candidate quits over UKIP MEP remark,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32038485,"A UKIP election candidate has quit the party over comments made by the party's only Scottish MEP about a Scottish government minister.Tim Wilson has decided not to stand in South Northamptonshire after David Coburn MEP compared Humza Yousaf to convicted terrorist Abu Hamza.Mr Coburn has apologised for the remarks, saying it was a ""joke"".A spokesman for UKIP said Mr Wilson had failed to emphasise local issues in his general election campaign.UKIP leader Nigel Farage said Mr Coburn's remarks were a ""joke in poor taste"" but he would not be taking any action against him.But Mr Wilson said he was disillusioned with the party over the ""racist jibes"" and has decided to stand down.He told BBC Scotland he was appalled by Mr Coburn's comments about Mr Yousaf and frustrated by the inaction of the party's leadership on the issue.  He said David Coburn had produced ""what I can only describe as an Islamaphobic insult, and that's simply not acceptable"".  Mr Wilson added: ""Of course he went on and apologised.  I think, frankly, that if you are in a position of power you have to be able to control what ideas emerge from your head and how they get to your mouth and, in fact, you shouldn't have those ideas in the first place.  ""But the real issue is that when Mr Farage was asked what he thought about this he dismissed this as a joke.  ""I don't think this is a joke. I think this is something very serious.  It may not be that this man intended to cause offence but we aren't interested in what his intentions are.  We are interested in the effect what he says has on other people and the effect is catastrophic, it's appalling and I've resigned.""In his resignation letter, Mr Wilson said he had been ""systematically gagged by the party whip"" and forbidden to speak about Islam favourably. A spokesman for UKIP said Mr Wilson had failed to put more emphasis on local issues in his campaign.He said: ""Whilst we had initially been optimistic about Tim Wilson's abilities as a candidate, it became obvious in recent weeks that he was out of his depth in representing our party in the way we would expect. ""Mr Wilson had clearly misunderstood the expectations that UKIP place on all of its candidates. Principal amongst those is focusing on issues that are relevant to local voters. UKIP put huge emphasis on local issues and Mr Wilson was unwilling to follow UKIP guidelines in this respect.""Last week MSPs at the Scottish Parliament unanimously condemned the remarks made by Mr Coburn during a newspaper interview.MSPs were debating a motion celebrating Scotland's diverse communities.The president of the European Parliament, Martin Schulz, condemned the remarks, saying they were ""not worthy of any elected member"". But a spokesman for the president said he could not act on remarks made outside parliament.The move comes just days after another candidate, Jonathan Stanley, quit in protest at the ""racist filth"" in UKIP. Mr Stanley, who was due to stand in the Cumbrian seat of Westmorland and Lonsdale, was the party's former head of policy in Scotland."

2015-04-04,Manifesto watch,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-29642613,"Political parties are putting together their manifestos for May's general election. Here's a guide to where they currently stand on the issues voters say they care about most (according to pollsters IPSOS Mori).ImmigrationConservatives:  David Cameron wants to make migrants wait four years before they can claim certain benefits, such as tax credits, Universal Credit, or get access to social housing. He wants to stop migrants from claiming child benefit for dependents living outside the UK, and remove those that have failed to find work after six months. Mr Cameron has promised to put reform of EU free movement rules at the heart of his renegotiation of Britain's relationship with the EU. He has ruled out a temporary cap on migrant numbers or an ""emergency brake"" on EU freedom of movement rules - ideas both mooted in recent months, saying this would be less ""effective"" than reducing the incentives for people to come to the UK. The party has a continuing goal to bring net immigration down to below 100,000 people a year (it currently stands at 243,000).Labour: ""Stronger"" border controls to tackle illegal immigration with ""proper"" entry and exit checks. ""Smarter"" targets to reduce low-skilled migration but ensure university students and high-skilled workers are not deterred. Employment agencies who only recruit abroad will be outlawed while the fines for employing illegal immigrants will be increased.Lib Dems: Reintroduce exit checks at borders, so the government can identify people who are overstaying their visa. Will require all new claimants for Jobseekers Allowance to have their English language skills assessed, with JSA then being conditional on attending language courses for those whose English is poor. Ensure that EU migrants have to ""earn"" their entitlement to benefits.SNP: Allow the devolved government to have control over immigration to Scotland, and introduce a Canadian-style earned citizenship system to attract highly-skilled immigrants.Plaid Cymru: Oppose a points-based system. Support the right of asylum seekers to work in Wales while they wait for status decisions to be made. Lobby the Westminster government to ensure that they shut ""detention"" centres.UKIP: Introduce an Australian-style points policy, used to select migrants with the skills and attributes needed to work in the country - covering people from inside and outside the EU. Bring net immigration down to 50,000 people a year. Priority lanes for UK passport holders. Increase UK border staff by 2,500. Tougher English language tests for migrants seeking permanent residence. Opt out of the Dublin treaty to allow the UK to return asylum seekers to other EU countries without considering their claim. Anyone who currently has the legal right to live, work, or study in the UK would not face deportation in the event of the country's withdrawal from the EU.Greens:  Progressively reduce UK immigration controls. Migrants illegally in the UK for over five years will be allowed to remain unless they pose a serious danger to public safety. More legal rights for asylum seekers.Taxes and the economyConservatives: Eradicate the deficit by 2018 and secure an overall budget surplus by 2019-20. Achieve this by spending cuts, not tax rises, while raising NHS spending. An income tax cut for 30 million people by 2020. Tax would start to kick in at £12,500 a year, instead of £10,500. This will cost £5.6bn. The higher tax rate, 40%, would start at £50,000 instead of £41,900, again by 2020, at a cost of £1.6bn. This will be paid for through £25bn in additional spending cuts and economic growth. No increases in VAT.Labour: Get the current budget into surplus and the national debt falling ""as soon as possible in the next parliament"". No additional borrowing for new spending. Reintroduce the 50p top rate of income tax for earnings over £150,000.  Cut income tax for 24 million people by bringing back the 10p rate, paid for by scrapping the Married Couples' Tax Allowance. Bring in a ""mansion tax"" on properties worth over £2m, to raise £1.2bn. A tax on bankers' bonuses. A 5% pay cut for every government minister. Push for UK overseas territories to be put on an international blacklist if they refuse to co-operate with a drive against tax avoidance. No increases in VAT or National Insurance contributions.Lib Dems: Raise the personal allowance - the point at which you start paying income tax - to £11,000 in April 2016 and then to £12,500 by 2020. ""Strict new fiscal rules"" to ensure the deficit has gone by April 2018, with the wealthy contributing the most. The Lib Dems invented the ""mansion tax"" but in contrast to Labour have set out how it would operate - along similar lines to council tax bands. There are also Lib Dem plans to increase capital gains tax - paid on profits from second homes or shares - from 28% to 35%. Impose an additional 8% rate of corporation tax on UK banks to raise an extra £1bn a year to help pay off the deficit.SNP: Oppose UK plans in the Infrastructure Bill which will allow oil and gas drilling and hydraulic fracturing beneath people's homes without consent. Invest in offshore wind farming. Support an international bank tax and limits to industry bonuses.Plaid Cymru: Build a Green Skills Construction College, specialising in green energy. Establish a publicly-owned energy company. Establish a publicly-owned Bank of Wales business investment bank. Enforce a living wage. Give devolved nations an equal say in institutions that affect everyone's lives, such as the Bank of England.UKIP: Increase the personal allowance to the level of full-time minimum wage earnings, about £13,500, by 2020. Abolish inheritance tax. Introduce a 35% income tax rate between £42,285 and £55,000, at which point the 40% rate becomes payable. Set up a Treasury Commission to design a turnover tax on large businesses. Cut foreign aid budget by £9bn a year. Scrap HS2. Save £8bn a year in membership fees by leaving the EU.  Lower the VAT rate charged on restorations to listed buildings.Greens: People earning more than £100,000 a year would pay 50% income tax. Wealth tax of 1% to 2% on people worth £3m or more. Renationalise the railways and energy companies. Scrap HS2. Allow councils to impose extra business rates on out-of-town supermarkets to fund small local businesses. Crackdown on tax avoidance by multinationals. Allow ""the current dependence on economic growth to cease, and allow zero or negative growth to be feasible without individual hardship"". Commit Britain to a ""zero carbon"" future. Cut rail and bus fares by an average of 10%. Enforce a cap on bankers' bonuses.The NHSConservatives:  Chancellor George Osborne says he will put an extra £2bn into frontline health services across the UK, which he described as a ""down payment"" on a plan drawn up by NHS bosses calling for an extra £8bn a year above inflation by 2020. In England, everyone would be able to see a GP seven days a week by 2020. Recruit 5,000 more doctors.Labour:  Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said Labour would commit an extra £2.5bn a year above Mr Osborne's plan. The money will come from three sources - a new ""mansion"" tax, clamping down on tax avoidance by big corporations and a new tax on tobacco companies. Patients in England would get a GP appointment within 48 hours and would not have to wait longer than a week for cancer tests and results. Scrap the Health and Social Care Act and end ""creeping privatisation"" of the NHS.  Integrate health and social care services into a system of ""whole-person care"". Give greater priority to mental health services. Replace the Cancer Drugs Fund in England when it runs out in 2016 with a £330m fund to improve access to innovative cancer drugs, surgery and radiotherapy. Recruit 5,000 more healthcare workers to help patients stay in their homes and introduce new safety checks to identify people at risk of hospitalisation. Prioritise child mental health by increasing the proportion of the mental health budget spent on children.Lib Dems: An extra £1bn for the NHS every year, to be funded by - amongst other things - making higher earners pay more tax on their shares. Half of this will go towards mental health. Ensure that spending on the NHS rises in line with growth in the economy. People who need therapy for conditions such as depression will be guaranteed treatment within 18 weeks. For young patients experiencing psychosis for the first time treatment will be provided within two weeks of being referred by a GP. This is all going to happen from April, with more mental health targets to follow if the Lib Dems return to government. Wants a cross-party review of the future of NHS funding.SNP: Reduce the number of senior managers in the NHS by 25% over the next parliament. Streamline the work of health boards. Real terms increases in year-on-year NHS spending.Plaid Cymru: Recruit 1,000 extra doctors to the Welsh NHS over two terms of a Plaid government. Offer financial incentives for recruiting doctors to areas and specialisms where there are, or are predicted to be, shortages. Encourage innovation and attract more research funding, in part by increasing research and development funding as government finance allows. Improve training for postgraduate doctors and stop them being used to ""plug gaps"" in staff rotas. More recruitment from within the EU to fill vacancies and using international doctors to staff the NHS while a new generation of Welsh doctors are trained.UKIP: An extra £3bn per year in NHS funding paid for by quitting the EU and through ""middle management"" cuts. Keep NHS free at the point of delivery. Stop any further use of PFI, and encourage local authorities to buy out their PFI contracts early where it is affordable to do so. Ensure all visitors and migrants who have been here for fewer than five years have NHS-approved medical insurance as a condition of entry to UK, with £200m of the £2bn saved to be spent on ending hospital parking charges in England. Bring back state-enrolled nurses and return powers to matrons. Monitor and Care Quality Commission to be replaced with elected county health boards. Stop spending £90m a year on gastric band and breast enhancement operations.Greens: Funding to be diverted away from centralised facilities towards community healthcare, illness prevention and health promotion.  Stop privatisation. Abolish prescription charges. Dedicated NHS Tax to go direct to the health service. Ban proactive recruitment of non-British NHS staff from overseas. A complete ban on the promotion of tobacco and alcohol products, including sponsorship.Security, defence and foreign affairsConservatives: Hold a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU by 2017, after negotiating the return of some powers from Brussels. Protect foreign aid budget. Replace Trident.Labour:  Push for reform of European Union and prevent Britain from ""sleepwalking"" towards exit. Commit in law to holding a Strategic Defence and Security Review every 5 years. Outlaw discrimination and abuse of Armed Forces personnel.Lib Dems: Campaign to reduce the number of Trident nuclear submarines. Push for greater European Union efficiency. SNP: Oppose nuclear weapons and push for removal of Trident submarines from Scotland. In 2010, proposed a Scottish Centre for Reconciliation and Conflict Resolution, to promote peaceful alternatives to armed conflict. Maintain 0.7% commitment to foreign aid. Enhanced role for Scotland within the UK in Europe, particularly in fisheries policy.Plaid Cymru: Honour commitment of 0.7% of budget used for foreign aid. Campaign for cancellation of developing countries' debts. Support the Fair Trade movement. Support the 'Tobin' or 'Robin hood' tax as a means of encouraging more responsibility and stability in the global markets. Reform the IMF and World Bank in order to improve regulation and accountability. Continue membership of the EU, but campaign for democratic reform. Support minority nations and minority language speakers around the world. Pass a Military Wellbeing Act to promote and safeguard the physical and mental health and wellbeing of military personnel.UKIP:  Leave the European Union. Remove the passports of any person who has gone to fight for a terrorist organisation and deport anyone who has committed a terrorist act. Cut foreign aid budget by £9bn. Create a Veterans Department to look after the interests of ex-service men and women.Greens: Referendum on Britain's EU membership. Want reform of EU to hand powers back to local communities. Boost overseas aid to 1% of GDP within 10 years. Scrap Britain's nuclear weapons. Take the UK out of NATO unilaterally. End the so-called ""special relationship"" between the UK and the US.  Stop EU-US free trade deal TTIP. JobsConservatives: Create three million apprenticeships to be paid for by benefit cuts.Labour: Guarantee a job for under 25s unemployed for over a year and adults unemployed for more than two years. As many young people to go on an apprenticeship as currently go to university by 2025. Create a million new high technology, green jobs by 2025. Ban ""exploitative"" zero hour contracts.Lib Dems: An extra £1 an hour for the lowest paid apprentices. Campaign to create a million more jobs.SNP: Introduce gender quotas on public boards. Living wage ""a central priority"" in all Scottish government contracts. Continue the 'small business bonus'.Plaid Cymru: Provide rates relief for small businesses. Increase the number and value of contracts from Welsh public bodies that go to firms within Wales.UKIP: Allow firms to offer jobs to British workers first ""without the fear of being sued for discrimination"".Greens: A national energy conservation scheme to create thousands of new jobs. The party wants to create ""sustainable jobs"" and promotes more local production of food and goods.Education Conservatives: Protect England's schools budget - from reception entry at age four or five to the end of GCSEs at 16 - in cash terms although funding per pupil will not keep pace with inflation. Pre-school and post 16 education not ring fenced. Convert up to 3,500 more schools judged by Ofsted to ""require improvement"" into academies. ""War on illiteracy and innumeracy"". State primary schools in England that repeatedly failed to have a proportion of year-six pupil pass times tables and writing tests be forced to become academies, or have sponsorship replaced if already an academy. Opposed to giving votes to 16 and 17-year-olds for UK-wide general elections and local elections in England.Labour:  Increase the overall education budget in England, including schools, nurseries, Sure Start and provision for 16-to 18-year-olds, by at least the rate of inflation, although per-pupil funding is not specifically protected, meaning some of the increase will be eaten up by rising pupil numbers. Parents of primary school children would be guaranteed childcare from 8am to 6pm. The amount of free childcare for three and four year olds would be increased from 15 to 25 hours a week. Compulsory sex and relationship education in all schools. Refuse to grant business rate relief to independent schools unless they can show a ""meaningful impact"" on state schools through a new School Partnership Standard, for example by lending teaching staff or assisting in university admissions procedures. Committed to extending the franchise to 16 and 17-year-olds in elections across the UK. Double the number of Sure Start childcare places to more than 118,000. Tighten up the rules on primary school class sizes to ensure they do not have more than 30 pupils.Lib Dems: Protect the education budget from cuts. Guarantee qualified teachers and a core curriculum set by independent experts, as well as compulsory sex education, in all state schools including academies and free schools. More money for disadvantaged school children and free childcare for all two year olds. A two-thirds discount on all local bus fares for young people aged 16-21. Supports lowering the voting age to 16 in all UK elections.SNP: Guaranteed free 30 hours of childcare a week for three and four-year-olds in Scotland, up from 16 hours. Maintain lack of tuition fees at Scottish universities, and offer financial support in grants and loans to students. Continue to build and refurbish schools. Lower voting age to 16 in all UK elections.Plaid Cymru: Introduce a compulsory modern foreign language GCSE in secondary schools and the teaching of modern foreign languages in primary schools. Look at ways to strengthen the teaching of Welsh history and culture. Oppose foundation schools, academies and free schools. Look at moving from a per-pupil funding mechanism to a funding model based on the catchment area. Will not support any further increases in tuition fees for higher education students, and will seek the abolition of tuition fees as and when public finances allow. Supports lowering the voting age to 16 for elections to the Welsh Assembly and the UK Parliament.UKIP: More grammar schools. Scrap sex education for children aged under seven. Scrap tuition fees for students from poorer backgrounds who take degree courses in the sciences, technology, maths or engineering. Greater emphasis on vocational education with new Apprenticeship Qualification Option. School governing boards must be made up of at least 30% parents of children at the school. Allow universities to charge same amount for EU students as non-EU students.Greens: End performance related pay for teachers. Replace Ofsted with an independent National Council for Educational Excellence. Bring Free Schools and Academies into local authority control.

Withdraw Jobseeker's Allowance from young people after six months unless they take part in ""community projects"". And 18 to 21-year-olds wouldn't be entitled to housing benefit. Ban on zero-hours contracts which stop people getting work elsewhere. Raise the personal allowance - the point at which you start paying income tax - to £11,000 in April 2016 and then to £12,500 by 2020, which means that if you work on minimum wage for 30 hours you will pay no income tax. Young people out of work, education or training for six months will have to do unpaid community work to get benefits. This will apply to about 50,000 18 to 21-year-olds. Universal benefits for pensioners, such as free bus passes, TV licences for the over 75s and the winter fuel allowance. will once again be protected. Labour: Freeze energy prices until 2017. Increase in the minimum wage from £6.50-an-hour to £8-an-hour by 2020. Rises in child benefit capped at 1% for the first two years of the next parliament. Winter fuel allowance would be withdrawn from the wealthiest pensioners. Repeal what the government calls the spare room subsidy, dubbed the ""bedroom tax"" by Labour.  A million interest-free loans to help people insulate their homes. Rail fares would be capped. Double the amount of paid paternity leave available to new fathers from two to four weeks, and increase statutory paternity pay to £260 a week.Lib Dems: Raise the personal allowance - the point at which you start paying income tax - to £11,000 in April 2016 and then to £12,500 by 2020 (the Conservatives are promising the same thing). Nick Clegg has said he would not accept Conservative plans to freeze working-age benefits without taxing the rich too. He hasn't said he would block welfare cuts altogether. Withdraw eligibility for the Winter Fuel Payment and free TV Licence from pensioners on the 40% rate of income tax. A ""yellow card"" system to deal with benefit claimants breaking the rules, rather than imposing sanctions without warning.SNP: Oppose cuts to in-work benefits. Support moves to extend paternity leave. Introduce a maximum combined withdrawal rate for benefits and reforms to employment support allowance and cold weather payments. Protect policies such as concessionary travel for older Scots.Plaid Cymru: Move away from complex and expensive means testing for child-related benefits. Continue to campaign for the introduction of a living pension during the period of the next parliament for those aged 80 and over. UKIP: Only pay child benefit for the first two children for new claimants. Increase the Carers' Allowance to the same level as Jobseekers' Allowance (JSA) and pay a higher rate of JSA if you've been in work and already made tax and National Insurance contributions. Prevent anyone taking up permanent residence in Britain unless they're able to support themselves and any dependents they bring with them for at least five years and stop them receiving benefits. Stop paying child benefit for children who don't live in Britain. Scrap what UKIP calls the ""detested bedroom tax"". Boost ""credit unions"".Greens: The party backs a Citizen's Income, a fixed amount of £72 income a week to be paid to every individual, whether they are in work or not, to be funded by higher taxes on the better off and green levies.  But in the short-term it would increase the minimum wage to £10 by 2020. Ban zero hours contracts. Axe the ""bedroom tax"". Abolish the work capability assessment and restore the level of the former disability living allowance. Scrap the government's welfare cap, which limits the maximum amount a household can claim annually to £26,000 a year."

2015-04-04,Elephant trap?,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32047998,"The campaign has not even got under way, yet in the space of a couple of hours we have now been treated to not only one election pledge, but to two. The prime minister ruled out raising VAT if re-elected - while Labour said National Insurance contributions wouldn't go up.Usually politicians fudge the question of tax rises.  When he was leader of the opposition David Cameron himself said ""we have no need to raise taxes"" - before hiking up VAT after polling day.Famously, John Major said he had ""no plans"" to put up the sales tax -  before his chancellor did just that.And when he appeared in front of the cross-party Treasury committee of MPs on Tuesday, the current chancellor seemed to be continuing that tradition.  Under repeated questioning, George Osborne said: ""The policies we have do not involve a VAT rise.""That formulation appeared to give him not so much wriggle room, but an entire wriggle mansion.Labour assumed their campaign warning of further VAT rises to come under the Tories was very much on the money.But George Osborne's allies are suggesting privately that he had, in fact, been walking Ed Miliband to the edge of an elephant trap, then beckoning the prime minister to push the opposition leader in.Ed Miliband's strategists fully expected Mr Cameron to repeat the chancellor's obfuscation on tax at the final Prime Minister's Questions of this Parliament. They would then have expanded on the theme, inviting the prime minister to answer other difficult questions - then say he wasn't being straight with the British people for avoiding them.But the Labour leader was completely wrong-footed when first the prime minister said he would rule out a VAT rise and then counter-punched, inquiring if Labour would now rule out an increase in National Insurance contributions.Ed Miliband dodged the question and what could have been downbeat Conservative benches, uneasy over the prime minister's announcement this week of his retirement plans, were given something to cheer.The reason Ed Miliband didn't respond is because he was holding the National Insurance pledge back for Labour's manifesto.But that soon became unsustainable - so the other Ed, the shadow chancellor Ed Balls, had to undertake a hasty round of the TV studios to do just that.When I spoke to him mid-tour, he put on a brave face. His view was that George Osborne, having raised VAT from 17.5% to 20%, wanted to give the issue a low profile - whereas the prime minister had now made the mistake of putting it centre stage. And he believed David Cameron's promise would be judged against his past VAT-raising performance.He defended Ed Miliband's reluctance to talk about National Insurance as he felt it would have been ""inappropriate"" to announce Labour tax policy at PMQs.So the prime minister - always a better tactician than strategist - can at least satisfy himself that he smoked Labour out on NI and disrupted at least one entry in their election campaign grid.But the exchange actually raised more questions than it answered.If the main parties are ruling out further potential sources of revenue, but still committing themselves to eradicating a £90bn black hole in the public finances, will they now be under more pressure during the election campaign to spell out in much greater detail exactly what they intend to cut?"
2015-04-04,Who's next?,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32031343,"David Cameron's declaration that he will not seek a third term in office if he retains power in May has immediately stoked interest in who might fill his shoes when he's gone. Here are the likely - and perhaps less obvious - possibilities.Claim? As chancellor of the exchequer he's the man in charge of the purse strings and master strategist - and reportedly the PM's favourite to succeed him, although he hasn't said as much. Mr Cameron's right-hand man has had an image makeover of late, with a new haircut and a diet to shed some pounds. And he has seemingly recovered from his ""omnishambles"" Budget in 2012, with his latest - and last Budget - of the parliament giving the Tories a lead in some polls. He's said to be well liked among Conservative cabinet ministers and backbench MPs, whose support is vital for any candidate wanting to take on the party leadership. He shas some work to do among grassroots Tory members, however, coming fifth in ConservativeHome's latest online poll of party members on future leaders.Latest odds: 10/1 (according to William Hill)What's he said? ""The prime minister leads a strong team but what you see from him is answering a direct question with a direct answer. I think that's really refreshing. He says he's going to serve that full five years so the real question facing the country now is do you want the strong leadership of David Cameron that's delivering zero inflation and record jobs or do you want the chaos and incompetence of Ed Miliband.""Claim? The longest-serving home secretary in 50 years, she is only the second Conservative woman to secure one of the top four jobs in government. In her role, she has talked tough on immigration and crime and taken on the Police Federation. And she is popular with Tory activists, consistently occupying either first or second place in ConservativeHome's online polls on future party leaders. There have long been claims of Mrs May positioning herself for the top job, with reported tensions between her and the prime minister. Critics say she lacks charisma and micro-manages - while some cannot forget her coining the now infamous ""nasty party"" phrase at a Tory conference in 2002, but supporters say she is a formidable operator, and have dubbed her Britain's Angela Merkel. Latest odds: 9/2What's she said? ""My view is very simple, David Cameron is a first class leader of the party and a first class prime minister and I hope he is going to be doing that for a very long time."" (Desert Island discs, 23 November 2014)Claim? The blonde bombshell and mayor of London who can seemingly reach voters that others in the party cannot. Casting aside a rather chequered past he steered the capital through the 2012 Olympics, launched the successful and popular ""Boris bikes"" and got rid of London's ""bendy buses"" in favour of the new Routemaster double deckers. Mr Johnson hopes to revive his Westminster parliamentary career at the general election. He has been tipped by many to take the helm of the Conservative Party, and has not discouraged the idea. Like Theresa May, he is also a favourite among the grassroots of the party, pipping her to the top spot in ConservativeHome's latest poll of party members on future leaders. (he's ahead by 2 points). Critics say the gaffe-prone politician is not the right man for the job, but his supporters point to his wide-spread appeal.Latest odds: 9/4What's he said? ""I think what David Cameron is saying is banal and obvious. There has already been a leader of the Conservative Party for ten years and he's done an outstanding job. What he's saying now is that he wants to serve through to 2020 and that is frankly what we need him to do... five more years is what this country needs. I'm not entirely certain I see what the story is. He was asked a straight question, are you going to serve a third term like Mrs Thatcher or Tony Blair and he said no, because he thinks that ten years on top of British politics is an incredibly long time.""Claim? A self-made millionaire and devotee of Margaret Thatcher, he is regarded as one of the Conservatives' fastest-rising stars. The Treasury minister-turned-culture secretary became the first of the 2010 intake of MPs to reach cabinet level, and the first Asian male Conservative cabinet minister. He's currently polling well among the Conservative grassroots, who voted him third most preferable leader in ConservativeHome's latest online future leader poll. David Cameron recently said he wants to see a British Asian prime minister in his lifetime.Latest odds: 12/1Claim? Currently holding one of the four great offices of state - foreign secretary - Mr Hammond's name has often cropped up whenever talk of leadership contenders has emerged. He has built up an impressive CV in government since the Conservatives came to power in 2010, being first awarded the job of transport secretary before his promotion to defence secretary where he stayed for three years. He's regarded by many commentators as being a potential candidate for the Tory right. He seems to have work to do among party activists, scoring only 4% in ConservativeHome's future leader poll.Latest odds: 12/1"
2015-04-04,Cereal number,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-magazine-monitor-31962592,"David Cameron has declared he won't seek a third term as prime minister, citing an advertising slogan for Shredded Wheat used in the UK more than 30 years ago. What's its enduring power, asks Justin Parkinson.The hotel kitchen staff are in disbelief. Someone in room 147 has ordered three Shredded Wheat. The maid transports them upstairs to find England cricketer Ian Botham waiting at a table, dressed in full whites.The maid leaves. Botham hides one of the Shredded Wheat under a napkin and winks to camera. Cue music, as the slogan ""Shredded Wheat. Bet you can't eat three"" appears.This advert and others featuring football manager Brian Clough and the actor Richard Kiel, who played Jaws in James Bond films, have not run for some time. Nestle, which owns the brand, says the last probably aired in 1984.But their message seems to have waned little. Telling the BBC he would only serve a limited time in Downing Street, David Cameron said: ""Terms are like Shredded Wheat - two are wonderful but three might just be too many.""The prime minister's reprise was unlikely to be accidental, says Thayne Forbes, joint managing director of the brand-valuation company Intangible Business. ""Everybody would empathise with the view that three Shredded Wheat would probably be too much,"" he says. ""The slogan suggests people shouldn't overdo it. It sounds modest and reasoned.""As marketing goes, it might seem counter-intuitive, as it discourages excessive consumption. But it also sounds honest and unexploitative.Other advertising slogans and themes are in wide use in public and political discourse. Examples include Marmite being a by-word for divisiveness - a ""Marmite person"" is either loved or hated. Cameron has twice referred to Ronseal - the woodcare product that does ""exactly what it says on the tin"". But Shredded Wheat, its best-known slogan having lain dormant for so long, appears to be used less often. The cereal, created in the US in the 1890s, has long been sold as good for the evolving British lifestyle. A newspaper advert in 1902 described it as ""a relief from the monotony of everlasting porridge"", while, by 1943, it was ""an ideal food for all war workers"". The 1980s saw an emphasis on ""simple, honest goodness"", while, in the 2000s, its long heritage and reliability was promoted.""It's a good association for Cameron,"" says Forbes. ""He must have been brought up on it, like lots of other people. It will be great marketing for Shredded Wheat to have the slogan used after so many years, too.""Subscribe to the BBC News Magazine's email newsletter to get articles sent to your inbox"
2015-04-04,Are you 'cosmopolitan'?,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32021853,"The rise of UKIP heralds the emergence of a new divide in British politics, with cosmopolitan voters on one side and non-cosmopolitan ones on the other, argues Jeremy Cliffe.We hear a lot about UKIP these days. The party stole the show at the local and European elections last year, then again in the autumn when it lured two Conservative MPs to defect.  In the past weeks alone there have been three much-discussed television programmes about the party: ""Meet the Ukippers"", ""Farage Fans and UKIP Lovers"" and ""100 Days of UKIP"". At the upcoming general election the party will probably increase its share of seats in Westminster - and will certainly affect the results in dozens of other constituencies by taking votes from the other parties. But ask some of those academics who have been watching UKIP's rise, and they will tell you that it is just one part of a bigger story. We are all used to the left-right divide in politics: a spectrum of different views on how much the government should tax, spend, regulate and otherwise intervene in the economy. But according to Dr Rob Ford of Manchester University, UKIP exists on a different axis, one to do with cultural rather than economic matters. This new political scale is ever more prominent in British political life.Radio 4's Analysis programmeOn the one end of it is what you might call a ""cosmopolitan"" philosophy: a relaxed, liberal attitude to issues concerning national identity (like immigration) and to questions of morality and lifestyle (like gay marriage). On the other end is a ""non-cosmopolitan"" outlook: more nationalist, socially conservative and less comfortable with social change, or in other words the ideological stance often associated with typical UKIP voters. This divide cuts across the left-right scale: there are cosmopolitan and non-cosmopolitan voters in both the Conservative and the Labour camps, which is why UKIP takes support from both.Lots of things are making this cosmopolitanism divide more important. One is that the old class-based, ideological conflict between left and right has declined. Dr James Tilley of Oxford University argues that politicians are partly to blame. The economic philosophies of the Conservative and Labour parties are so similar, he argues, that other, cultural issues are becoming more important. Another factor is the growing gap between the generations: the difference in outlook between the cosmopolitan young and less cosmopolitan, older voters is greater than it was in the past (partly due to the recent rise in levels of university education, which tend to correlate with liberal views). This trend presents the established parties with some difficult questions. As Dr Ford puts it, they ""have to try and deal with this rising value divide, particularly now that UKIP has mobilised it into the political debate."" ""They have to make a move,"" he adds, ""but any move that they make risks making their position worse with one or the other of these groups of voters."" Sound too cosmopolitan, and the parties risk losing supporters to UKIP. Try to ""out-UKIP UKIP"", and they could alienate their younger, more socially liberal supporters. So both are doing the political splits, trying to reconcile the cosmopolitans within their ranks with the non-cosmopolitans. Witness the tortuous attempts by Ed Miliband to sound tough on immigration without sounding too tough. Witness, too, the recent struggles of David Cameron to persuade social conservatives in his party that gay marriage can be an innately conservative institution. In the long-term, this divide will become less problematic. That is because over the years the country will tilt towards the cosmopolitan end of this new spectrum. So says Penny Young of NatCen, the research organisation that conducts the extensive British Social Attitudes survey. Various demographic factors explain this trend. The country as a whole is becoming more accepting of same-sex relationships. Younger voters are more relaxed about things like immigration and national identity than were previous generations when they were young, suggesting that the overall population will tilt in an internationalist direction over time. And ever more parts of the country are acquiring the ethnic and social diversity once confined to the inner cities, a trend that generally makes people more comfortable with immigration. According to Dr Ford the question is therefore: how should the main political parties navigate this period of transition? It would be wrong to simply abandon the swathes of voters at the less cosmopolitan end of the scale; voters who are usually older and more isolated than the average member of the population.Yet the politicians do need to adapt to the changing attitudes of British society and be honest with voters rather than pandering to views that, deep down, they do not share. This quandary may not decide the upcoming general election, but in the established parties savvy strategists with an eye to elections in 2020 and beyond are grappling with it nonetheless. That is a wise move."
2015-04-04,Dudley debate,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32015334,"I met Afzal Amin for the first time on Friday, but I already knew who he was. In Dudley North, the seat he was selected by the Conservatives to fight in the general election, Mr Amin had become hard to avoid. When I first looked at the local newspaper online, the pages were surrounded by ""Amin"" logos in the preferred Tory shade of blue.Not long after we met, he asked me to pose for a photo, snapped by one of his campaign team, and doubtless rapidly tweeted out to followers of the would-be MP.Perhaps no surprise that the man running such a disciplined operation has served in the army and been to Sandhurst. That was very much the message he delivered on Friday, as he addressed school and college pupils at a hustings in Dudley which I'd been invited to chair.There was combative debate, too, not least with his Labour rival, the MP Ian Austin. Both men knew the Dudley contest was critical for their respective parties; Ian Austin held the seat by just over 600 votes in 2010. Just as David Cameron was denied a majority by failing to take seats like this one, so Ed Miliband is unlikely to be in No 10 if Labour loses Dudley North.He was self-confident and fluent. The only obvious mis-step came right at the end, when he interrupted Vicky Duckworth, the Green candidate for the neighbouring seat. She expressed the opinion that politics often seemed to be about men shouting at each other; Mr Amin complained she was engaging in gender bias.A few weeks ago, one Conservative MP who knows him well and respects his talents, said Afzal Amin had warned him of the risks of over-confidence. He thought he risked running before he could walk.Well, he stumbled badly this weekend. Whatever the purpose of his contacts with the English Defence League - and he strongly disputes claims that he wanted them to hold a protest that would then be called off, for which he could then take the credit - the exposure has damaged him and, potentially, the prospects of his party re-taking the seat.In February, the EDL staged a rally against plans for a new mosque in the town. As the Mail on Sunday story makes clear, Afzal Amin pleaded with them beforehand not to hold that demonstration; but it went ahead anyway. It's what happened subsequently which will feature in Tuesday's disciplinary hearing.Over the weekend, I put his defence to a very senior Conservative source - that this was an attempt to broker a compromise in order to bring together a divided community. The arch response: Dudley isn't Kandahar.Nor do I think from my visits to the town, where I'm going to be based for the general election, will people in Dudley appreciate being painted as somewhere riven by racial discord.True, Dudley was the scene of one of England's earliest race riots. But that was in 1962. Although the controversy over replacing the mosque - currently in a converted school and inadequate for the numbers who want to worship there - has been running for a decade, community relations are generally good. Even those who don't want a new mosque didn't want the EDL protestors - nor to be fair the anti-fascist counter-demonstrators who followed them.As for the Conservative Party, the view of the national leadership is that you don't collaborate with the EDL. Not least because the Tories are still struggling to bury some historic baggage in the Black Country: Enoch Powell was an MP in Wolverhampton when he delivered his Rivers of Blood speech about immigration in 1968.Four years before that, there was the notorious election in Smethwick which the Conservatives were accused of winning by wooing white voters with an offensive rhyme suggesting who'd they'd get as a neighbour if they voted Labour. Afzal Amin grew up in Smethwick so he should be aware of that history. He was, until his suspension on Saturday, one of about 17% of Conservative parliamentary candidates who are not white. The party is proud of that, but it's still struggling to translate that into votes.Afzal Amin may believe that he can persuade the party to lift the suspension when he meets party officials on Tuesday. I have my doubts. Even if they accept his defence, will the other parties be so charitable? The allegations would follow him on the campaign trail, and make planned visits by cabinet ministers next to impossible.On Friday, just before the hustings in Dudley began, Afzal Amin gave me his business card. It introduces him as 'prospective member of Parliament Dudley North'. I think I'll keep it; it could yet become a collector's item."

2015-04-05,Bid to change Speaker election rules,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32061097,"A last-minute bid to change the way the Speaker of the House of Commons is elected is to be debated by MPs.Labour criticised the government motion, to be debated on the final day before the dissolution of Parliament, saying the Conservatives were ""trying to play politics with the speakership"".Under the proposals, a secret ballot would decide whether there should be a contested election for the post.MPs currently have to file through the division lobbies to cast their vote.This means it is clear who does or does not back the incumbent as Speaker.Labour's shadow leader of the Commons Angela Eagle raised the party's concerns in the House on Wednesday evening, questioning whether the motion was within parliamentary rules.Current Speaker John Bercow is - technically - one of them, but many Tory MPs have never liked him.They resent his personal style and some believe he is far from impartial in the way he conducts business in the Commons.Attempts by some to force a vote on his resumption as Speaker in 2010 came to nothing. There have been the occasional measured jibes at him from the prime minister. Other Tories reportedly went much further and formed a group whose members had all been reprimanded by him. But the Speaker is a reformer who believes passionately that the people who elect the members, and pay the bills, should come first.The last act of the coalition looks like being an attempt to unseat him. And they are very serious about it.One Tory MP fighting an important marginal seat had been cleared by his party to be away from Parliament but he is now staying for the vote, such is the importance of it.She told Deputy Speaker Lindsay Hoyle: ""It's just come to my attention that the government has tabled a motion for debate on the final day of this Parliament, with no notice whatsoever to myself as shadow leader of the House, proposing changes to the way in which the Speaker of this House is elected.""Procedural matters in this House, with no consultation with the opposition, no consultation with the chair of the committee itself, for debate in only one hour tomorrow.""Mr Hoyle said the motion had been ""rightly or wrongly"" agreed to on Tuesday, saying that ""business of the House is decided by the government, not by the chair.""A spokesman for Commons Leader William Hague said the motion had been tabled as a free hour had opened up in Thursday's business after the House of Lords approved the Modern Slavery Bill.The proposed change would apply when a Speaker wishes to continue in the post after a general election.Under the current rules, if the Speaker's re-appointment is objected to, a division is held, with MPs choosing to back or oppose the Speaker in the division lobbies.The replacement of this method with a secret ballot was suggested in 2010 by a committee of MPs, which said the public method ""can be seen as a deterrent to the House expressing its views honestly"".MPs will now debate whether this change should be made."

2015-04-05,MPs warn on growth of UK jihadists,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32059813,"Not enough is being done to prevent people leaving the UK to join Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, a group of MPs has warned.Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said Britain must win their ""hearts and minds"".The committee's report comes as the BBC launches a database tracking British jihadists in Syria and Iraq. It shows that many people left in clusters from certain UK areas - often due to friendships and peer groups. The MPs' report argued that preventative work with communities, families and international partners was ""vital"" and needs to be a top priority for the Home Office.  ""The number of cases being brought to public attention should ring alarm bells,"" said Labour MP Mr Vaz.  ""This must be a relentless battle for hearts and minds, and without a strong counter-narrative we are in danger of failing to prevent even more departures. We are at the edge of a cliff."" The BBC has been tracking the stories of the men, women, boys and girls who have gone to Syria and Iraq to understand why they go, where they go from and what happens to them. By analysing around 160 profiles, it reveals the way in which people have travelled in clusters - a group of three young friends from Coventry, another group from Portsmouth, drawn out by one person they knew, others in Cardiff linked to people involved in an extremist organisation. Social media might play a part but face-to-face contact appears just as, if not more, important, according to the database.It includes the stories of: The BBC research emphasises the extent to which real-world contacts, rather than just online connections, are often a key driver of radicalisation and intent to travel to Iraq and Syria. Some of the experts who appeared before the Home Affairs Committee also argued the internet was a secondary influence. They said that universities and prisons were among the two most significant places where radicalisation occurred. A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police, which was not aware of the report, said it would have ""welcomed the opportunity"" to have given evidence to the committee and that it planned to look at the report in detail.The disappearance of schoolgirls Shamima Begum, Amira Abase, both 15, and Kadiza Sultana, 16, from east London in February, raised questions as to who could have done more to prevent their departure. After taking evidence from the police and the families of the girls among others, Mr Vaz said their case suffered from a ""lack of immediate action"". He added: ""Schools and the police must inform parents immediately, and work with them even if there is the smallest hint of radicalisation, or a close association with someone who is thought to have been radicalised.""However, the Met Police spokesman defended the speed of the police response to the schoolgirls' disappearance.  He said the committee's criticism was ""misleading"", pointing to the evidence given by both UK and Turkish authorities of ""rapid exchanges"" between the two.The committee's report said there needed to be an advice service which would be a less extreme step than calling the anti-terrorist hotline.The Association of Chief Police Officer's lead officer for the government's anti-terror strategy Prevent, Chief Constable Sir Peter Fahy, agreed that more needed to be done.However, he said the police ""do not have the capacity"" to routinely work with every school in the country.He added: ""The police service will play its part but the prime responsibility for dissuading young people from getting involved in extremist activity has to lie with parents, families and carers.""The committee also pointed to weaknesses in information sharing with airlines and other countries. It said greater care needed to be taken at airport check-in desks when people were travelling to destinations of concern - namely Syria, Somalia, Iraq and Nigeria, as well as neighbouring countries, such as Turkey. The report said police also needed to work faster to alert overseas partners and airlines when there were concerns over individuals.There were signs that some of the girls had followed extremist accounts on social media, the report said.The committee said that social media companies, such as Facebook and Twitter, should be prepared to suspend accounts when there is evidence they are being used to promote violent extremism.  The report also said it was disappointed the Home Office had not implemented a programme for individuals returning to Britain where there is evidence they had fought in Syria.Security officials estimate that some 600 Britons have left the country to join IS - and while around half may have returned, many are still out there - and some have died.  The BBC project includes detailed profiles of individuals which can be searched, based on hometown, age and gender, as well as those who have been convicted in the courts or who are believed to have been killed."

If not, the prince's private letters will either remain confidential, as the sender intended, or they'll be exposed to a large and inquisitive audience.

That will be a clear pledge from us.""He accused Mr Cameron of making an ""out of the blue, panicky"" announcement on VAT that ""no one in Britain will believe"".Labour, which has already announced plans to increase the top rate of income tax and impose a new ""mansion tax"" on high value properties, insists its plans are fully costed and will not require additional tax hikes if it wins May's general election.Mr Miliband began his final head-to-head encounter with Mr Cameron before the election by joking that the PM had ""announced his retirement plans"" - a reference to a BBC interview in which the prime minister said he would not serve a third term if the Tories remained in power.Challenging Mr Cameron to give a ""straight answer to a straight question"", Mr Miliband pressed him on whether he would rule out a rise in VAT after the election, as Labour had done.In response, the prime minister immediately said ""yes"", prompting loud cheers in turn from the Conservative benches. He contrasted what he said was a ""clear promise"" with Labour's unwillingness to rule out a rise in National Insurance.""I answered a very simple question about VAT. I ruled out an increase... straight answer to him, straight question from me. I have ruled out VAT. Will he rule out national insurance contributions. Yes or no?"" Mr Cameron added: ""We all know this is Labour's job tax. This is their tax of choice. This is what they clobber working people, families and enterprises with.""But Mr Miliband responded by saying there was ""only one person who is going to raise taxes on working families and that is him"".He said nobody would believe Mr Cameron on VAT ""because of his extreme spending plans, because his numbers do not add up and because he promised it last time and broke his promise"".Mr Cameron, he added, had broken other promises made before the last election to reduce annual net migration below 100,000 and not to pursue a major structural re-organisation of the NHS, adding that it was ""time for a better plan and time for a Labour government"".But Mr Cameron suggested a future Labour government would result in the ""chaos of economic crisis"", with Ed Miliband being ""held hostage"" by the SNP.The packed session provided a last opportunity for the two men to rally their MPs and set out their arguments before the start of the election campaign next week.Speaking after the exchanges and the other parties' tax pledges, deputy prime minister Nick Clegg said the Lib Dems ""don't need to raise VAT, national insurance or headline rates of income tax or corporation tax either"".""There are other taxes and other tax loopholes that we can increase or close in order to balance the books,"" he said.

2015-04-05,Met police 'had files on MPs in 90s',https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32044580,"A former undercover police officer has told BBC News that Scotland Yard kept intelligence files on MPs during the 1990s. Ex-Special Branch officer Peter Francis says he saw files on 10 Labour MPs which he and others regularly updated. He says he personally gathered information on three MPs as part of his work infiltrating left-wing groups. The MPs named, and Labour, have called for a forthcoming public inquiry into undercover policing to be widened. Mr Francis operated undercover between 1993 and 1997 in the Met's now disbanded Special Demonstration Squad. He was told to embed himself in left-wing groups or causes that were deemed to pose a potential threat to security. He says that during this period he was told to gather intelligence on MPs and their activities if and when they featured in any of his operations. That information, he says, was added to a special pink file that was available for Special Branch officers to read. Between 1990 and 2001, he claims to have personally seen records relating to Diane Abbott, the late Tony Benn, Jeremy Corbyn, the late Bernie Grant, Peter Hain, Harriet Harman, Ken Livingstone, Joan Ruddock, Dennis Skinner and Jack Straw.Four of the group became ministers during Mr Francis's time in Special Branch - including Jack Straw who was home secretary after 1997. ""When I was deployed undercover in the Special Demonstration Squad, any MP that I came across, such as on demonstrations, I would report back on them,"" he said. Mr Francis says that the files not only contained the MPs' publicly-stated political views - but also intelligence on what was going on behind the scenes in the party or their group. He says some of the information would have been things said in private by the MP, depending on how close each undercover officer had been able to get. Mr Francis said that when he first saw the files he understood that each had probably been created before the individual was an MP because of their personal involvement in radical causes or protests.But he added: ""When they became MPs these files carried on. It [was] your duty as an SDS officer to report back any intelligence that you come across. ""I felt that it was OK to report back on MPs,"" he said. ""I used to give myself a pat on the back, thinking 'I have done a good job'. These MPs were spied on and they should know.""""I don't think the police force should be monitoring MPs, full stop. I don't think we have any right to do that at all. It may be justifiable to say that the Security Service should be doing it - but I certainly don't think the police should be doing it.""Scotland Yard has refused to comment on the substance of the claims, but a spokesman said it had not shied away from serious allegations about the SDS. It said that Operation Herne, the internal police investigation into what happened in the unit, remained an ongoing investigation.""Operation Herne maintains that without speaking to Peter Francis it is simply not possible to fully investigate allegations he makes,"" said a spokesman. ""Operation Herne remains very willing to engage with him.""Mr Francis said that he has refused to speak to Operation Herne because he fears being interviewed under caution as a suspect, rather than a whistleblower. Scotland Yard told the BBC that Operation Herne detectives would be prepared to speak to him as a witness. He has, however, spoken to Mark Ellison QC who reviewed allegations about the SDS for the Home Secretary Theresa May - prompting her to launch a statutory inquiry. He says he will appear before those hearings. Peter Hain, who was a leader of the anti-apartheid movement in the late 1960s and 70s and became an MP in 1991, said he now wants full answers from Scotland Yard. ""I was deeply disturbed to find that files were still being kept by the Special Branch while I and others were serving Members of Parliament,"" he said. ""That is constitutionally an outrage. It infringes the sovereignty of Parliament. ""I want to see the home secretary widen the scope of the inquiry into the SDS to look specifically at the surveillance of MPs and the fact that there were active files on us while we were serving Members of Parliament. ""This should never have happened and it should have been reported and properly authorised - and we don't know whether it was.""Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper echoed the call for the inquiry to be widened in light of what she described as ""extremely serious and disturbing allegations"".""While undercover policing remains a crucial tool in combating serious and organised crime it must not be abused,"" she said.""There have now been a series of serious allegations about undercover policing - ranging from the treatment of Stephen Lawrence's family to police having long-term inappropriate relationships. ""We called some time ago for much stronger oversight of undercover policing and it is also vital to get to the truth about what has happened."" Mrs May announced earlier this month that Lord Justice Pitchford would lead the inquiry into the SDS allegations - but the precise shape of that inquiry is not yet clear.A Home Office spokesman said the review by Mark Ellison QC had unearthed ""serious historical failings"". ""That is why the Home Secretary established a public inquiry to thoroughly investigate undercover policing and the operation of the Special Demonstration Squad. ""Lord Justice Pitchford will consult interested parties to the inquiry over the coming months on setting the terms of reference, with a view to publishing these at the end of July.""Undercover policing is an essential tactic in the fight against crime but to improve the public's confidence in undercover work we must ensure there is no repeat of these failings in the future."""
2015-04-05,NHS problems worst 'since 1990s',https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/health-32057948,"Services in the NHS in England are deteriorating in a way not seen since the early 1990s, according to a leading health think tank. The King's Fund review said waiting times for A&E, cancer care and routine operations had all started getting worse, while deficits were growing.It said such drops in performance had not been seen for 20 years.But the think tank acknowledged the NHS had done as well as could be expected, given the financial climate.Professor John Appleby, chief economist at the King's Fund, which specialises in health care policy, said: ""The next government will inherit a health service that has run out of money and is operating at the very edge of its limits. ""There is now a real risk that patient care will deteriorate as service and financial pressures become overwhelming.""He said in terms of how standards were slipping - not how low they had reached - the situation was the worst it had been since the ""early 1990s"".The report noted much of the deterioration has happened in the second-half of the Parliament with many measures of performance being maintained in the first few years.It said the next government had to address the funding situation, adding the extra £8bn a year NHS England says is needed by 2020, was the ""minimum"" that would be required.The report - a review of performance this Parliament - highlights a range of problems as well as achievements. These include:The report is the second part of the King's Fund pre-election review of the NHS this Parliament.Last month it warned the coalition government's reforms of the health service had been ""damaging and distracting"".The King's Fund report should make worrying reading. The reference to the 1990s conjures up images of - for the NHS at least - a bygone era. The think tank's point was not that waiting times had reached the level they were at then, rather that this is the first time in two decades of almost continuous improvement that there has been a sustained drop in performance.In many ways, that had to happen. Services cannot keep getting better for ever. Nonetheless, the findings are crystal clear: the NHS is at a critical juncture. But what is less easy to determine is to what extent the coalition's policies have contributed to the difficulties.The think tank has already provided a critical analysis of the government's reforms - and when pushed, acknowledged the health service may have been ""in better shape"" if they had not happened.But the more significant issue for the health of the health service this Parliament has been the squeeze on finances. Even though the budget has been increased, it has felt more like a cut to many because demands have risen so quickly.On this though, the King's Fund accepted that the government's hands were tied. Given the state of the economy, ministers did as much as they could have.Read more from NickRoyal College of Nursing general secretary Peter Carter said politicians needed to take note of the warnings made by the King's Fund.""Morale is low, and more and more staff are being made sick with stress because of the intolerable pressure they are under,"" he added. Katherine Murphy, of the Patients Association, said: ""The findings echo what we are hearing on a daily basis on our helpline. It is clear to the public that the future of the NHS is one of the most important issues facing the nation and it should be a central issue in the election campaign.""Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham said: ""Five years ago David Cameron stood on a promise to protect the NHS. This report provides authoritative proof that he has broken that promise.""But a Department of Health spokesman said: ""As the King's Fund says, the NHS has 'performed well in the face of huge challenges', but if we are to continue to invest in the NHS going forward it needs to be backed by a strong economy.""

2015-04-05,SNP 'could block Tory government',https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32045419,"The SNP would block a minority Conservative government by voting down its Queen's Speech if it holds the post-election balance of power, its former leader Alex Salmond has said.Mr Salmond said the move could bring down the government if Labour joined in, with David Cameron ""locked out"".The Conservatives accused him of ""trying to sabotage the democratic will of the British people"".Labour has called his balance of power prediction ""bluster and bluff"".In recent days Mr Salmond, who is bidding to become a Westminster MP at the 7 May general election, has claimed his party could ""hold the power"" in a hung Parliament and would be able to influence the Budget of a minority Labour government.This was dismissed by Labour leader Ed Miliband, who has ruled out a formal coalition with the Scottish nationalists.The SNP currently has six MPs at Westminster, but recent opinion polls suggest its share could increase dramatically at the general election.James Cook, BBC News Scotland correspondentIf the Conservatives attempt to form a minority government and enough MPs vote against their Queen's Speech the administration would fall at the first hurdle and the leader of the opposition would have a shot at forming a government.That's how parliamentary democracy works in the event of a hung Parliament.And yet the Conservatives are saying that by planning to vote against a government he opposes Alex Salmond has ""confirmed he would sabotage the democratic will of the British people in order to make Ed Miliband prime minister"".It is part of their continuing attempt to portray Mr Miliband as a weak leader whose strings are being pulled by Mr Salmond.This kind of language causes despair among Tories north of the border who fear that the party in London is waltzing into an SNP trap.They know that many voters in Scotland will read the phrase ""democratic will of the British people"" and hear ""democratic will of the English people"".Because, if it is illegitimate for Scottish MPs, from whatever party, to vote against one government and support another in the British parliament, then what, voters may ask, is the point of the union?Who is dancing to Mr Salmond's tune now?Mr Salmond, the former Scottish first minister, told the New Statesman that in the event of a hung Parliament, a minority Conservative government would have to ""go straight effectively for a vote of confidence - usually the Queen's Speech, although it could be otherwise, of course - and we'd be voting against.""If David Cameron lost this vote, he said, there would be a two-week period for another government to be formed.BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said Mr Salmond had ""hardened his anti-Conservative rhetoric"" in the interview.A Conservative spokesman said:  ""Alex Salmond has confirmed he would sabotage the democratic will of the British people in order to make Ed Miliband prime minister. ""That would mean chaos for Britain, with weak Ed Miliband dancing to Alex Salmond's tune.""He said the ""only way to keep Britain together"" was to vote Conservative.Mr Salmond's latest comments come after Mr Miliband said the only people writing a future Labour Budget would be himself and shadow chancellor Ed Balls.Speaking in Clydebank on Monday, he added: ""It's not going to be Alex Salmond - not in a million years."""
2015-04-05,MPs criticise 'lack of EU debate',https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32045290,"The government's ""failure"" to let MPs debate EU legislation is ""deplorable"", a Parliamentary committee says.The European Scrutiny Committee said ministers had refused to schedule debates on issues such as free movement and the EU's Budget.It also said BBC coverage of EU matters should be ""improved substantially"".The government said the number of EU debates had doubled since 2009-10, while the BBC said its coverage was ""extensive and impartial"".The cross-party committee's role includes scrutinising EU documents and recommending the most important for debate in the House of Commons.Its report said in the period covering most of the 2014-15 financial year there were three debates on the floor of the House, compared with 12 in 2013-14.It also pointed out that not a single debate had taken place during a nine-month period, between 9 June 2014 and 9 March 2015.""The government's collective failure to schedule so many debates on EU documents over the past year is deplorable, and is a discourtesy to this committee and to all members of the House,"" the MPs said.Prime Minister David Cameron has sought to rally support from other EU leaders for his plans to curb welfare payments to European migrants ahead of a referendum on the UK's membership if he wins the general election.The committee said the government's ""cavalier"" approach was ""at odds with UK ministers' claims in their speeches across the EU about the role of national parliaments"".The Foreign Office said the government was committed to a ""strong EU scrutiny system that enables Parliament to hold it to account for the decisions taken in Brussels"".It added: ""We have made good on our commitment to raise standards by doubling the number of Europe debates on the floor of the House since 2009-10.""This government has also increased by around a fifth since 2010 the number of EU proposals that have been scrutinised and cleared by Parliament before being agreed in Brussels.""The committee has also been examining the BBC's coverage of European issues, taking evidence from director general Lord Hall and head of news James Harding earlier this month.During that appearance, Lord Hall said the desire for balanced output ""ran deep"" within the BBC and he believed that this was being achieved.Mr Harding said if the public was going to trust the BBC to report on politicians impartially it had to be clear that BBC journalists weren't ""asked by politicians to come and account for what they do and in effect do the bidding of those politicians"".But the committee said it was ""concerned about the manner in which the BBC treats EU issues"", calling for coverage to be ""improved substantially"".It suggested coverage did not reflect all sides of the debate on the European Union, and more analysis was needed. Its chairman, Conservative MP Sir William Cash, said the BBC had ""very particular obligations"" to be impartial and to ""educate and inform"".He added:  ""We do not believe this is currently being achieved in the context of the BBC's EU coverage.""A BBC spokesman said the corporation provided extensive and impartial coverage of European and Parliamentary issues, and it would be a breach of the corporation's independence if a committee of MPs instructed the BBC on its coverage."
2015-04-05,Lobbyists must 'conform' with rules,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32047992,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe woman in charge of the government's new register of lobbyists has said she expects the industry to ""conform"" with the statutory system. Speaking ahead of the register's launch, Alison White conceded a lot of lobbyists would not be listed on it.But she said her job was to make sure the rules were implemented and she would do so with ""extreme verve and vigour.""But one critic of the register said it was ""fake"" and full of ""loopholes"".Lobbyists are companies or individuals paid to influence government decisions.The coalition promised to introduce a statutory register of lobbyists when it came to power in 2010, and legislation was passed last year, with ministers saying the move would help clean up politics.However, the new register will only cover consultant lobbyists and will not apply to lobbyists working ""in-house"" for companies or organisations.A person or company will only need to be registered if they are contacting a government minister or permanent secretary in a government department - leading to criticism it will not come close to reflecting the scale or nature of lobbying that goes on across Whitehall.But Ms White, who is independent of the government, said her task was to implement the law as it stood not to question the powers she had been given. ""We are having something that has never been in place before,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""This is a statutory register. The industry tells me it is a professional industry. I expect them to conform with the legislation. It is my job to make sure they do so.""Ms White, who was appointed as the registrar of consultant lobbyists in September, acknowledged the register would not indicate different ""levels of lobbying"".""The legislation was quite narrowly drafted to address a particular issue, which was that it was not always particularly clear, when ministers were being lobbied, who the client of the lobbyist was. That is what the register was set up to do,"" she said.She added: ""This will give anyone who wishes to access the register the opportunity to be able to see who is lobbying and being paid for it and who their clients are. That is the main information the register will contain.""If a lobbyist sets out to influence government policy in some way, they would have to be registered. If they are not registered, then they would not be conforming. They have to go on the register before they lobby.""Ms White said last month that the register would not have any entries on its launch day but she had received more than ""20 expressions of interest"" about joining and companies and individuals might be required to sign up retrospectively.Potential registrants will be able to log on and create an account to file an ""information return"".But Tamasin Cave, from the Alliance for Lobbying Transparency coalition, said ""hardly anyone"" in the industry would be covered by the provisions of the new law. ""You have a huge commercial lobbying industry, and very few of them will have to sign up,"" she told Today.""The second flaw is that it won't show the interaction between lobbyists and government, and that is what a register is for.""It is to show the activity - who is discussing what with whom, but this shows nothing of this interaction. It is a fake register."""
2015-04-05,Car smoking ban MSP welcomes backing,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-south-scotland-32055226,"The Liberal Democrat MSP behind a bill to ban smoking in cars when children are present has welcomed the support of the Scottish government.South of Scotland MSP Jim Hume launched the members' bill in December.The government said it was ""very supportive"" of the principles of the bill, but changes could be needed to make it ""workable"".Motorists could potentially be fined £100 for breaching the rule if it becomes law.Mr Hume lodged draft proposals for a bill last May calling for a ban in Scotland on smoking in private vehicles when children under 18 were present.He said he was ""over the moon"" at the news the Scottish government would endorse the Smoking Prohibition (Children in Motor Vehicles) (Scotland) Bill.He said: ""With cross-party support and the support of many third sector organisations, there is every chance that this could be in place in the next year.""Eighty-four per cent of the 160 responses to my consultation were positive and people from across Scotland have expressed their support for the move.""The bill is about guaranteeing that children in Scotland can have the freedom to go on and lead healthy lives if they choose to.""I look forward to working with MSPs from all parties as the bill progresses.""Public Health Minister Maureen Watt said the Scottish government had considered including the measure in its Public Health Bill, but instead decided to support Mr Hume's proposals.She said: ""As with any bill, as it goes through the scrutiny process, there may be amendments and improvements to strengthen the legislation and ensure it is fit for purpose. ""But we believe that the underpinning principles are strong, and that is why I am pleased to support it.""Scottish Labour and a wide range of health organisations have backed his proposals.But the Scottish Conservatives have reservations about how the bill would work in practice.The party's health spokesman Jackson Carlaw said: ""While Scottish Conservatives support any moves which would protect young people from hazardous second hand smoke we have concerns as to how this would be enforced.""It would be a better use of resources to conduct a public awareness campaign similar to that which is being proposed by the government in Wales.""We will be watching this campaign in order to ascertain what lessons may be learned and what approaches may be adopted in Scotland.""Anti-smoking campaigners welcomed the Scottish government's backing for Mr Hume's bill.ASH Scotland's chief executive Sheila Duffy said: ""It is another public health initiative that can help Scotland move forward with its ambition to achieve a tobacco-free generation in 20 years' time.""It is popular with the public and will bring Scotland into line with upcoming legislation in England and Wales.""We believe it can be effectively enforced and that having the legislation focus on cars with children bypasses concerns over interference in people's private lives.""Jim Hume must be congratulated for taking the initiative on this proposal and for all the hard work he and his team have done to bring this important measure forward.""But Simon Clark, director of the smokers' group Forest, said the bill was ""legislation for legislation's sake"".He said: ""Smoking in cars carrying children is inconsiderate. The overwhelming majority of smokers know that and don't do it.""The very small number that do will carry on regardless because the law will be difficult, if not impossible, to enforce.""Education has to be better than legislation but the government prefers gesture politics and the big stick."""
2015-04-05,Candidate quits over UKIP MEP remark,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32038485,"A UKIP election candidate has quit the party over comments made by the party's only Scottish MEP about a Scottish government minister.Tim Wilson has decided not to stand in South Northamptonshire after David Coburn MEP compared Humza Yousaf to convicted terrorist Abu Hamza.Mr Coburn has apologised for the remarks, saying it was a ""joke"".A spokesman for UKIP said Mr Wilson had failed to emphasise local issues in his general election campaign.UKIP leader Nigel Farage said Mr Coburn's remarks were a ""joke in poor taste"" but he would not be taking any action against him.But Mr Wilson said he was disillusioned with the party over the ""racist jibes"" and has decided to stand down.He told BBC Scotland he was appalled by Mr Coburn's comments about Mr Yousaf and frustrated by the inaction of the party's leadership on the issue.  He said David Coburn had produced ""what I can only describe as an Islamaphobic insult, and that's simply not acceptable"".  Mr Wilson added: ""Of course he went on and apologised.  I think, frankly, that if you are in a position of power you have to be able to control what ideas emerge from your head and how they get to your mouth and, in fact, you shouldn't have those ideas in the first place.  ""But the real issue is that when Mr Farage was asked what he thought about this he dismissed this as a joke.  ""I don't think this is a joke. I think this is something very serious.  It may not be that this man intended to cause offence but we aren't interested in what his intentions are.  We are interested in the effect what he says has on other people and the effect is catastrophic, it's appalling and I've resigned.""In his resignation letter, Mr Wilson said he had been ""systematically gagged by the party whip"" and forbidden to speak about Islam favourably. A spokesman for UKIP said Mr Wilson had failed to put more emphasis on local issues in his campaign.He said: ""Whilst we had initially been optimistic about Tim Wilson's abilities as a candidate, it became obvious in recent weeks that he was out of his depth in representing our party in the way we would expect. ""Mr Wilson had clearly misunderstood the expectations that UKIP place on all of its candidates. Principal amongst those is focusing on issues that are relevant to local voters. UKIP put huge emphasis on local issues and Mr Wilson was unwilling to follow UKIP guidelines in this respect.""Last week MSPs at the Scottish Parliament unanimously condemned the remarks made by Mr Coburn during a newspaper interview.MSPs were debating a motion celebrating Scotland's diverse communities.The president of the European Parliament, Martin Schulz, condemned the remarks, saying they were ""not worthy of any elected member"". But a spokesman for the president said he could not act on remarks made outside parliament.The move comes just days after another candidate, Jonathan Stanley, quit in protest at the ""racist filth"" in UKIP. Mr Stanley, who was due to stand in the Cumbrian seat of Westmorland and Lonsdale, was the party's former head of policy in Scotland."

2015-04-05,Manifesto watch,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-29642613,"Political parties are putting together their manifestos for May's general election. Here's a guide to where they currently stand on the issues voters say they care about most (according to pollsters IPSOS Mori).ImmigrationConservatives:  David Cameron wants to make migrants wait four years before they can claim certain benefits, such as tax credits, Universal Credit, or get access to social housing. He wants to stop migrants from claiming child benefit for dependents living outside the UK, and remove those that have failed to find work after six months. Mr Cameron has promised to put reform of EU free movement rules at the heart of his renegotiation of Britain's relationship with the EU. He has ruled out a temporary cap on migrant numbers or an ""emergency brake"" on EU freedom of movement rules - ideas both mooted in recent months, saying this would be less ""effective"" than reducing the incentives for people to come to the UK. The party has a continuing goal to bring net immigration down to below 100,000 people a year (it currently stands at 243,000).Labour: ""Stronger"" border controls to tackle illegal immigration with ""proper"" entry and exit checks. ""Smarter"" targets to reduce low-skilled migration but ensure university students and high-skilled workers are not deterred. Employment agencies who only recruit abroad will be outlawed while the fines for employing illegal immigrants will be increased.Lib Dems: Reintroduce exit checks at borders, so the government can identify people who are overstaying their visa. Will require all new claimants for Jobseekers Allowance to have their English language skills assessed, with JSA then being conditional on attending language courses for those whose English is poor. Ensure that EU migrants have to ""earn"" their entitlement to benefits.SNP: Allow the devolved government to have control over immigration to Scotland, and introduce a Canadian-style earned citizenship system to attract highly-skilled immigrants.Plaid Cymru: Oppose a points-based system. Support the right of asylum seekers to work in Wales while they wait for status decisions to be made. Lobby the Westminster government to ensure that they shut ""detention"" centres.UKIP: Introduce an Australian-style points policy, used to select migrants with the skills and attributes needed to work in the country - covering people from inside and outside the EU. Bring net immigration down to 50,000 people a year. Priority lanes for UK passport holders. Increase UK border staff by 2,500. Tougher English language tests for migrants seeking permanent residence. Opt out of the Dublin treaty to allow the UK to return asylum seekers to other EU countries without considering their claim. Anyone who currently has the legal right to live, work, or study in the UK would not face deportation in the event of the country's withdrawal from the EU.Greens:  Progressively reduce UK immigration controls. Migrants illegally in the UK for over five years will be allowed to remain unless they pose a serious danger to public safety. More legal rights for asylum seekers.Taxes and the economyConservatives: Eradicate the deficit by 2018 and secure an overall budget surplus by 2019-20. Achieve this by spending cuts, not tax rises, while raising NHS spending. An income tax cut for 30 million people by 2020. Tax would start to kick in at £12,500 a year, instead of £10,500. This will cost £5.6bn. The higher tax rate, 40%, would start at £50,000 instead of £41,900, again by 2020, at a cost of £1.6bn. This will be paid for through £25bn in additional spending cuts and economic growth. No increases in VAT.Labour: Get the current budget into surplus and the national debt falling ""as soon as possible in the next parliament"". No additional borrowing for new spending. Reintroduce the 50p top rate of income tax for earnings over £150,000.  Cut income tax for 24 million people by bringing back the 10p rate, paid for by scrapping the Married Couples' Tax Allowance. Bring in a ""mansion tax"" on properties worth over £2m, to raise £1.2bn. A tax on bankers' bonuses. A 5% pay cut for every government minister. Push for UK overseas territories to be put on an international blacklist if they refuse to co-operate with a drive against tax avoidance. No increases in VAT or National Insurance contributions.Lib Dems: Raise the personal allowance - the point at which you start paying income tax - to £11,000 in April 2016 and then to £12,500 by 2020. ""Strict new fiscal rules"" to ensure the deficit has gone by April 2018, with the wealthy contributing the most. The Lib Dems invented the ""mansion tax"" but in contrast to Labour have set out how it would operate - along similar lines to council tax bands. There are also Lib Dem plans to increase capital gains tax - paid on profits from second homes or shares - from 28% to 35%. Impose an additional 8% rate of corporation tax on UK banks to raise an extra £1bn a year to help pay off the deficit.SNP: Oppose UK plans in the Infrastructure Bill which will allow oil and gas drilling and hydraulic fracturing beneath people's homes without consent. Invest in offshore wind farming. Support an international bank tax and limits to industry bonuses.Plaid Cymru: Build a Green Skills Construction College, specialising in green energy. Establish a publicly-owned energy company. Establish a publicly-owned Bank of Wales business investment bank. Enforce a living wage. Give devolved nations an equal say in institutions that affect everyone's lives, such as the Bank of England.UKIP: Increase the personal allowance to the level of full-time minimum wage earnings, about £13,500, by 2020. Abolish inheritance tax. Introduce a 35% income tax rate between £42,285 and £55,000, at which point the 40% rate becomes payable. Set up a Treasury Commission to design a turnover tax on large businesses. Cut foreign aid budget by £9bn a year. Scrap HS2. Save £8bn a year in membership fees by leaving the EU.  Lower the VAT rate charged on restorations to listed buildings.Greens: People earning more than £100,000 a year would pay 50% income tax. Wealth tax of 1% to 2% on people worth £3m or more. Renationalise the railways and energy companies. Scrap HS2. Allow councils to impose extra business rates on out-of-town supermarkets to fund small local businesses. Crackdown on tax avoidance by multinationals. Allow ""the current dependence on economic growth to cease, and allow zero or negative growth to be feasible without individual hardship"". Commit Britain to a ""zero carbon"" future. Cut rail and bus fares by an average of 10%. Enforce a cap on bankers' bonuses.The NHSConservatives:  Chancellor George Osborne says he will put an extra £2bn into frontline health services across the UK, which he described as a ""down payment"" on a plan drawn up by NHS bosses calling for an extra £8bn a year above inflation by 2020. In England, everyone would be able to see a GP seven days a week by 2020. Recruit 5,000 more doctors.Labour:  Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said Labour would commit an extra £2.5bn a year above Mr Osborne's plan. The money will come from three sources - a new ""mansion"" tax, clamping down on tax avoidance by big corporations and a new tax on tobacco companies. Patients in England would get a GP appointment within 48 hours and would not have to wait longer than a week for cancer tests and results. Scrap the Health and Social Care Act and end ""creeping privatisation"" of the NHS.  Integrate health and social care services into a system of ""whole-person care"". Give greater priority to mental health services. Replace the Cancer Drugs Fund in England when it runs out in 2016 with a £330m fund to improve access to innovative cancer drugs, surgery and radiotherapy. Recruit 5,000 more healthcare workers to help patients stay in their homes and introduce new safety checks to identify people at risk of hospitalisation. Prioritise child mental health by increasing the proportion of the mental health budget spent on children.Lib Dems: An extra £1bn for the NHS every year, to be funded by - amongst other things - making higher earners pay more tax on their shares. Half of this will go towards mental health. Ensure that spending on the NHS rises in line with growth in the economy. People who need therapy for conditions such as depression will be guaranteed treatment within 18 weeks. For young patients experiencing psychosis for the first time treatment will be provided within two weeks of being referred by a GP. This is all going to happen from April, with more mental health targets to follow if the Lib Dems return to government. Wants a cross-party review of the future of NHS funding.SNP: Reduce the number of senior managers in the NHS by 25% over the next parliament. Streamline the work of health boards. Real terms increases in year-on-year NHS spending.Plaid Cymru: Recruit 1,000 extra doctors to the Welsh NHS over two terms of a Plaid government. Offer financial incentives for recruiting doctors to areas and specialisms where there are, or are predicted to be, shortages. Encourage innovation and attract more research funding, in part by increasing research and development funding as government finance allows. Improve training for postgraduate doctors and stop them being used to ""plug gaps"" in staff rotas. More recruitment from within the EU to fill vacancies and using international doctors to staff the NHS while a new generation of Welsh doctors are trained.UKIP: An extra £3bn per year in NHS funding paid for by quitting the EU and through ""middle management"" cuts. Keep NHS free at the point of delivery. Stop any further use of PFI, and encourage local authorities to buy out their PFI contracts early where it is affordable to do so. Ensure all visitors and migrants who have been here for fewer than five years have NHS-approved medical insurance as a condition of entry to UK, with £200m of the £2bn saved to be spent on ending hospital parking charges in England. Bring back state-enrolled nurses and return powers to matrons. Monitor and Care Quality Commission to be replaced with elected county health boards. Stop spending £90m a year on gastric band and breast enhancement operations.Greens: Funding to be diverted away from centralised facilities towards community healthcare, illness prevention and health promotion.  Stop privatisation. Abolish prescription charges. Dedicated NHS Tax to go direct to the health service. Ban proactive recruitment of non-British NHS staff from overseas. A complete ban on the promotion of tobacco and alcohol products, including sponsorship.Security, defence and foreign affairsConservatives: Hold a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU by 2017, after negotiating the return of some powers from Brussels. Protect foreign aid budget. Replace Trident.Labour:  Push for reform of European Union and prevent Britain from ""sleepwalking"" towards exit. Commit in law to holding a Strategic Defence and Security Review every 5 years. Outlaw discrimination and abuse of Armed Forces personnel.Lib Dems: Campaign to reduce the number of Trident nuclear submarines. Push for greater European Union efficiency. SNP: Oppose nuclear weapons and push for removal of Trident submarines from Scotland. In 2010, proposed a Scottish Centre for Reconciliation and Conflict Resolution, to promote peaceful alternatives to armed conflict. Maintain 0.7% commitment to foreign aid. Enhanced role for Scotland within the UK in Europe, particularly in fisheries policy.Plaid Cymru: Honour commitment of 0.7% of budget used for foreign aid. Campaign for cancellation of developing countries' debts. Support the Fair Trade movement. Support the 'Tobin' or 'Robin hood' tax as a means of encouraging more responsibility and stability in the global markets. Reform the IMF and World Bank in order to improve regulation and accountability. Continue membership of the EU, but campaign for democratic reform. Support minority nations and minority language speakers around the world. Pass a Military Wellbeing Act to promote and safeguard the physical and mental health and wellbeing of military personnel.UKIP:  Leave the European Union. Remove the passports of any person who has gone to fight for a terrorist organisation and deport anyone who has committed a terrorist act. Cut foreign aid budget by £9bn. Create a Veterans Department to look after the interests of ex-service men and women.Greens: Referendum on Britain's EU membership. Want reform of EU to hand powers back to local communities. Boost overseas aid to 1% of GDP within 10 years. Scrap Britain's nuclear weapons. Take the UK out of NATO unilaterally. End the so-called ""special relationship"" between the UK and the US.  Stop EU-US free trade deal TTIP. JobsConservatives: Create three million apprenticeships to be paid for by benefit cuts.Labour: Guarantee a job for under 25s unemployed for over a year and adults unemployed for more than two years. As many young people to go on an apprenticeship as currently go to university by 2025. Create a million new high technology, green jobs by 2025. Ban ""exploitative"" zero hour contracts.Lib Dems: An extra £1 an hour for the lowest paid apprentices. Campaign to create a million more jobs.SNP: Introduce gender quotas on public boards. Living wage ""a central priority"" in all Scottish government contracts. Continue the 'small business bonus'.Plaid Cymru: Provide rates relief for small businesses. Increase the number and value of contracts from Welsh public bodies that go to firms within Wales.UKIP: Allow firms to offer jobs to British workers first ""without the fear of being sued for discrimination"".Greens: A national energy conservation scheme to create thousands of new jobs. The party wants to create ""sustainable jobs"" and promotes more local production of food and goods.Education Conservatives: Protect England's schools budget - from reception entry at age four or five to the end of GCSEs at 16 - in cash terms although funding per pupil will not keep pace with inflation. Pre-school and post 16 education not ring fenced. Convert up to 3,500 more schools judged by Ofsted to ""require improvement"" into academies. ""War on illiteracy and innumeracy"". State primary schools in England that repeatedly failed to have a proportion of year-six pupil pass times tables and writing tests be forced to become academies, or have sponsorship replaced if already an academy. Opposed to giving votes to 16 and 17-year-olds for UK-wide general elections and local elections in England.Labour:  Increase the overall education budget in England, including schools, nurseries, Sure Start and provision for 16-to 18-year-olds, by at least the rate of inflation, although per-pupil funding is not specifically protected, meaning some of the increase will be eaten up by rising pupil numbers. Parents of primary school children would be guaranteed childcare from 8am to 6pm. The amount of free childcare for three and four year olds would be increased from 15 to 25 hours a week. Compulsory sex and relationship education in all schools. Refuse to grant business rate relief to independent schools unless they can show a ""meaningful impact"" on state schools through a new School Partnership Standard, for example by lending teaching staff or assisting in university admissions procedures. Committed to extending the franchise to 16 and 17-year-olds in elections across the UK. Double the number of Sure Start childcare places to more than 118,000. Tighten up the rules on primary school class sizes to ensure they do not have more than 30 pupils.Lib Dems: Protect the education budget from cuts. Guarantee qualified teachers and a core curriculum set by independent experts, as well as compulsory sex education, in all state schools including academies and free schools. More money for disadvantaged school children and free childcare for all two year olds. A two-thirds discount on all local bus fares for young people aged 16-21. Supports lowering the voting age to 16 in all UK elections.SNP: Guaranteed free 30 hours of childcare a week for three and four-year-olds in Scotland, up from 16 hours. Maintain lack of tuition fees at Scottish universities, and offer financial support in grants and loans to students. Continue to build and refurbish schools. Lower voting age to 16 in all UK elections.Plaid Cymru: Introduce a compulsory modern foreign language GCSE in secondary schools and the teaching of modern foreign languages in primary schools. Look at ways to strengthen the teaching of Welsh history and culture. Oppose foundation schools, academies and free schools. Look at moving from a per-pupil funding mechanism to a funding model based on the catchment area. Will not support any further increases in tuition fees for higher education students, and will seek the abolition of tuition fees as and when public finances allow. Supports lowering the voting age to 16 for elections to the Welsh Assembly and the UK Parliament.UKIP: More grammar schools. Scrap sex education for children aged under seven. Scrap tuition fees for students from poorer backgrounds who take degree courses in the sciences, technology, maths or engineering. Greater emphasis on vocational education with new Apprenticeship Qualification Option. School governing boards must be made up of at least 30% parents of children at the school. Allow universities to charge same amount for EU students as non-EU students.Greens: End performance related pay for teachers. Replace Ofsted with an independent National Council for Educational Excellence. Bring Free Schools and Academies into local authority control.

Withdraw Jobseeker's Allowance from young people after six months unless they take part in ""community projects"". And 18 to 21-year-olds wouldn't be entitled to housing benefit. Ban on zero-hours contracts which stop people getting work elsewhere. Raise the personal allowance - the point at which you start paying income tax - to £11,000 in April 2016 and then to £12,500 by 2020, which means that if you work on minimum wage for 30 hours you will pay no income tax. Young people out of work, education or training for six months will have to do unpaid community work to get benefits. This will apply to about 50,000 18 to 21-year-olds. Universal benefits for pensioners, such as free bus passes, TV licences for the over 75s and the winter fuel allowance. will once again be protected. Labour: Freeze energy prices until 2017. Increase in the minimum wage from £6.50-an-hour to £8-an-hour by 2020. Rises in child benefit capped at 1% for the first two years of the next parliament. Winter fuel allowance would be withdrawn from the wealthiest pensioners. Repeal what the government calls the spare room subsidy, dubbed the ""bedroom tax"" by Labour.  A million interest-free loans to help people insulate their homes. Rail fares would be capped. Double the amount of paid paternity leave available to new fathers from two to four weeks, and increase statutory paternity pay to £260 a week.Lib Dems: Raise the personal allowance - the point at which you start paying income tax - to £11,000 in April 2016 and then to £12,500 by 2020 (the Conservatives are promising the same thing). Nick Clegg has said he would not accept Conservative plans to freeze working-age benefits without taxing the rich too. He hasn't said he would block welfare cuts altogether. Withdraw eligibility for the Winter Fuel Payment and free TV Licence from pensioners on the 40% rate of income tax. A ""yellow card"" system to deal with benefit claimants breaking the rules, rather than imposing sanctions without warning.SNP: Oppose cuts to in-work benefits. Support moves to extend paternity leave. Introduce a maximum combined withdrawal rate for benefits and reforms to employment support allowance and cold weather payments. Protect policies such as concessionary travel for older Scots.Plaid Cymru: Move away from complex and expensive means testing for child-related benefits. Continue to campaign for the introduction of a living pension during the period of the next parliament for those aged 80 and over. UKIP: Only pay child benefit for the first two children for new claimants. Increase the Carers' Allowance to the same level as Jobseekers' Allowance (JSA) and pay a higher rate of JSA if you've been in work and already made tax and National Insurance contributions. Prevent anyone taking up permanent residence in Britain unless they're able to support themselves and any dependents they bring with them for at least five years and stop them receiving benefits. Stop paying child benefit for children who don't live in Britain. Scrap what UKIP calls the ""detested bedroom tax"". Boost ""credit unions"".Greens: The party backs a Citizen's Income, a fixed amount of £72 income a week to be paid to every individual, whether they are in work or not, to be funded by higher taxes on the better off and green levies.  But in the short-term it would increase the minimum wage to £10 by 2020. Ban zero hours contracts. Axe the ""bedroom tax"". Abolish the work capability assessment and restore the level of the former disability living allowance. Scrap the government's welfare cap, which limits the maximum amount a household can claim annually to £26,000 a year."

2015-04-05,Elephant trap?,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32047998,"The campaign has not even got under way, yet in the space of a couple of hours we have now been treated to not only one election pledge, but to two. The prime minister ruled out raising VAT if re-elected - while Labour said National Insurance contributions wouldn't go up.Usually politicians fudge the question of tax rises.  When he was leader of the opposition David Cameron himself said ""we have no need to raise taxes"" - before hiking up VAT after polling day.Famously, John Major said he had ""no plans"" to put up the sales tax -  before his chancellor did just that.And when he appeared in front of the cross-party Treasury committee of MPs on Tuesday, the current chancellor seemed to be continuing that tradition.  Under repeated questioning, George Osborne said: ""The policies we have do not involve a VAT rise.""That formulation appeared to give him not so much wriggle room, but an entire wriggle mansion.Labour assumed their campaign warning of further VAT rises to come under the Tories was very much on the money.But George Osborne's allies are suggesting privately that he had, in fact, been walking Ed Miliband to the edge of an elephant trap, then beckoning the prime minister to push the opposition leader in.Ed Miliband's strategists fully expected Mr Cameron to repeat the chancellor's obfuscation on tax at the final Prime Minister's Questions of this Parliament. They would then have expanded on the theme, inviting the prime minister to answer other difficult questions - then say he wasn't being straight with the British people for avoiding them.But the Labour leader was completely wrong-footed when first the prime minister said he would rule out a VAT rise and then counter-punched, inquiring if Labour would now rule out an increase in National Insurance contributions.Ed Miliband dodged the question and what could have been downbeat Conservative benches, uneasy over the prime minister's announcement this week of his retirement plans, were given something to cheer.The reason Ed Miliband didn't respond is because he was holding the National Insurance pledge back for Labour's manifesto.But that soon became unsustainable - so the other Ed, the shadow chancellor Ed Balls, had to undertake a hasty round of the TV studios to do just that.When I spoke to him mid-tour, he put on a brave face. His view was that George Osborne, having raised VAT from 17.5% to 20%, wanted to give the issue a low profile - whereas the prime minister had now made the mistake of putting it centre stage. And he believed David Cameron's promise would be judged against his past VAT-raising performance.He defended Ed Miliband's reluctance to talk about National Insurance as he felt it would have been ""inappropriate"" to announce Labour tax policy at PMQs.So the prime minister - always a better tactician than strategist - can at least satisfy himself that he smoked Labour out on NI and disrupted at least one entry in their election campaign grid.But the exchange actually raised more questions than it answered.If the main parties are ruling out further potential sources of revenue, but still committing themselves to eradicating a £90bn black hole in the public finances, will they now be under more pressure during the election campaign to spell out in much greater detail exactly what they intend to cut?"
2015-04-05,Who's next?,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32031343,"David Cameron's declaration that he will not seek a third term in office if he retains power in May has immediately stoked interest in who might fill his shoes when he's gone. Here are the likely - and perhaps less obvious - possibilities.Claim? As chancellor of the exchequer he's the man in charge of the purse strings and master strategist - and reportedly the PM's favourite to succeed him, although he hasn't said as much. Mr Cameron's right-hand man has had an image makeover of late, with a new haircut and a diet to shed some pounds. And he has seemingly recovered from his ""omnishambles"" Budget in 2012, with his latest - and last Budget - of the parliament giving the Tories a lead in some polls. He's said to be well liked among Conservative cabinet ministers and backbench MPs, whose support is vital for any candidate wanting to take on the party leadership. He shas some work to do among grassroots Tory members, however, coming fifth in ConservativeHome's latest online poll of party members on future leaders.Latest odds: 10/1 (according to William Hill)What's he said? ""The prime minister leads a strong team but what you see from him is answering a direct question with a direct answer. I think that's really refreshing. He says he's going to serve that full five years so the real question facing the country now is do you want the strong leadership of David Cameron that's delivering zero inflation and record jobs or do you want the chaos and incompetence of Ed Miliband.""Claim? The longest-serving home secretary in 50 years, she is only the second Conservative woman to secure one of the top four jobs in government. In her role, she has talked tough on immigration and crime and taken on the Police Federation. And she is popular with Tory activists, consistently occupying either first or second place in ConservativeHome's online polls on future party leaders. There have long been claims of Mrs May positioning herself for the top job, with reported tensions between her and the prime minister. Critics say she lacks charisma and micro-manages - while some cannot forget her coining the now infamous ""nasty party"" phrase at a Tory conference in 2002, but supporters say she is a formidable operator, and have dubbed her Britain's Angela Merkel. Latest odds: 9/2What's she said? ""My view is very simple, David Cameron is a first class leader of the party and a first class prime minister and I hope he is going to be doing that for a very long time."" (Desert Island discs, 23 November 2014)Claim? The blonde bombshell and mayor of London who can seemingly reach voters that others in the party cannot. Casting aside a rather chequered past he steered the capital through the 2012 Olympics, launched the successful and popular ""Boris bikes"" and got rid of London's ""bendy buses"" in favour of the new Routemaster double deckers. Mr Johnson hopes to revive his Westminster parliamentary career at the general election. He has been tipped by many to take the helm of the Conservative Party, and has not discouraged the idea. Like Theresa May, he is also a favourite among the grassroots of the party, pipping her to the top spot in ConservativeHome's latest poll of party members on future leaders. (he's ahead by 2 points). Critics say the gaffe-prone politician is not the right man for the job, but his supporters point to his wide-spread appeal.Latest odds: 9/4What's he said? ""I think what David Cameron is saying is banal and obvious. There has already been a leader of the Conservative Party for ten years and he's done an outstanding job. What he's saying now is that he wants to serve through to 2020 and that is frankly what we need him to do... five more years is what this country needs. I'm not entirely certain I see what the story is. He was asked a straight question, are you going to serve a third term like Mrs Thatcher or Tony Blair and he said no, because he thinks that ten years on top of British politics is an incredibly long time.""Claim? A self-made millionaire and devotee of Margaret Thatcher, he is regarded as one of the Conservatives' fastest-rising stars. The Treasury minister-turned-culture secretary became the first of the 2010 intake of MPs to reach cabinet level, and the first Asian male Conservative cabinet minister. He's currently polling well among the Conservative grassroots, who voted him third most preferable leader in ConservativeHome's latest online future leader poll. David Cameron recently said he wants to see a British Asian prime minister in his lifetime.Latest odds: 12/1Claim? Currently holding one of the four great offices of state - foreign secretary - Mr Hammond's name has often cropped up whenever talk of leadership contenders has emerged. He has built up an impressive CV in government since the Conservatives came to power in 2010, being first awarded the job of transport secretary before his promotion to defence secretary where he stayed for three years. He's regarded by many commentators as being a potential candidate for the Tory right. He seems to have work to do among party activists, scoring only 4% in ConservativeHome's future leader poll.Latest odds: 12/1"
2015-04-05,Cereal number,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-magazine-monitor-31962592,"David Cameron has declared he won't seek a third term as prime minister, citing an advertising slogan for Shredded Wheat used in the UK more than 30 years ago. What's its enduring power, asks Justin Parkinson.The hotel kitchen staff are in disbelief. Someone in room 147 has ordered three Shredded Wheat. The maid transports them upstairs to find England cricketer Ian Botham waiting at a table, dressed in full whites.The maid leaves. Botham hides one of the Shredded Wheat under a napkin and winks to camera. Cue music, as the slogan ""Shredded Wheat. Bet you can't eat three"" appears.This advert and others featuring football manager Brian Clough and the actor Richard Kiel, who played Jaws in James Bond films, have not run for some time. Nestle, which owns the brand, says the last probably aired in 1984.But their message seems to have waned little. Telling the BBC he would only serve a limited time in Downing Street, David Cameron said: ""Terms are like Shredded Wheat - two are wonderful but three might just be too many.""The prime minister's reprise was unlikely to be accidental, says Thayne Forbes, joint managing director of the brand-valuation company Intangible Business. ""Everybody would empathise with the view that three Shredded Wheat would probably be too much,"" he says. ""The slogan suggests people shouldn't overdo it. It sounds modest and reasoned.""As marketing goes, it might seem counter-intuitive, as it discourages excessive consumption. But it also sounds honest and unexploitative.Other advertising slogans and themes are in wide use in public and political discourse. Examples include Marmite being a by-word for divisiveness - a ""Marmite person"" is either loved or hated. Cameron has twice referred to Ronseal - the woodcare product that does ""exactly what it says on the tin"". But Shredded Wheat, its best-known slogan having lain dormant for so long, appears to be used less often. The cereal, created in the US in the 1890s, has long been sold as good for the evolving British lifestyle. A newspaper advert in 1902 described it as ""a relief from the monotony of everlasting porridge"", while, by 1943, it was ""an ideal food for all war workers"". The 1980s saw an emphasis on ""simple, honest goodness"", while, in the 2000s, its long heritage and reliability was promoted.""It's a good association for Cameron,"" says Forbes. ""He must have been brought up on it, like lots of other people. It will be great marketing for Shredded Wheat to have the slogan used after so many years, too.""Subscribe to the BBC News Magazine's email newsletter to get articles sent to your inbox"
2015-04-05,Are you 'cosmopolitan'?,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32021853,"The rise of UKIP heralds the emergence of a new divide in British politics, with cosmopolitan voters on one side and non-cosmopolitan ones on the other, argues Jeremy Cliffe.We hear a lot about UKIP these days. The party stole the show at the local and European elections last year, then again in the autumn when it lured two Conservative MPs to defect.  In the past weeks alone there have been three much-discussed television programmes about the party: ""Meet the Ukippers"", ""Farage Fans and UKIP Lovers"" and ""100 Days of UKIP"". At the upcoming general election the party will probably increase its share of seats in Westminster - and will certainly affect the results in dozens of other constituencies by taking votes from the other parties. But ask some of those academics who have been watching UKIP's rise, and they will tell you that it is just one part of a bigger story. We are all used to the left-right divide in politics: a spectrum of different views on how much the government should tax, spend, regulate and otherwise intervene in the economy. But according to Dr Rob Ford of Manchester University, UKIP exists on a different axis, one to do with cultural rather than economic matters. This new political scale is ever more prominent in British political life.Radio 4's Analysis programmeOn the one end of it is what you might call a ""cosmopolitan"" philosophy: a relaxed, liberal attitude to issues concerning national identity (like immigration) and to questions of morality and lifestyle (like gay marriage). On the other end is a ""non-cosmopolitan"" outlook: more nationalist, socially conservative and less comfortable with social change, or in other words the ideological stance often associated with typical UKIP voters. This divide cuts across the left-right scale: there are cosmopolitan and non-cosmopolitan voters in both the Conservative and the Labour camps, which is why UKIP takes support from both.Lots of things are making this cosmopolitanism divide more important. One is that the old class-based, ideological conflict between left and right has declined. Dr James Tilley of Oxford University argues that politicians are partly to blame. The economic philosophies of the Conservative and Labour parties are so similar, he argues, that other, cultural issues are becoming more important. Another factor is the growing gap between the generations: the difference in outlook between the cosmopolitan young and less cosmopolitan, older voters is greater than it was in the past (partly due to the recent rise in levels of university education, which tend to correlate with liberal views). This trend presents the established parties with some difficult questions. As Dr Ford puts it, they ""have to try and deal with this rising value divide, particularly now that UKIP has mobilised it into the political debate."" ""They have to make a move,"" he adds, ""but any move that they make risks making their position worse with one or the other of these groups of voters."" Sound too cosmopolitan, and the parties risk losing supporters to UKIP. Try to ""out-UKIP UKIP"", and they could alienate their younger, more socially liberal supporters. So both are doing the political splits, trying to reconcile the cosmopolitans within their ranks with the non-cosmopolitans. Witness the tortuous attempts by Ed Miliband to sound tough on immigration without sounding too tough. Witness, too, the recent struggles of David Cameron to persuade social conservatives in his party that gay marriage can be an innately conservative institution. In the long-term, this divide will become less problematic. That is because over the years the country will tilt towards the cosmopolitan end of this new spectrum. So says Penny Young of NatCen, the research organisation that conducts the extensive British Social Attitudes survey. Various demographic factors explain this trend. The country as a whole is becoming more accepting of same-sex relationships. Younger voters are more relaxed about things like immigration and national identity than were previous generations when they were young, suggesting that the overall population will tilt in an internationalist direction over time. And ever more parts of the country are acquiring the ethnic and social diversity once confined to the inner cities, a trend that generally makes people more comfortable with immigration. According to Dr Ford the question is therefore: how should the main political parties navigate this period of transition? It would be wrong to simply abandon the swathes of voters at the less cosmopolitan end of the scale; voters who are usually older and more isolated than the average member of the population.Yet the politicians do need to adapt to the changing attitudes of British society and be honest with voters rather than pandering to views that, deep down, they do not share. This quandary may not decide the upcoming general election, but in the established parties savvy strategists with an eye to elections in 2020 and beyond are grappling with it nonetheless. That is a wise move."
2015-04-05,Dudley debate,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32015334,"I met Afzal Amin for the first time on Friday, but I already knew who he was. In Dudley North, the seat he was selected by the Conservatives to fight in the general election, Mr Amin had become hard to avoid. When I first looked at the local newspaper online, the pages were surrounded by ""Amin"" logos in the preferred Tory shade of blue.Not long after we met, he asked me to pose for a photo, snapped by one of his campaign team, and doubtless rapidly tweeted out to followers of the would-be MP.Perhaps no surprise that the man running such a disciplined operation has served in the army and been to Sandhurst. That was very much the message he delivered on Friday, as he addressed school and college pupils at a hustings in Dudley which I'd been invited to chair.There was combative debate, too, not least with his Labour rival, the MP Ian Austin. Both men knew the Dudley contest was critical for their respective parties; Ian Austin held the seat by just over 600 votes in 2010. Just as David Cameron was denied a majority by failing to take seats like this one, so Ed Miliband is unlikely to be in No 10 if Labour loses Dudley North.He was self-confident and fluent. The only obvious mis-step came right at the end, when he interrupted Vicky Duckworth, the Green candidate for the neighbouring seat. She expressed the opinion that politics often seemed to be about men shouting at each other; Mr Amin complained she was engaging in gender bias.A few weeks ago, one Conservative MP who knows him well and respects his talents, said Afzal Amin had warned him of the risks of over-confidence. He thought he risked running before he could walk.Well, he stumbled badly this weekend. Whatever the purpose of his contacts with the English Defence League - and he strongly disputes claims that he wanted them to hold a protest that would then be called off, for which he could then take the credit - the exposure has damaged him and, potentially, the prospects of his party re-taking the seat.In February, the EDL staged a rally against plans for a new mosque in the town. As the Mail on Sunday story makes clear, Afzal Amin pleaded with them beforehand not to hold that demonstration; but it went ahead anyway. It's what happened subsequently which will feature in Tuesday's disciplinary hearing.Over the weekend, I put his defence to a very senior Conservative source - that this was an attempt to broker a compromise in order to bring together a divided community. The arch response: Dudley isn't Kandahar.Nor do I think from my visits to the town, where I'm going to be based for the general election, will people in Dudley appreciate being painted as somewhere riven by racial discord.True, Dudley was the scene of one of England's earliest race riots. But that was in 1962. Although the controversy over replacing the mosque - currently in a converted school and inadequate for the numbers who want to worship there - has been running for a decade, community relations are generally good. Even those who don't want a new mosque didn't want the EDL protestors - nor to be fair the anti-fascist counter-demonstrators who followed them.As for the Conservative Party, the view of the national leadership is that you don't collaborate with the EDL. Not least because the Tories are still struggling to bury some historic baggage in the Black Country: Enoch Powell was an MP in Wolverhampton when he delivered his Rivers of Blood speech about immigration in 1968.Four years before that, there was the notorious election in Smethwick which the Conservatives were accused of winning by wooing white voters with an offensive rhyme suggesting who'd they'd get as a neighbour if they voted Labour. Afzal Amin grew up in Smethwick so he should be aware of that history. He was, until his suspension on Saturday, one of about 17% of Conservative parliamentary candidates who are not white. The party is proud of that, but it's still struggling to translate that into votes.Afzal Amin may believe that he can persuade the party to lift the suspension when he meets party officials on Tuesday. I have my doubts. Even if they accept his defence, will the other parties be so charitable? The allegations would follow him on the campaign trail, and make planned visits by cabinet ministers next to impossible.On Friday, just before the hustings in Dudley began, Afzal Amin gave me his business card. It introduces him as 'prospective member of Parliament Dudley North'. I think I'll keep it; it could yet become a collector's item."

2015-04-06,Bid to change Speaker election rules,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32061097,"A last-minute bid to change the way the Speaker of the House of Commons is elected is to be debated by MPs.Labour criticised the government motion, to be debated on the final day before the dissolution of Parliament, saying the Conservatives were ""trying to play politics with the speakership"".Under the proposals, a secret ballot would decide whether there should be a contested election for the post.MPs currently have to file through the division lobbies to cast their vote.This means it is clear who does or does not back the incumbent as Speaker.Labour's shadow leader of the Commons Angela Eagle raised the party's concerns in the House on Wednesday evening, questioning whether the motion was within parliamentary rules.Current Speaker John Bercow is - technically - one of them, but many Tory MPs have never liked him.They resent his personal style and some believe he is far from impartial in the way he conducts business in the Commons.Attempts by some to force a vote on his resumption as Speaker in 2010 came to nothing. There have been the occasional measured jibes at him from the prime minister. Other Tories reportedly went much further and formed a group whose members had all been reprimanded by him. But the Speaker is a reformer who believes passionately that the people who elect the members, and pay the bills, should come first.The last act of the coalition looks like being an attempt to unseat him. And they are very serious about it.One Tory MP fighting an important marginal seat had been cleared by his party to be away from Parliament but he is now staying for the vote, such is the importance of it.She told Deputy Speaker Lindsay Hoyle: ""It's just come to my attention that the government has tabled a motion for debate on the final day of this Parliament, with no notice whatsoever to myself as shadow leader of the House, proposing changes to the way in which the Speaker of this House is elected.""Procedural matters in this House, with no consultation with the opposition, no consultation with the chair of the committee itself, for debate in only one hour tomorrow.""Mr Hoyle said the motion had been ""rightly or wrongly"" agreed to on Tuesday, saying that ""business of the House is decided by the government, not by the chair.""A spokesman for Commons Leader William Hague said the motion had been tabled as a free hour had opened up in Thursday's business after the House of Lords approved the Modern Slavery Bill.The proposed change would apply when a Speaker wishes to continue in the post after a general election.Under the current rules, if the Speaker's re-appointment is objected to, a division is held, with MPs choosing to back or oppose the Speaker in the division lobbies.The replacement of this method with a secret ballot was suggested in 2010 by a committee of MPs, which said the public method ""can be seen as a deterrent to the House expressing its views honestly"".MPs will now debate whether this change should be made."

2015-04-06,MPs warn on growth of UK jihadists,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32059813,"Not enough is being done to prevent people leaving the UK to join Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, a group of MPs has warned.Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said Britain must win their ""hearts and minds"".The committee's report comes as the BBC launches a database tracking British jihadists in Syria and Iraq. It shows that many people left in clusters from certain UK areas - often due to friendships and peer groups. The MPs' report argued that preventative work with communities, families and international partners was ""vital"" and needs to be a top priority for the Home Office.  ""The number of cases being brought to public attention should ring alarm bells,"" said Labour MP Mr Vaz.  ""This must be a relentless battle for hearts and minds, and without a strong counter-narrative we are in danger of failing to prevent even more departures. We are at the edge of a cliff."" The BBC has been tracking the stories of the men, women, boys and girls who have gone to Syria and Iraq to understand why they go, where they go from and what happens to them. By analysing around 160 profiles, it reveals the way in which people have travelled in clusters - a group of three young friends from Coventry, another group from Portsmouth, drawn out by one person they knew, others in Cardiff linked to people involved in an extremist organisation. Social media might play a part but face-to-face contact appears just as, if not more, important, according to the database.It includes the stories of: The BBC research emphasises the extent to which real-world contacts, rather than just online connections, are often a key driver of radicalisation and intent to travel to Iraq and Syria. Some of the experts who appeared before the Home Affairs Committee also argued the internet was a secondary influence. They said that universities and prisons were among the two most significant places where radicalisation occurred. A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police, which was not aware of the report, said it would have ""welcomed the opportunity"" to have given evidence to the committee and that it planned to look at the report in detail.The disappearance of schoolgirls Shamima Begum, Amira Abase, both 15, and Kadiza Sultana, 16, from east London in February, raised questions as to who could have done more to prevent their departure. After taking evidence from the police and the families of the girls among others, Mr Vaz said their case suffered from a ""lack of immediate action"". He added: ""Schools and the police must inform parents immediately, and work with them even if there is the smallest hint of radicalisation, or a close association with someone who is thought to have been radicalised.""However, the Met Police spokesman defended the speed of the police response to the schoolgirls' disappearance.  He said the committee's criticism was ""misleading"", pointing to the evidence given by both UK and Turkish authorities of ""rapid exchanges"" between the two.The committee's report said there needed to be an advice service which would be a less extreme step than calling the anti-terrorist hotline.The Association of Chief Police Officer's lead officer for the government's anti-terror strategy Prevent, Chief Constable Sir Peter Fahy, agreed that more needed to be done.However, he said the police ""do not have the capacity"" to routinely work with every school in the country.He added: ""The police service will play its part but the prime responsibility for dissuading young people from getting involved in extremist activity has to lie with parents, families and carers.""The committee also pointed to weaknesses in information sharing with airlines and other countries. It said greater care needed to be taken at airport check-in desks when people were travelling to destinations of concern - namely Syria, Somalia, Iraq and Nigeria, as well as neighbouring countries, such as Turkey. The report said police also needed to work faster to alert overseas partners and airlines when there were concerns over individuals.There were signs that some of the girls had followed extremist accounts on social media, the report said.The committee said that social media companies, such as Facebook and Twitter, should be prepared to suspend accounts when there is evidence they are being used to promote violent extremism.  The report also said it was disappointed the Home Office had not implemented a programme for individuals returning to Britain where there is evidence they had fought in Syria.Security officials estimate that some 600 Britons have left the country to join IS - and while around half may have returned, many are still out there - and some have died.  The BBC project includes detailed profiles of individuals which can be searched, based on hometown, age and gender, as well as those who have been convicted in the courts or who are believed to have been killed."

If not, the prince's private letters will either remain confidential, as the sender intended, or they'll be exposed to a large and inquisitive audience.

That will be a clear pledge from us.""He accused Mr Cameron of making an ""out of the blue, panicky"" announcement on VAT that ""no one in Britain will believe"".Labour, which has already announced plans to increase the top rate of income tax and impose a new ""mansion tax"" on high value properties, insists its plans are fully costed and will not require additional tax hikes if it wins May's general election.Mr Miliband began his final head-to-head encounter with Mr Cameron before the election by joking that the PM had ""announced his retirement plans"" - a reference to a BBC interview in which the prime minister said he would not serve a third term if the Tories remained in power.Challenging Mr Cameron to give a ""straight answer to a straight question"", Mr Miliband pressed him on whether he would rule out a rise in VAT after the election, as Labour had done.In response, the prime minister immediately said ""yes"", prompting loud cheers in turn from the Conservative benches. He contrasted what he said was a ""clear promise"" with Labour's unwillingness to rule out a rise in National Insurance.""I answered a very simple question about VAT. I ruled out an increase... straight answer to him, straight question from me. I have ruled out VAT. Will he rule out national insurance contributions. Yes or no?"" Mr Cameron added: ""We all know this is Labour's job tax. This is their tax of choice. This is what they clobber working people, families and enterprises with.""But Mr Miliband responded by saying there was ""only one person who is going to raise taxes on working families and that is him"".He said nobody would believe Mr Cameron on VAT ""because of his extreme spending plans, because his numbers do not add up and because he promised it last time and broke his promise"".Mr Cameron, he added, had broken other promises made before the last election to reduce annual net migration below 100,000 and not to pursue a major structural re-organisation of the NHS, adding that it was ""time for a better plan and time for a Labour government"".But Mr Cameron suggested a future Labour government would result in the ""chaos of economic crisis"", with Ed Miliband being ""held hostage"" by the SNP.The packed session provided a last opportunity for the two men to rally their MPs and set out their arguments before the start of the election campaign next week.Speaking after the exchanges and the other parties' tax pledges, deputy prime minister Nick Clegg said the Lib Dems ""don't need to raise VAT, national insurance or headline rates of income tax or corporation tax either"".""There are other taxes and other tax loopholes that we can increase or close in order to balance the books,"" he said.

2015-04-06,Met police 'had files on MPs in 90s',https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32044580,"A former undercover police officer has told BBC News that Scotland Yard kept intelligence files on MPs during the 1990s. Ex-Special Branch officer Peter Francis says he saw files on 10 Labour MPs which he and others regularly updated. He says he personally gathered information on three MPs as part of his work infiltrating left-wing groups. The MPs named, and Labour, have called for a forthcoming public inquiry into undercover policing to be widened. Mr Francis operated undercover between 1993 and 1997 in the Met's now disbanded Special Demonstration Squad. He was told to embed himself in left-wing groups or causes that were deemed to pose a potential threat to security. He says that during this period he was told to gather intelligence on MPs and their activities if and when they featured in any of his operations. That information, he says, was added to a special pink file that was available for Special Branch officers to read. Between 1990 and 2001, he claims to have personally seen records relating to Diane Abbott, the late Tony Benn, Jeremy Corbyn, the late Bernie Grant, Peter Hain, Harriet Harman, Ken Livingstone, Joan Ruddock, Dennis Skinner and Jack Straw.Four of the group became ministers during Mr Francis's time in Special Branch - including Jack Straw who was home secretary after 1997. ""When I was deployed undercover in the Special Demonstration Squad, any MP that I came across, such as on demonstrations, I would report back on them,"" he said. Mr Francis says that the files not only contained the MPs' publicly-stated political views - but also intelligence on what was going on behind the scenes in the party or their group. He says some of the information would have been things said in private by the MP, depending on how close each undercover officer had been able to get. Mr Francis said that when he first saw the files he understood that each had probably been created before the individual was an MP because of their personal involvement in radical causes or protests.But he added: ""When they became MPs these files carried on. It [was] your duty as an SDS officer to report back any intelligence that you come across. ""I felt that it was OK to report back on MPs,"" he said. ""I used to give myself a pat on the back, thinking 'I have done a good job'. These MPs were spied on and they should know.""""I don't think the police force should be monitoring MPs, full stop. I don't think we have any right to do that at all. It may be justifiable to say that the Security Service should be doing it - but I certainly don't think the police should be doing it.""Scotland Yard has refused to comment on the substance of the claims, but a spokesman said it had not shied away from serious allegations about the SDS. It said that Operation Herne, the internal police investigation into what happened in the unit, remained an ongoing investigation.""Operation Herne maintains that without speaking to Peter Francis it is simply not possible to fully investigate allegations he makes,"" said a spokesman. ""Operation Herne remains very willing to engage with him.""Mr Francis said that he has refused to speak to Operation Herne because he fears being interviewed under caution as a suspect, rather than a whistleblower. Scotland Yard told the BBC that Operation Herne detectives would be prepared to speak to him as a witness. He has, however, spoken to Mark Ellison QC who reviewed allegations about the SDS for the Home Secretary Theresa May - prompting her to launch a statutory inquiry. He says he will appear before those hearings. Peter Hain, who was a leader of the anti-apartheid movement in the late 1960s and 70s and became an MP in 1991, said he now wants full answers from Scotland Yard. ""I was deeply disturbed to find that files were still being kept by the Special Branch while I and others were serving Members of Parliament,"" he said. ""That is constitutionally an outrage. It infringes the sovereignty of Parliament. ""I want to see the home secretary widen the scope of the inquiry into the SDS to look specifically at the surveillance of MPs and the fact that there were active files on us while we were serving Members of Parliament. ""This should never have happened and it should have been reported and properly authorised - and we don't know whether it was.""Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper echoed the call for the inquiry to be widened in light of what she described as ""extremely serious and disturbing allegations"".""While undercover policing remains a crucial tool in combating serious and organised crime it must not be abused,"" she said.""There have now been a series of serious allegations about undercover policing - ranging from the treatment of Stephen Lawrence's family to police having long-term inappropriate relationships. ""We called some time ago for much stronger oversight of undercover policing and it is also vital to get to the truth about what has happened."" Mrs May announced earlier this month that Lord Justice Pitchford would lead the inquiry into the SDS allegations - but the precise shape of that inquiry is not yet clear.A Home Office spokesman said the review by Mark Ellison QC had unearthed ""serious historical failings"". ""That is why the Home Secretary established a public inquiry to thoroughly investigate undercover policing and the operation of the Special Demonstration Squad. ""Lord Justice Pitchford will consult interested parties to the inquiry over the coming months on setting the terms of reference, with a view to publishing these at the end of July.""Undercover policing is an essential tactic in the fight against crime but to improve the public's confidence in undercover work we must ensure there is no repeat of these failings in the future."""
2015-04-06,NHS problems worst 'since 1990s',https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/health-32057948,"Services in the NHS in England are deteriorating in a way not seen since the early 1990s, according to a leading health think tank. The King's Fund review said waiting times for A&E, cancer care and routine operations had all started getting worse, while deficits were growing.It said such drops in performance had not been seen for 20 years.But the think tank acknowledged the NHS had done as well as could be expected, given the financial climate.Professor John Appleby, chief economist at the King's Fund, which specialises in health care policy, said: ""The next government will inherit a health service that has run out of money and is operating at the very edge of its limits. ""There is now a real risk that patient care will deteriorate as service and financial pressures become overwhelming.""He said in terms of how standards were slipping - not how low they had reached - the situation was the worst it had been since the ""early 1990s"".The report noted much of the deterioration has happened in the second-half of the Parliament with many measures of performance being maintained in the first few years.It said the next government had to address the funding situation, adding the extra £8bn a year NHS England says is needed by 2020, was the ""minimum"" that would be required.The report - a review of performance this Parliament - highlights a range of problems as well as achievements. These include:The report is the second part of the King's Fund pre-election review of the NHS this Parliament.Last month it warned the coalition government's reforms of the health service had been ""damaging and distracting"".The King's Fund report should make worrying reading. The reference to the 1990s conjures up images of - for the NHS at least - a bygone era. The think tank's point was not that waiting times had reached the level they were at then, rather that this is the first time in two decades of almost continuous improvement that there has been a sustained drop in performance.In many ways, that had to happen. Services cannot keep getting better for ever. Nonetheless, the findings are crystal clear: the NHS is at a critical juncture. But what is less easy to determine is to what extent the coalition's policies have contributed to the difficulties.The think tank has already provided a critical analysis of the government's reforms - and when pushed, acknowledged the health service may have been ""in better shape"" if they had not happened.But the more significant issue for the health of the health service this Parliament has been the squeeze on finances. Even though the budget has been increased, it has felt more like a cut to many because demands have risen so quickly.On this though, the King's Fund accepted that the government's hands were tied. Given the state of the economy, ministers did as much as they could have.Read more from NickRoyal College of Nursing general secretary Peter Carter said politicians needed to take note of the warnings made by the King's Fund.""Morale is low, and more and more staff are being made sick with stress because of the intolerable pressure they are under,"" he added. Katherine Murphy, of the Patients Association, said: ""The findings echo what we are hearing on a daily basis on our helpline. It is clear to the public that the future of the NHS is one of the most important issues facing the nation and it should be a central issue in the election campaign.""Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham said: ""Five years ago David Cameron stood on a promise to protect the NHS. This report provides authoritative proof that he has broken that promise.""But a Department of Health spokesman said: ""As the King's Fund says, the NHS has 'performed well in the face of huge challenges', but if we are to continue to invest in the NHS going forward it needs to be backed by a strong economy.""

2015-04-06,SNP 'could block Tory government',https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32045419,"The SNP would block a minority Conservative government by voting down its Queen's Speech if it holds the post-election balance of power, its former leader Alex Salmond has said.Mr Salmond said the move could bring down the government if Labour joined in, with David Cameron ""locked out"".The Conservatives accused him of ""trying to sabotage the democratic will of the British people"".Labour has called his balance of power prediction ""bluster and bluff"".In recent days Mr Salmond, who is bidding to become a Westminster MP at the 7 May general election, has claimed his party could ""hold the power"" in a hung Parliament and would be able to influence the Budget of a minority Labour government.This was dismissed by Labour leader Ed Miliband, who has ruled out a formal coalition with the Scottish nationalists.The SNP currently has six MPs at Westminster, but recent opinion polls suggest its share could increase dramatically at the general election.James Cook, BBC News Scotland correspondentIf the Conservatives attempt to form a minority government and enough MPs vote against their Queen's Speech the administration would fall at the first hurdle and the leader of the opposition would have a shot at forming a government.That's how parliamentary democracy works in the event of a hung Parliament.And yet the Conservatives are saying that by planning to vote against a government he opposes Alex Salmond has ""confirmed he would sabotage the democratic will of the British people in order to make Ed Miliband prime minister"".It is part of their continuing attempt to portray Mr Miliband as a weak leader whose strings are being pulled by Mr Salmond.This kind of language causes despair among Tories north of the border who fear that the party in London is waltzing into an SNP trap.They know that many voters in Scotland will read the phrase ""democratic will of the British people"" and hear ""democratic will of the English people"".Because, if it is illegitimate for Scottish MPs, from whatever party, to vote against one government and support another in the British parliament, then what, voters may ask, is the point of the union?Who is dancing to Mr Salmond's tune now?Mr Salmond, the former Scottish first minister, told the New Statesman that in the event of a hung Parliament, a minority Conservative government would have to ""go straight effectively for a vote of confidence - usually the Queen's Speech, although it could be otherwise, of course - and we'd be voting against.""If David Cameron lost this vote, he said, there would be a two-week period for another government to be formed.BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said Mr Salmond had ""hardened his anti-Conservative rhetoric"" in the interview.A Conservative spokesman said:  ""Alex Salmond has confirmed he would sabotage the democratic will of the British people in order to make Ed Miliband prime minister. ""That would mean chaos for Britain, with weak Ed Miliband dancing to Alex Salmond's tune.""He said the ""only way to keep Britain together"" was to vote Conservative.Mr Salmond's latest comments come after Mr Miliband said the only people writing a future Labour Budget would be himself and shadow chancellor Ed Balls.Speaking in Clydebank on Monday, he added: ""It's not going to be Alex Salmond - not in a million years."""
2015-04-06,MPs criticise 'lack of EU debate',https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32045290,"The government's ""failure"" to let MPs debate EU legislation is ""deplorable"", a Parliamentary committee says.The European Scrutiny Committee said ministers had refused to schedule debates on issues such as free movement and the EU's Budget.It also said BBC coverage of EU matters should be ""improved substantially"".The government said the number of EU debates had doubled since 2009-10, while the BBC said its coverage was ""extensive and impartial"".The cross-party committee's role includes scrutinising EU documents and recommending the most important for debate in the House of Commons.Its report said in the period covering most of the 2014-15 financial year there were three debates on the floor of the House, compared with 12 in 2013-14.It also pointed out that not a single debate had taken place during a nine-month period, between 9 June 2014 and 9 March 2015.""The government's collective failure to schedule so many debates on EU documents over the past year is deplorable, and is a discourtesy to this committee and to all members of the House,"" the MPs said.Prime Minister David Cameron has sought to rally support from other EU leaders for his plans to curb welfare payments to European migrants ahead of a referendum on the UK's membership if he wins the general election.The committee said the government's ""cavalier"" approach was ""at odds with UK ministers' claims in their speeches across the EU about the role of national parliaments"".The Foreign Office said the government was committed to a ""strong EU scrutiny system that enables Parliament to hold it to account for the decisions taken in Brussels"".It added: ""We have made good on our commitment to raise standards by doubling the number of Europe debates on the floor of the House since 2009-10.""This government has also increased by around a fifth since 2010 the number of EU proposals that have been scrutinised and cleared by Parliament before being agreed in Brussels.""The committee has also been examining the BBC's coverage of European issues, taking evidence from director general Lord Hall and head of news James Harding earlier this month.During that appearance, Lord Hall said the desire for balanced output ""ran deep"" within the BBC and he believed that this was being achieved.Mr Harding said if the public was going to trust the BBC to report on politicians impartially it had to be clear that BBC journalists weren't ""asked by politicians to come and account for what they do and in effect do the bidding of those politicians"".But the committee said it was ""concerned about the manner in which the BBC treats EU issues"", calling for coverage to be ""improved substantially"".It suggested coverage did not reflect all sides of the debate on the European Union, and more analysis was needed. Its chairman, Conservative MP Sir William Cash, said the BBC had ""very particular obligations"" to be impartial and to ""educate and inform"".He added:  ""We do not believe this is currently being achieved in the context of the BBC's EU coverage.""A BBC spokesman said the corporation provided extensive and impartial coverage of European and Parliamentary issues, and it would be a breach of the corporation's independence if a committee of MPs instructed the BBC on its coverage."
2015-04-06,Lobbyists must 'conform' with rules,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32047992,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe woman in charge of the government's new register of lobbyists has said she expects the industry to ""conform"" with the statutory system. Speaking ahead of the register's launch, Alison White conceded a lot of lobbyists would not be listed on it.But she said her job was to make sure the rules were implemented and she would do so with ""extreme verve and vigour.""But one critic of the register said it was ""fake"" and full of ""loopholes"".Lobbyists are companies or individuals paid to influence government decisions.The coalition promised to introduce a statutory register of lobbyists when it came to power in 2010, and legislation was passed last year, with ministers saying the move would help clean up politics.However, the new register will only cover consultant lobbyists and will not apply to lobbyists working ""in-house"" for companies or organisations.A person or company will only need to be registered if they are contacting a government minister or permanent secretary in a government department - leading to criticism it will not come close to reflecting the scale or nature of lobbying that goes on across Whitehall.But Ms White, who is independent of the government, said her task was to implement the law as it stood not to question the powers she had been given. ""We are having something that has never been in place before,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""This is a statutory register. The industry tells me it is a professional industry. I expect them to conform with the legislation. It is my job to make sure they do so.""Ms White, who was appointed as the registrar of consultant lobbyists in September, acknowledged the register would not indicate different ""levels of lobbying"".""The legislation was quite narrowly drafted to address a particular issue, which was that it was not always particularly clear, when ministers were being lobbied, who the client of the lobbyist was. That is what the register was set up to do,"" she said.She added: ""This will give anyone who wishes to access the register the opportunity to be able to see who is lobbying and being paid for it and who their clients are. That is the main information the register will contain.""If a lobbyist sets out to influence government policy in some way, they would have to be registered. If they are not registered, then they would not be conforming. They have to go on the register before they lobby.""Ms White said last month that the register would not have any entries on its launch day but she had received more than ""20 expressions of interest"" about joining and companies and individuals might be required to sign up retrospectively.Potential registrants will be able to log on and create an account to file an ""information return"".But Tamasin Cave, from the Alliance for Lobbying Transparency coalition, said ""hardly anyone"" in the industry would be covered by the provisions of the new law. ""You have a huge commercial lobbying industry, and very few of them will have to sign up,"" she told Today.""The second flaw is that it won't show the interaction between lobbyists and government, and that is what a register is for.""It is to show the activity - who is discussing what with whom, but this shows nothing of this interaction. It is a fake register."""
2015-04-06,Car smoking ban MSP welcomes backing,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-south-scotland-32055226,"The Liberal Democrat MSP behind a bill to ban smoking in cars when children are present has welcomed the support of the Scottish government.South of Scotland MSP Jim Hume launched the members' bill in December.The government said it was ""very supportive"" of the principles of the bill, but changes could be needed to make it ""workable"".Motorists could potentially be fined £100 for breaching the rule if it becomes law.Mr Hume lodged draft proposals for a bill last May calling for a ban in Scotland on smoking in private vehicles when children under 18 were present.He said he was ""over the moon"" at the news the Scottish government would endorse the Smoking Prohibition (Children in Motor Vehicles) (Scotland) Bill.He said: ""With cross-party support and the support of many third sector organisations, there is every chance that this could be in place in the next year.""Eighty-four per cent of the 160 responses to my consultation were positive and people from across Scotland have expressed their support for the move.""The bill is about guaranteeing that children in Scotland can have the freedom to go on and lead healthy lives if they choose to.""I look forward to working with MSPs from all parties as the bill progresses.""Public Health Minister Maureen Watt said the Scottish government had considered including the measure in its Public Health Bill, but instead decided to support Mr Hume's proposals.She said: ""As with any bill, as it goes through the scrutiny process, there may be amendments and improvements to strengthen the legislation and ensure it is fit for purpose. ""But we believe that the underpinning principles are strong, and that is why I am pleased to support it.""Scottish Labour and a wide range of health organisations have backed his proposals.But the Scottish Conservatives have reservations about how the bill would work in practice.The party's health spokesman Jackson Carlaw said: ""While Scottish Conservatives support any moves which would protect young people from hazardous second hand smoke we have concerns as to how this would be enforced.""It would be a better use of resources to conduct a public awareness campaign similar to that which is being proposed by the government in Wales.""We will be watching this campaign in order to ascertain what lessons may be learned and what approaches may be adopted in Scotland.""Anti-smoking campaigners welcomed the Scottish government's backing for Mr Hume's bill.ASH Scotland's chief executive Sheila Duffy said: ""It is another public health initiative that can help Scotland move forward with its ambition to achieve a tobacco-free generation in 20 years' time.""It is popular with the public and will bring Scotland into line with upcoming legislation in England and Wales.""We believe it can be effectively enforced and that having the legislation focus on cars with children bypasses concerns over interference in people's private lives.""Jim Hume must be congratulated for taking the initiative on this proposal and for all the hard work he and his team have done to bring this important measure forward.""But Simon Clark, director of the smokers' group Forest, said the bill was ""legislation for legislation's sake"".He said: ""Smoking in cars carrying children is inconsiderate. The overwhelming majority of smokers know that and don't do it.""The very small number that do will carry on regardless because the law will be difficult, if not impossible, to enforce.""Education has to be better than legislation but the government prefers gesture politics and the big stick."""
2015-04-06,Candidate quits over UKIP MEP remark,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32038485,"A UKIP election candidate has quit the party over comments made by the party's only Scottish MEP about a Scottish government minister.Tim Wilson has decided not to stand in South Northamptonshire after David Coburn MEP compared Humza Yousaf to convicted terrorist Abu Hamza.Mr Coburn has apologised for the remarks, saying it was a ""joke"".A spokesman for UKIP said Mr Wilson had failed to emphasise local issues in his general election campaign.UKIP leader Nigel Farage said Mr Coburn's remarks were a ""joke in poor taste"" but he would not be taking any action against him.But Mr Wilson said he was disillusioned with the party over the ""racist jibes"" and has decided to stand down.He told BBC Scotland he was appalled by Mr Coburn's comments about Mr Yousaf and frustrated by the inaction of the party's leadership on the issue.  He said David Coburn had produced ""what I can only describe as an Islamaphobic insult, and that's simply not acceptable"".  Mr Wilson added: ""Of course he went on and apologised.  I think, frankly, that if you are in a position of power you have to be able to control what ideas emerge from your head and how they get to your mouth and, in fact, you shouldn't have those ideas in the first place.  ""But the real issue is that when Mr Farage was asked what he thought about this he dismissed this as a joke.  ""I don't think this is a joke. I think this is something very serious.  It may not be that this man intended to cause offence but we aren't interested in what his intentions are.  We are interested in the effect what he says has on other people and the effect is catastrophic, it's appalling and I've resigned.""In his resignation letter, Mr Wilson said he had been ""systematically gagged by the party whip"" and forbidden to speak about Islam favourably. A spokesman for UKIP said Mr Wilson had failed to put more emphasis on local issues in his campaign.He said: ""Whilst we had initially been optimistic about Tim Wilson's abilities as a candidate, it became obvious in recent weeks that he was out of his depth in representing our party in the way we would expect. ""Mr Wilson had clearly misunderstood the expectations that UKIP place on all of its candidates. Principal amongst those is focusing on issues that are relevant to local voters. UKIP put huge emphasis on local issues and Mr Wilson was unwilling to follow UKIP guidelines in this respect.""Last week MSPs at the Scottish Parliament unanimously condemned the remarks made by Mr Coburn during a newspaper interview.MSPs were debating a motion celebrating Scotland's diverse communities.The president of the European Parliament, Martin Schulz, condemned the remarks, saying they were ""not worthy of any elected member"". But a spokesman for the president said he could not act on remarks made outside parliament.The move comes just days after another candidate, Jonathan Stanley, quit in protest at the ""racist filth"" in UKIP. Mr Stanley, who was due to stand in the Cumbrian seat of Westmorland and Lonsdale, was the party's former head of policy in Scotland."

2015-04-06,Manifesto watch,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-29642613,"Political parties are putting together their manifestos for May's general election. Here's a guide to where they currently stand on the issues voters say they care about most (according to pollsters IPSOS Mori).ImmigrationConservatives:  David Cameron wants to make migrants wait four years before they can claim certain benefits, such as tax credits, Universal Credit, or get access to social housing. He wants to stop migrants from claiming child benefit for dependents living outside the UK, and remove those that have failed to find work after six months. Mr Cameron has promised to put reform of EU free movement rules at the heart of his renegotiation of Britain's relationship with the EU. He has ruled out a temporary cap on migrant numbers or an ""emergency brake"" on EU freedom of movement rules - ideas both mooted in recent months, saying this would be less ""effective"" than reducing the incentives for people to come to the UK. The party has a continuing goal to bring net immigration down to below 100,000 people a year (it currently stands at 243,000).Labour: ""Stronger"" border controls to tackle illegal immigration with ""proper"" entry and exit checks. ""Smarter"" targets to reduce low-skilled migration but ensure university students and high-skilled workers are not deterred. Employment agencies who only recruit abroad will be outlawed while the fines for employing illegal immigrants will be increased.Lib Dems: Reintroduce exit checks at borders, so the government can identify people who are overstaying their visa. Will require all new claimants for Jobseekers Allowance to have their English language skills assessed, with JSA then being conditional on attending language courses for those whose English is poor. Ensure that EU migrants have to ""earn"" their entitlement to benefits.SNP: Allow the devolved government to have control over immigration to Scotland, and introduce a Canadian-style earned citizenship system to attract highly-skilled immigrants.Plaid Cymru: Oppose a points-based system. Support the right of asylum seekers to work in Wales while they wait for status decisions to be made. Lobby the Westminster government to ensure that they shut ""detention"" centres.UKIP: Introduce an Australian-style points policy, used to select migrants with the skills and attributes needed to work in the country - covering people from inside and outside the EU. Bring net immigration down to 50,000 people a year. Priority lanes for UK passport holders. Increase UK border staff by 2,500. Tougher English language tests for migrants seeking permanent residence. Opt out of the Dublin treaty to allow the UK to return asylum seekers to other EU countries without considering their claim. Anyone who currently has the legal right to live, work, or study in the UK would not face deportation in the event of the country's withdrawal from the EU.Greens:  Progressively reduce UK immigration controls. Migrants illegally in the UK for over five years will be allowed to remain unless they pose a serious danger to public safety. More legal rights for asylum seekers.Taxes and the economyConservatives: Eradicate the deficit by 2018 and secure an overall budget surplus by 2019-20. Achieve this by spending cuts, not tax rises, while raising NHS spending. An income tax cut for 30 million people by 2020. Tax would start to kick in at £12,500 a year, instead of £10,500. This will cost £5.6bn. The higher tax rate, 40%, would start at £50,000 instead of £41,900, again by 2020, at a cost of £1.6bn. This will be paid for through £25bn in additional spending cuts and economic growth. No increases in VAT.Labour: Get the current budget into surplus and the national debt falling ""as soon as possible in the next parliament"". No additional borrowing for new spending. Reintroduce the 50p top rate of income tax for earnings over £150,000.  Cut income tax for 24 million people by bringing back the 10p rate, paid for by scrapping the Married Couples' Tax Allowance. Bring in a ""mansion tax"" on properties worth over £2m, to raise £1.2bn. A tax on bankers' bonuses. A 5% pay cut for every government minister. Push for UK overseas territories to be put on an international blacklist if they refuse to co-operate with a drive against tax avoidance. No increases in VAT or National Insurance contributions.Lib Dems: Raise the personal allowance - the point at which you start paying income tax - to £11,000 in April 2016 and then to £12,500 by 2020. ""Strict new fiscal rules"" to ensure the deficit has gone by April 2018, with the wealthy contributing the most. The Lib Dems invented the ""mansion tax"" but in contrast to Labour have set out how it would operate - along similar lines to council tax bands. There are also Lib Dem plans to increase capital gains tax - paid on profits from second homes or shares - from 28% to 35%. Impose an additional 8% rate of corporation tax on UK banks to raise an extra £1bn a year to help pay off the deficit.SNP: Oppose UK plans in the Infrastructure Bill which will allow oil and gas drilling and hydraulic fracturing beneath people's homes without consent. Invest in offshore wind farming. Support an international bank tax and limits to industry bonuses.Plaid Cymru: Build a Green Skills Construction College, specialising in green energy. Establish a publicly-owned energy company. Establish a publicly-owned Bank of Wales business investment bank. Enforce a living wage. Give devolved nations an equal say in institutions that affect everyone's lives, such as the Bank of England.UKIP: Increase the personal allowance to the level of full-time minimum wage earnings, about £13,500, by 2020. Abolish inheritance tax. Introduce a 35% income tax rate between £42,285 and £55,000, at which point the 40% rate becomes payable. Set up a Treasury Commission to design a turnover tax on large businesses. Cut foreign aid budget by £9bn a year. Scrap HS2. Save £8bn a year in membership fees by leaving the EU.  Lower the VAT rate charged on restorations to listed buildings.Greens: People earning more than £100,000 a year would pay 50% income tax. Wealth tax of 1% to 2% on people worth £3m or more. Renationalise the railways and energy companies. Scrap HS2. Allow councils to impose extra business rates on out-of-town supermarkets to fund small local businesses. Crackdown on tax avoidance by multinationals. Allow ""the current dependence on economic growth to cease, and allow zero or negative growth to be feasible without individual hardship"". Commit Britain to a ""zero carbon"" future. Cut rail and bus fares by an average of 10%. Enforce a cap on bankers' bonuses.The NHSConservatives:  Chancellor George Osborne says he will put an extra £2bn into frontline health services across the UK, which he described as a ""down payment"" on a plan drawn up by NHS bosses calling for an extra £8bn a year above inflation by 2020. In England, everyone would be able to see a GP seven days a week by 2020. Recruit 5,000 more doctors.Labour:  Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said Labour would commit an extra £2.5bn a year above Mr Osborne's plan. The money will come from three sources - a new ""mansion"" tax, clamping down on tax avoidance by big corporations and a new tax on tobacco companies. Patients in England would get a GP appointment within 48 hours and would not have to wait longer than a week for cancer tests and results. Scrap the Health and Social Care Act and end ""creeping privatisation"" of the NHS.  Integrate health and social care services into a system of ""whole-person care"". Give greater priority to mental health services. Replace the Cancer Drugs Fund in England when it runs out in 2016 with a £330m fund to improve access to innovative cancer drugs, surgery and radiotherapy. Recruit 5,000 more healthcare workers to help patients stay in their homes and introduce new safety checks to identify people at risk of hospitalisation. Prioritise child mental health by increasing the proportion of the mental health budget spent on children.Lib Dems: An extra £1bn for the NHS every year, to be funded by - amongst other things - making higher earners pay more tax on their shares. Half of this will go towards mental health. Ensure that spending on the NHS rises in line with growth in the economy. People who need therapy for conditions such as depression will be guaranteed treatment within 18 weeks. For young patients experiencing psychosis for the first time treatment will be provided within two weeks of being referred by a GP. This is all going to happen from April, with more mental health targets to follow if the Lib Dems return to government. Wants a cross-party review of the future of NHS funding.SNP: Reduce the number of senior managers in the NHS by 25% over the next parliament. Streamline the work of health boards. Real terms increases in year-on-year NHS spending.Plaid Cymru: Recruit 1,000 extra doctors to the Welsh NHS over two terms of a Plaid government. Offer financial incentives for recruiting doctors to areas and specialisms where there are, or are predicted to be, shortages. Encourage innovation and attract more research funding, in part by increasing research and development funding as government finance allows. Improve training for postgraduate doctors and stop them being used to ""plug gaps"" in staff rotas. More recruitment from within the EU to fill vacancies and using international doctors to staff the NHS while a new generation of Welsh doctors are trained.UKIP: An extra £3bn per year in NHS funding paid for by quitting the EU and through ""middle management"" cuts. Keep NHS free at the point of delivery. Stop any further use of PFI, and encourage local authorities to buy out their PFI contracts early where it is affordable to do so. Ensure all visitors and migrants who have been here for fewer than five years have NHS-approved medical insurance as a condition of entry to UK, with £200m of the £2bn saved to be spent on ending hospital parking charges in England. Bring back state-enrolled nurses and return powers to matrons. Monitor and Care Quality Commission to be replaced with elected county health boards. Stop spending £90m a year on gastric band and breast enhancement operations.Greens: Funding to be diverted away from centralised facilities towards community healthcare, illness prevention and health promotion.  Stop privatisation. Abolish prescription charges. Dedicated NHS Tax to go direct to the health service. Ban proactive recruitment of non-British NHS staff from overseas. A complete ban on the promotion of tobacco and alcohol products, including sponsorship.Security, defence and foreign affairsConservatives: Hold a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU by 2017, after negotiating the return of some powers from Brussels. Protect foreign aid budget. Replace Trident.Labour:  Push for reform of European Union and prevent Britain from ""sleepwalking"" towards exit. Commit in law to holding a Strategic Defence and Security Review every 5 years. Outlaw discrimination and abuse of Armed Forces personnel.Lib Dems: Campaign to reduce the number of Trident nuclear submarines. Push for greater European Union efficiency. SNP: Oppose nuclear weapons and push for removal of Trident submarines from Scotland. In 2010, proposed a Scottish Centre for Reconciliation and Conflict Resolution, to promote peaceful alternatives to armed conflict. Maintain 0.7% commitment to foreign aid. Enhanced role for Scotland within the UK in Europe, particularly in fisheries policy.Plaid Cymru: Honour commitment of 0.7% of budget used for foreign aid. Campaign for cancellation of developing countries' debts. Support the Fair Trade movement. Support the 'Tobin' or 'Robin hood' tax as a means of encouraging more responsibility and stability in the global markets. Reform the IMF and World Bank in order to improve regulation and accountability. Continue membership of the EU, but campaign for democratic reform. Support minority nations and minority language speakers around the world. Pass a Military Wellbeing Act to promote and safeguard the physical and mental health and wellbeing of military personnel.UKIP:  Leave the European Union. Remove the passports of any person who has gone to fight for a terrorist organisation and deport anyone who has committed a terrorist act. Cut foreign aid budget by £9bn. Create a Veterans Department to look after the interests of ex-service men and women.Greens: Referendum on Britain's EU membership. Want reform of EU to hand powers back to local communities. Boost overseas aid to 1% of GDP within 10 years. Scrap Britain's nuclear weapons. Take the UK out of NATO unilaterally. End the so-called ""special relationship"" between the UK and the US.  Stop EU-US free trade deal TTIP. JobsConservatives: Create three million apprenticeships to be paid for by benefit cuts.Labour: Guarantee a job for under 25s unemployed for over a year and adults unemployed for more than two years. As many young people to go on an apprenticeship as currently go to university by 2025. Create a million new high technology, green jobs by 2025. Ban ""exploitative"" zero hour contracts.Lib Dems: An extra £1 an hour for the lowest paid apprentices. Campaign to create a million more jobs.SNP: Introduce gender quotas on public boards. Living wage ""a central priority"" in all Scottish government contracts. Continue the 'small business bonus'.Plaid Cymru: Provide rates relief for small businesses. Increase the number and value of contracts from Welsh public bodies that go to firms within Wales.UKIP: Allow firms to offer jobs to British workers first ""without the fear of being sued for discrimination"".Greens: A national energy conservation scheme to create thousands of new jobs. The party wants to create ""sustainable jobs"" and promotes more local production of food and goods.Education Conservatives: Protect England's schools budget - from reception entry at age four or five to the end of GCSEs at 16 - in cash terms although funding per pupil will not keep pace with inflation. Pre-school and post 16 education not ring fenced. Convert up to 3,500 more schools judged by Ofsted to ""require improvement"" into academies. ""War on illiteracy and innumeracy"". State primary schools in England that repeatedly failed to have a proportion of year-six pupil pass times tables and writing tests be forced to become academies, or have sponsorship replaced if already an academy. Opposed to giving votes to 16 and 17-year-olds for UK-wide general elections and local elections in England.Labour:  Increase the overall education budget in England, including schools, nurseries, Sure Start and provision for 16-to 18-year-olds, by at least the rate of inflation, although per-pupil funding is not specifically protected, meaning some of the increase will be eaten up by rising pupil numbers. Parents of primary school children would be guaranteed childcare from 8am to 6pm. The amount of free childcare for three and four year olds would be increased from 15 to 25 hours a week. Compulsory sex and relationship education in all schools. Refuse to grant business rate relief to independent schools unless they can show a ""meaningful impact"" on state schools through a new School Partnership Standard, for example by lending teaching staff or assisting in university admissions procedures. Committed to extending the franchise to 16 and 17-year-olds in elections across the UK. Double the number of Sure Start childcare places to more than 118,000. Tighten up the rules on primary school class sizes to ensure they do not have more than 30 pupils.Lib Dems: Protect the education budget from cuts. Guarantee qualified teachers and a core curriculum set by independent experts, as well as compulsory sex education, in all state schools including academies and free schools. More money for disadvantaged school children and free childcare for all two year olds. A two-thirds discount on all local bus fares for young people aged 16-21. Supports lowering the voting age to 16 in all UK elections.SNP: Guaranteed free 30 hours of childcare a week for three and four-year-olds in Scotland, up from 16 hours. Maintain lack of tuition fees at Scottish universities, and offer financial support in grants and loans to students. Continue to build and refurbish schools. Lower voting age to 16 in all UK elections.Plaid Cymru: Introduce a compulsory modern foreign language GCSE in secondary schools and the teaching of modern foreign languages in primary schools. Look at ways to strengthen the teaching of Welsh history and culture. Oppose foundation schools, academies and free schools. Look at moving from a per-pupil funding mechanism to a funding model based on the catchment area. Will not support any further increases in tuition fees for higher education students, and will seek the abolition of tuition fees as and when public finances allow. Supports lowering the voting age to 16 for elections to the Welsh Assembly and the UK Parliament.UKIP: More grammar schools. Scrap sex education for children aged under seven. Scrap tuition fees for students from poorer backgrounds who take degree courses in the sciences, technology, maths or engineering. Greater emphasis on vocational education with new Apprenticeship Qualification Option. School governing boards must be made up of at least 30% parents of children at the school. Allow universities to charge same amount for EU students as non-EU students.Greens: End performance related pay for teachers. Replace Ofsted with an independent National Council for Educational Excellence. Bring Free Schools and Academies into local authority control.

Withdraw Jobseeker's Allowance from young people after six months unless they take part in ""community projects"". And 18 to 21-year-olds wouldn't be entitled to housing benefit. Ban on zero-hours contracts which stop people getting work elsewhere. Raise the personal allowance - the point at which you start paying income tax - to £11,000 in April 2016 and then to £12,500 by 2020, which means that if you work on minimum wage for 30 hours you will pay no income tax. Young people out of work, education or training for six months will have to do unpaid community work to get benefits. This will apply to about 50,000 18 to 21-year-olds. Universal benefits for pensioners, such as free bus passes, TV licences for the over 75s and the winter fuel allowance. will once again be protected. Labour: Freeze energy prices until 2017. Increase in the minimum wage from £6.50-an-hour to £8-an-hour by 2020. Rises in child benefit capped at 1% for the first two years of the next parliament. Winter fuel allowance would be withdrawn from the wealthiest pensioners. Repeal what the government calls the spare room subsidy, dubbed the ""bedroom tax"" by Labour.  A million interest-free loans to help people insulate their homes. Rail fares would be capped. Double the amount of paid paternity leave available to new fathers from two to four weeks, and increase statutory paternity pay to £260 a week.Lib Dems: Raise the personal allowance - the point at which you start paying income tax - to £11,000 in April 2016 and then to £12,500 by 2020 (the Conservatives are promising the same thing). Nick Clegg has said he would not accept Conservative plans to freeze working-age benefits without taxing the rich too. He hasn't said he would block welfare cuts altogether. Withdraw eligibility for the Winter Fuel Payment and free TV Licence from pensioners on the 40% rate of income tax. A ""yellow card"" system to deal with benefit claimants breaking the rules, rather than imposing sanctions without warning.SNP: Oppose cuts to in-work benefits. Support moves to extend paternity leave. Introduce a maximum combined withdrawal rate for benefits and reforms to employment support allowance and cold weather payments. Protect policies such as concessionary travel for older Scots.Plaid Cymru: Move away from complex and expensive means testing for child-related benefits. Continue to campaign for the introduction of a living pension during the period of the next parliament for those aged 80 and over. UKIP: Only pay child benefit for the first two children for new claimants. Increase the Carers' Allowance to the same level as Jobseekers' Allowance (JSA) and pay a higher rate of JSA if you've been in work and already made tax and National Insurance contributions. Prevent anyone taking up permanent residence in Britain unless they're able to support themselves and any dependents they bring with them for at least five years and stop them receiving benefits. Stop paying child benefit for children who don't live in Britain. Scrap what UKIP calls the ""detested bedroom tax"". Boost ""credit unions"".Greens: The party backs a Citizen's Income, a fixed amount of £72 income a week to be paid to every individual, whether they are in work or not, to be funded by higher taxes on the better off and green levies.  But in the short-term it would increase the minimum wage to £10 by 2020. Ban zero hours contracts. Axe the ""bedroom tax"". Abolish the work capability assessment and restore the level of the former disability living allowance. Scrap the government's welfare cap, which limits the maximum amount a household can claim annually to £26,000 a year."

2015-04-06,Elephant trap?,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32047998,"The campaign has not even got under way, yet in the space of a couple of hours we have now been treated to not only one election pledge, but to two. The prime minister ruled out raising VAT if re-elected - while Labour said National Insurance contributions wouldn't go up.Usually politicians fudge the question of tax rises.  When he was leader of the opposition David Cameron himself said ""we have no need to raise taxes"" - before hiking up VAT after polling day.Famously, John Major said he had ""no plans"" to put up the sales tax -  before his chancellor did just that.And when he appeared in front of the cross-party Treasury committee of MPs on Tuesday, the current chancellor seemed to be continuing that tradition.  Under repeated questioning, George Osborne said: ""The policies we have do not involve a VAT rise.""That formulation appeared to give him not so much wriggle room, but an entire wriggle mansion.Labour assumed their campaign warning of further VAT rises to come under the Tories was very much on the money.But George Osborne's allies are suggesting privately that he had, in fact, been walking Ed Miliband to the edge of an elephant trap, then beckoning the prime minister to push the opposition leader in.Ed Miliband's strategists fully expected Mr Cameron to repeat the chancellor's obfuscation on tax at the final Prime Minister's Questions of this Parliament. They would then have expanded on the theme, inviting the prime minister to answer other difficult questions - then say he wasn't being straight with the British people for avoiding them.But the Labour leader was completely wrong-footed when first the prime minister said he would rule out a VAT rise and then counter-punched, inquiring if Labour would now rule out an increase in National Insurance contributions.Ed Miliband dodged the question and what could have been downbeat Conservative benches, uneasy over the prime minister's announcement this week of his retirement plans, were given something to cheer.The reason Ed Miliband didn't respond is because he was holding the National Insurance pledge back for Labour's manifesto.But that soon became unsustainable - so the other Ed, the shadow chancellor Ed Balls, had to undertake a hasty round of the TV studios to do just that.When I spoke to him mid-tour, he put on a brave face. His view was that George Osborne, having raised VAT from 17.5% to 20%, wanted to give the issue a low profile - whereas the prime minister had now made the mistake of putting it centre stage. And he believed David Cameron's promise would be judged against his past VAT-raising performance.He defended Ed Miliband's reluctance to talk about National Insurance as he felt it would have been ""inappropriate"" to announce Labour tax policy at PMQs.So the prime minister - always a better tactician than strategist - can at least satisfy himself that he smoked Labour out on NI and disrupted at least one entry in their election campaign grid.But the exchange actually raised more questions than it answered.If the main parties are ruling out further potential sources of revenue, but still committing themselves to eradicating a £90bn black hole in the public finances, will they now be under more pressure during the election campaign to spell out in much greater detail exactly what they intend to cut?"
2015-04-06,Who's next?,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32031343,"David Cameron's declaration that he will not seek a third term in office if he retains power in May has immediately stoked interest in who might fill his shoes when he's gone. Here are the likely - and perhaps less obvious - possibilities.Claim? As chancellor of the exchequer he's the man in charge of the purse strings and master strategist - and reportedly the PM's favourite to succeed him, although he hasn't said as much. Mr Cameron's right-hand man has had an image makeover of late, with a new haircut and a diet to shed some pounds. And he has seemingly recovered from his ""omnishambles"" Budget in 2012, with his latest - and last Budget - of the parliament giving the Tories a lead in some polls. He's said to be well liked among Conservative cabinet ministers and backbench MPs, whose support is vital for any candidate wanting to take on the party leadership. He shas some work to do among grassroots Tory members, however, coming fifth in ConservativeHome's latest online poll of party members on future leaders.Latest odds: 10/1 (according to William Hill)What's he said? ""The prime minister leads a strong team but what you see from him is answering a direct question with a direct answer. I think that's really refreshing. He says he's going to serve that full five years so the real question facing the country now is do you want the strong leadership of David Cameron that's delivering zero inflation and record jobs or do you want the chaos and incompetence of Ed Miliband.""Claim? The longest-serving home secretary in 50 years, she is only the second Conservative woman to secure one of the top four jobs in government. In her role, she has talked tough on immigration and crime and taken on the Police Federation. And she is popular with Tory activists, consistently occupying either first or second place in ConservativeHome's online polls on future party leaders. There have long been claims of Mrs May positioning herself for the top job, with reported tensions between her and the prime minister. Critics say she lacks charisma and micro-manages - while some cannot forget her coining the now infamous ""nasty party"" phrase at a Tory conference in 2002, but supporters say she is a formidable operator, and have dubbed her Britain's Angela Merkel. Latest odds: 9/2What's she said? ""My view is very simple, David Cameron is a first class leader of the party and a first class prime minister and I hope he is going to be doing that for a very long time."" (Desert Island discs, 23 November 2014)Claim? The blonde bombshell and mayor of London who can seemingly reach voters that others in the party cannot. Casting aside a rather chequered past he steered the capital through the 2012 Olympics, launched the successful and popular ""Boris bikes"" and got rid of London's ""bendy buses"" in favour of the new Routemaster double deckers. Mr Johnson hopes to revive his Westminster parliamentary career at the general election. He has been tipped by many to take the helm of the Conservative Party, and has not discouraged the idea. Like Theresa May, he is also a favourite among the grassroots of the party, pipping her to the top spot in ConservativeHome's latest poll of party members on future leaders. (he's ahead by 2 points). Critics say the gaffe-prone politician is not the right man for the job, but his supporters point to his wide-spread appeal.Latest odds: 9/4What's he said? ""I think what David Cameron is saying is banal and obvious. There has already been a leader of the Conservative Party for ten years and he's done an outstanding job. What he's saying now is that he wants to serve through to 2020 and that is frankly what we need him to do... five more years is what this country needs. I'm not entirely certain I see what the story is. He was asked a straight question, are you going to serve a third term like Mrs Thatcher or Tony Blair and he said no, because he thinks that ten years on top of British politics is an incredibly long time.""Claim? A self-made millionaire and devotee of Margaret Thatcher, he is regarded as one of the Conservatives' fastest-rising stars. The Treasury minister-turned-culture secretary became the first of the 2010 intake of MPs to reach cabinet level, and the first Asian male Conservative cabinet minister. He's currently polling well among the Conservative grassroots, who voted him third most preferable leader in ConservativeHome's latest online future leader poll. David Cameron recently said he wants to see a British Asian prime minister in his lifetime.Latest odds: 12/1Claim? Currently holding one of the four great offices of state - foreign secretary - Mr Hammond's name has often cropped up whenever talk of leadership contenders has emerged. He has built up an impressive CV in government since the Conservatives came to power in 2010, being first awarded the job of transport secretary before his promotion to defence secretary where he stayed for three years. He's regarded by many commentators as being a potential candidate for the Tory right. He seems to have work to do among party activists, scoring only 4% in ConservativeHome's future leader poll.Latest odds: 12/1"
2015-04-06,Cereal number,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-magazine-monitor-31962592,"David Cameron has declared he won't seek a third term as prime minister, citing an advertising slogan for Shredded Wheat used in the UK more than 30 years ago. What's its enduring power, asks Justin Parkinson.The hotel kitchen staff are in disbelief. Someone in room 147 has ordered three Shredded Wheat. The maid transports them upstairs to find England cricketer Ian Botham waiting at a table, dressed in full whites.The maid leaves. Botham hides one of the Shredded Wheat under a napkin and winks to camera. Cue music, as the slogan ""Shredded Wheat. Bet you can't eat three"" appears.This advert and others featuring football manager Brian Clough and the actor Richard Kiel, who played Jaws in James Bond films, have not run for some time. Nestle, which owns the brand, says the last probably aired in 1984.But their message seems to have waned little. Telling the BBC he would only serve a limited time in Downing Street, David Cameron said: ""Terms are like Shredded Wheat - two are wonderful but three might just be too many.""The prime minister's reprise was unlikely to be accidental, says Thayne Forbes, joint managing director of the brand-valuation company Intangible Business. ""Everybody would empathise with the view that three Shredded Wheat would probably be too much,"" he says. ""The slogan suggests people shouldn't overdo it. It sounds modest and reasoned.""As marketing goes, it might seem counter-intuitive, as it discourages excessive consumption. But it also sounds honest and unexploitative.Other advertising slogans and themes are in wide use in public and political discourse. Examples include Marmite being a by-word for divisiveness - a ""Marmite person"" is either loved or hated. Cameron has twice referred to Ronseal - the woodcare product that does ""exactly what it says on the tin"". But Shredded Wheat, its best-known slogan having lain dormant for so long, appears to be used less often. The cereal, created in the US in the 1890s, has long been sold as good for the evolving British lifestyle. A newspaper advert in 1902 described it as ""a relief from the monotony of everlasting porridge"", while, by 1943, it was ""an ideal food for all war workers"". The 1980s saw an emphasis on ""simple, honest goodness"", while, in the 2000s, its long heritage and reliability was promoted.""It's a good association for Cameron,"" says Forbes. ""He must have been brought up on it, like lots of other people. It will be great marketing for Shredded Wheat to have the slogan used after so many years, too.""Subscribe to the BBC News Magazine's email newsletter to get articles sent to your inbox"
2015-04-06,Are you 'cosmopolitan'?,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32021853,"The rise of UKIP heralds the emergence of a new divide in British politics, with cosmopolitan voters on one side and non-cosmopolitan ones on the other, argues Jeremy Cliffe.We hear a lot about UKIP these days. The party stole the show at the local and European elections last year, then again in the autumn when it lured two Conservative MPs to defect.  In the past weeks alone there have been three much-discussed television programmes about the party: ""Meet the Ukippers"", ""Farage Fans and UKIP Lovers"" and ""100 Days of UKIP"". At the upcoming general election the party will probably increase its share of seats in Westminster - and will certainly affect the results in dozens of other constituencies by taking votes from the other parties. But ask some of those academics who have been watching UKIP's rise, and they will tell you that it is just one part of a bigger story. We are all used to the left-right divide in politics: a spectrum of different views on how much the government should tax, spend, regulate and otherwise intervene in the economy. But according to Dr Rob Ford of Manchester University, UKIP exists on a different axis, one to do with cultural rather than economic matters. This new political scale is ever more prominent in British political life.Radio 4's Analysis programmeOn the one end of it is what you might call a ""cosmopolitan"" philosophy: a relaxed, liberal attitude to issues concerning national identity (like immigration) and to questions of morality and lifestyle (like gay marriage). On the other end is a ""non-cosmopolitan"" outlook: more nationalist, socially conservative and less comfortable with social change, or in other words the ideological stance often associated with typical UKIP voters. This divide cuts across the left-right scale: there are cosmopolitan and non-cosmopolitan voters in both the Conservative and the Labour camps, which is why UKIP takes support from both.Lots of things are making this cosmopolitanism divide more important. One is that the old class-based, ideological conflict between left and right has declined. Dr James Tilley of Oxford University argues that politicians are partly to blame. The economic philosophies of the Conservative and Labour parties are so similar, he argues, that other, cultural issues are becoming more important. Another factor is the growing gap between the generations: the difference in outlook between the cosmopolitan young and less cosmopolitan, older voters is greater than it was in the past (partly due to the recent rise in levels of university education, which tend to correlate with liberal views). This trend presents the established parties with some difficult questions. As Dr Ford puts it, they ""have to try and deal with this rising value divide, particularly now that UKIP has mobilised it into the political debate."" ""They have to make a move,"" he adds, ""but any move that they make risks making their position worse with one or the other of these groups of voters."" Sound too cosmopolitan, and the parties risk losing supporters to UKIP. Try to ""out-UKIP UKIP"", and they could alienate their younger, more socially liberal supporters. So both are doing the political splits, trying to reconcile the cosmopolitans within their ranks with the non-cosmopolitans. Witness the tortuous attempts by Ed Miliband to sound tough on immigration without sounding too tough. Witness, too, the recent struggles of David Cameron to persuade social conservatives in his party that gay marriage can be an innately conservative institution. In the long-term, this divide will become less problematic. That is because over the years the country will tilt towards the cosmopolitan end of this new spectrum. So says Penny Young of NatCen, the research organisation that conducts the extensive British Social Attitudes survey. Various demographic factors explain this trend. The country as a whole is becoming more accepting of same-sex relationships. Younger voters are more relaxed about things like immigration and national identity than were previous generations when they were young, suggesting that the overall population will tilt in an internationalist direction over time. And ever more parts of the country are acquiring the ethnic and social diversity once confined to the inner cities, a trend that generally makes people more comfortable with immigration. According to Dr Ford the question is therefore: how should the main political parties navigate this period of transition? It would be wrong to simply abandon the swathes of voters at the less cosmopolitan end of the scale; voters who are usually older and more isolated than the average member of the population.Yet the politicians do need to adapt to the changing attitudes of British society and be honest with voters rather than pandering to views that, deep down, they do not share. This quandary may not decide the upcoming general election, but in the established parties savvy strategists with an eye to elections in 2020 and beyond are grappling with it nonetheless. That is a wise move."
2015-04-06,Dudley debate,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32015334,"I met Afzal Amin for the first time on Friday, but I already knew who he was. In Dudley North, the seat he was selected by the Conservatives to fight in the general election, Mr Amin had become hard to avoid. When I first looked at the local newspaper online, the pages were surrounded by ""Amin"" logos in the preferred Tory shade of blue.Not long after we met, he asked me to pose for a photo, snapped by one of his campaign team, and doubtless rapidly tweeted out to followers of the would-be MP.Perhaps no surprise that the man running such a disciplined operation has served in the army and been to Sandhurst. That was very much the message he delivered on Friday, as he addressed school and college pupils at a hustings in Dudley which I'd been invited to chair.There was combative debate, too, not least with his Labour rival, the MP Ian Austin. Both men knew the Dudley contest was critical for their respective parties; Ian Austin held the seat by just over 600 votes in 2010. Just as David Cameron was denied a majority by failing to take seats like this one, so Ed Miliband is unlikely to be in No 10 if Labour loses Dudley North.He was self-confident and fluent. The only obvious mis-step came right at the end, when he interrupted Vicky Duckworth, the Green candidate for the neighbouring seat. She expressed the opinion that politics often seemed to be about men shouting at each other; Mr Amin complained she was engaging in gender bias.A few weeks ago, one Conservative MP who knows him well and respects his talents, said Afzal Amin had warned him of the risks of over-confidence. He thought he risked running before he could walk.Well, he stumbled badly this weekend. Whatever the purpose of his contacts with the English Defence League - and he strongly disputes claims that he wanted them to hold a protest that would then be called off, for which he could then take the credit - the exposure has damaged him and, potentially, the prospects of his party re-taking the seat.In February, the EDL staged a rally against plans for a new mosque in the town. As the Mail on Sunday story makes clear, Afzal Amin pleaded with them beforehand not to hold that demonstration; but it went ahead anyway. It's what happened subsequently which will feature in Tuesday's disciplinary hearing.Over the weekend, I put his defence to a very senior Conservative source - that this was an attempt to broker a compromise in order to bring together a divided community. The arch response: Dudley isn't Kandahar.Nor do I think from my visits to the town, where I'm going to be based for the general election, will people in Dudley appreciate being painted as somewhere riven by racial discord.True, Dudley was the scene of one of England's earliest race riots. But that was in 1962. Although the controversy over replacing the mosque - currently in a converted school and inadequate for the numbers who want to worship there - has been running for a decade, community relations are generally good. Even those who don't want a new mosque didn't want the EDL protestors - nor to be fair the anti-fascist counter-demonstrators who followed them.As for the Conservative Party, the view of the national leadership is that you don't collaborate with the EDL. Not least because the Tories are still struggling to bury some historic baggage in the Black Country: Enoch Powell was an MP in Wolverhampton when he delivered his Rivers of Blood speech about immigration in 1968.Four years before that, there was the notorious election in Smethwick which the Conservatives were accused of winning by wooing white voters with an offensive rhyme suggesting who'd they'd get as a neighbour if they voted Labour. Afzal Amin grew up in Smethwick so he should be aware of that history. He was, until his suspension on Saturday, one of about 17% of Conservative parliamentary candidates who are not white. The party is proud of that, but it's still struggling to translate that into votes.Afzal Amin may believe that he can persuade the party to lift the suspension when he meets party officials on Tuesday. I have my doubts. Even if they accept his defence, will the other parties be so charitable? The allegations would follow him on the campaign trail, and make planned visits by cabinet ministers next to impossible.On Friday, just before the hustings in Dudley began, Afzal Amin gave me his business card. It introduces him as 'prospective member of Parliament Dudley North'. I think I'll keep it; it could yet become a collector's item."

2015-04-07,Bid to change Speaker election rules,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32061097,"A last-minute bid to change the way the Speaker of the House of Commons is elected is to be debated by MPs.Labour criticised the government motion, to be debated on the final day before the dissolution of Parliament, saying the Conservatives were ""trying to play politics with the speakership"".Under the proposals, a secret ballot would decide whether there should be a contested election for the post.MPs currently have to file through the division lobbies to cast their vote.This means it is clear who does or does not back the incumbent as Speaker.Labour's shadow leader of the Commons Angela Eagle raised the party's concerns in the House on Wednesday evening, questioning whether the motion was within parliamentary rules.Current Speaker John Bercow is - technically - one of them, but many Tory MPs have never liked him.They resent his personal style and some believe he is far from impartial in the way he conducts business in the Commons.Attempts by some to force a vote on his resumption as Speaker in 2010 came to nothing. There have been the occasional measured jibes at him from the prime minister. Other Tories reportedly went much further and formed a group whose members had all been reprimanded by him. But the Speaker is a reformer who believes passionately that the people who elect the members, and pay the bills, should come first.The last act of the coalition looks like being an attempt to unseat him. And they are very serious about it.One Tory MP fighting an important marginal seat had been cleared by his party to be away from Parliament but he is now staying for the vote, such is the importance of it.She told Deputy Speaker Lindsay Hoyle: ""It's just come to my attention that the government has tabled a motion for debate on the final day of this Parliament, with no notice whatsoever to myself as shadow leader of the House, proposing changes to the way in which the Speaker of this House is elected.""Procedural matters in this House, with no consultation with the opposition, no consultation with the chair of the committee itself, for debate in only one hour tomorrow.""Mr Hoyle said the motion had been ""rightly or wrongly"" agreed to on Tuesday, saying that ""business of the House is decided by the government, not by the chair.""A spokesman for Commons Leader William Hague said the motion had been tabled as a free hour had opened up in Thursday's business after the House of Lords approved the Modern Slavery Bill.The proposed change would apply when a Speaker wishes to continue in the post after a general election.Under the current rules, if the Speaker's re-appointment is objected to, a division is held, with MPs choosing to back or oppose the Speaker in the division lobbies.The replacement of this method with a secret ballot was suggested in 2010 by a committee of MPs, which said the public method ""can be seen as a deterrent to the House expressing its views honestly"".MPs will now debate whether this change should be made."

2015-04-07,MPs warn on growth of UK jihadists,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32059813,"Not enough is being done to prevent people leaving the UK to join Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, a group of MPs has warned.Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said Britain must win their ""hearts and minds"".The committee's report comes as the BBC launches a database tracking British jihadists in Syria and Iraq. It shows that many people left in clusters from certain UK areas - often due to friendships and peer groups. The MPs' report argued that preventative work with communities, families and international partners was ""vital"" and needs to be a top priority for the Home Office.  ""The number of cases being brought to public attention should ring alarm bells,"" said Labour MP Mr Vaz.  ""This must be a relentless battle for hearts and minds, and without a strong counter-narrative we are in danger of failing to prevent even more departures. We are at the edge of a cliff."" The BBC has been tracking the stories of the men, women, boys and girls who have gone to Syria and Iraq to understand why they go, where they go from and what happens to them. By analysing around 160 profiles, it reveals the way in which people have travelled in clusters - a group of three young friends from Coventry, another group from Portsmouth, drawn out by one person they knew, others in Cardiff linked to people involved in an extremist organisation. Social media might play a part but face-to-face contact appears just as, if not more, important, according to the database.It includes the stories of: The BBC research emphasises the extent to which real-world contacts, rather than just online connections, are often a key driver of radicalisation and intent to travel to Iraq and Syria. Some of the experts who appeared before the Home Affairs Committee also argued the internet was a secondary influence. They said that universities and prisons were among the two most significant places where radicalisation occurred. A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police, which was not aware of the report, said it would have ""welcomed the opportunity"" to have given evidence to the committee and that it planned to look at the report in detail.The disappearance of schoolgirls Shamima Begum, Amira Abase, both 15, and Kadiza Sultana, 16, from east London in February, raised questions as to who could have done more to prevent their departure. After taking evidence from the police and the families of the girls among others, Mr Vaz said their case suffered from a ""lack of immediate action"". He added: ""Schools and the police must inform parents immediately, and work with them even if there is the smallest hint of radicalisation, or a close association with someone who is thought to have been radicalised.""However, the Met Police spokesman defended the speed of the police response to the schoolgirls' disappearance.  He said the committee's criticism was ""misleading"", pointing to the evidence given by both UK and Turkish authorities of ""rapid exchanges"" between the two.The committee's report said there needed to be an advice service which would be a less extreme step than calling the anti-terrorist hotline.The Association of Chief Police Officer's lead officer for the government's anti-terror strategy Prevent, Chief Constable Sir Peter Fahy, agreed that more needed to be done.However, he said the police ""do not have the capacity"" to routinely work with every school in the country.He added: ""The police service will play its part but the prime responsibility for dissuading young people from getting involved in extremist activity has to lie with parents, families and carers.""The committee also pointed to weaknesses in information sharing with airlines and other countries. It said greater care needed to be taken at airport check-in desks when people were travelling to destinations of concern - namely Syria, Somalia, Iraq and Nigeria, as well as neighbouring countries, such as Turkey. The report said police also needed to work faster to alert overseas partners and airlines when there were concerns over individuals.There were signs that some of the girls had followed extremist accounts on social media, the report said.The committee said that social media companies, such as Facebook and Twitter, should be prepared to suspend accounts when there is evidence they are being used to promote violent extremism.  The report also said it was disappointed the Home Office had not implemented a programme for individuals returning to Britain where there is evidence they had fought in Syria.Security officials estimate that some 600 Britons have left the country to join IS - and while around half may have returned, many are still out there - and some have died.  The BBC project includes detailed profiles of individuals which can be searched, based on hometown, age and gender, as well as those who have been convicted in the courts or who are believed to have been killed."

If not, the prince's private letters will either remain confidential, as the sender intended, or they'll be exposed to a large and inquisitive audience.

That will be a clear pledge from us.""He accused Mr Cameron of making an ""out of the blue, panicky"" announcement on VAT that ""no one in Britain will believe"".Labour, which has already announced plans to increase the top rate of income tax and impose a new ""mansion tax"" on high value properties, insists its plans are fully costed and will not require additional tax hikes if it wins May's general election.Mr Miliband began his final head-to-head encounter with Mr Cameron before the election by joking that the PM had ""announced his retirement plans"" - a reference to a BBC interview in which the prime minister said he would not serve a third term if the Tories remained in power.Challenging Mr Cameron to give a ""straight answer to a straight question"", Mr Miliband pressed him on whether he would rule out a rise in VAT after the election, as Labour had done.In response, the prime minister immediately said ""yes"", prompting loud cheers in turn from the Conservative benches. He contrasted what he said was a ""clear promise"" with Labour's unwillingness to rule out a rise in National Insurance.""I answered a very simple question about VAT. I ruled out an increase... straight answer to him, straight question from me. I have ruled out VAT. Will he rule out national insurance contributions. Yes or no?"" Mr Cameron added: ""We all know this is Labour's job tax. This is their tax of choice. This is what they clobber working people, families and enterprises with.""But Mr Miliband responded by saying there was ""only one person who is going to raise taxes on working families and that is him"".He said nobody would believe Mr Cameron on VAT ""because of his extreme spending plans, because his numbers do not add up and because he promised it last time and broke his promise"".Mr Cameron, he added, had broken other promises made before the last election to reduce annual net migration below 100,000 and not to pursue a major structural re-organisation of the NHS, adding that it was ""time for a better plan and time for a Labour government"".But Mr Cameron suggested a future Labour government would result in the ""chaos of economic crisis"", with Ed Miliband being ""held hostage"" by the SNP.The packed session provided a last opportunity for the two men to rally their MPs and set out their arguments before the start of the election campaign next week.Speaking after the exchanges and the other parties' tax pledges, deputy prime minister Nick Clegg said the Lib Dems ""don't need to raise VAT, national insurance or headline rates of income tax or corporation tax either"".""There are other taxes and other tax loopholes that we can increase or close in order to balance the books,"" he said.

2015-04-07,Met police 'had files on MPs in 90s',https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32044580,"A former undercover police officer has told BBC News that Scotland Yard kept intelligence files on MPs during the 1990s. Ex-Special Branch officer Peter Francis says he saw files on 10 Labour MPs which he and others regularly updated. He says he personally gathered information on three MPs as part of his work infiltrating left-wing groups. The MPs named, and Labour, have called for a forthcoming public inquiry into undercover policing to be widened. Mr Francis operated undercover between 1993 and 1997 in the Met's now disbanded Special Demonstration Squad. He was told to embed himself in left-wing groups or causes that were deemed to pose a potential threat to security. He says that during this period he was told to gather intelligence on MPs and their activities if and when they featured in any of his operations. That information, he says, was added to a special pink file that was available for Special Branch officers to read. Between 1990 and 2001, he claims to have personally seen records relating to Diane Abbott, the late Tony Benn, Jeremy Corbyn, the late Bernie Grant, Peter Hain, Harriet Harman, Ken Livingstone, Joan Ruddock, Dennis Skinner and Jack Straw.Four of the group became ministers during Mr Francis's time in Special Branch - including Jack Straw who was home secretary after 1997. ""When I was deployed undercover in the Special Demonstration Squad, any MP that I came across, such as on demonstrations, I would report back on them,"" he said. Mr Francis says that the files not only contained the MPs' publicly-stated political views - but also intelligence on what was going on behind the scenes in the party or their group. He says some of the information would have been things said in private by the MP, depending on how close each undercover officer had been able to get. Mr Francis said that when he first saw the files he understood that each had probably been created before the individual was an MP because of their personal involvement in radical causes or protests.But he added: ""When they became MPs these files carried on. It [was] your duty as an SDS officer to report back any intelligence that you come across. ""I felt that it was OK to report back on MPs,"" he said. ""I used to give myself a pat on the back, thinking 'I have done a good job'. These MPs were spied on and they should know.""""I don't think the police force should be monitoring MPs, full stop. I don't think we have any right to do that at all. It may be justifiable to say that the Security Service should be doing it - but I certainly don't think the police should be doing it.""Scotland Yard has refused to comment on the substance of the claims, but a spokesman said it had not shied away from serious allegations about the SDS. It said that Operation Herne, the internal police investigation into what happened in the unit, remained an ongoing investigation.""Operation Herne maintains that without speaking to Peter Francis it is simply not possible to fully investigate allegations he makes,"" said a spokesman. ""Operation Herne remains very willing to engage with him.""Mr Francis said that he has refused to speak to Operation Herne because he fears being interviewed under caution as a suspect, rather than a whistleblower. Scotland Yard told the BBC that Operation Herne detectives would be prepared to speak to him as a witness. He has, however, spoken to Mark Ellison QC who reviewed allegations about the SDS for the Home Secretary Theresa May - prompting her to launch a statutory inquiry. He says he will appear before those hearings. Peter Hain, who was a leader of the anti-apartheid movement in the late 1960s and 70s and became an MP in 1991, said he now wants full answers from Scotland Yard. ""I was deeply disturbed to find that files were still being kept by the Special Branch while I and others were serving Members of Parliament,"" he said. ""That is constitutionally an outrage. It infringes the sovereignty of Parliament. ""I want to see the home secretary widen the scope of the inquiry into the SDS to look specifically at the surveillance of MPs and the fact that there were active files on us while we were serving Members of Parliament. ""This should never have happened and it should have been reported and properly authorised - and we don't know whether it was.""Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper echoed the call for the inquiry to be widened in light of what she described as ""extremely serious and disturbing allegations"".""While undercover policing remains a crucial tool in combating serious and organised crime it must not be abused,"" she said.""There have now been a series of serious allegations about undercover policing - ranging from the treatment of Stephen Lawrence's family to police having long-term inappropriate relationships. ""We called some time ago for much stronger oversight of undercover policing and it is also vital to get to the truth about what has happened."" Mrs May announced earlier this month that Lord Justice Pitchford would lead the inquiry into the SDS allegations - but the precise shape of that inquiry is not yet clear.A Home Office spokesman said the review by Mark Ellison QC had unearthed ""serious historical failings"". ""That is why the Home Secretary established a public inquiry to thoroughly investigate undercover policing and the operation of the Special Demonstration Squad. ""Lord Justice Pitchford will consult interested parties to the inquiry over the coming months on setting the terms of reference, with a view to publishing these at the end of July.""Undercover policing is an essential tactic in the fight against crime but to improve the public's confidence in undercover work we must ensure there is no repeat of these failings in the future."""
2015-04-07,NHS problems worst 'since 1990s',https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/health-32057948,"Services in the NHS in England are deteriorating in a way not seen since the early 1990s, according to a leading health think tank. The King's Fund review said waiting times for A&E, cancer care and routine operations had all started getting worse, while deficits were growing.It said such drops in performance had not been seen for 20 years.But the think tank acknowledged the NHS had done as well as could be expected, given the financial climate.Professor John Appleby, chief economist at the King's Fund, which specialises in health care policy, said: ""The next government will inherit a health service that has run out of money and is operating at the very edge of its limits. ""There is now a real risk that patient care will deteriorate as service and financial pressures become overwhelming.""He said in terms of how standards were slipping - not how low they had reached - the situation was the worst it had been since the ""early 1990s"".The report noted much of the deterioration has happened in the second-half of the Parliament with many measures of performance being maintained in the first few years.It said the next government had to address the funding situation, adding the extra £8bn a year NHS England says is needed by 2020, was the ""minimum"" that would be required.The report - a review of performance this Parliament - highlights a range of problems as well as achievements. These include:The report is the second part of the King's Fund pre-election review of the NHS this Parliament.Last month it warned the coalition government's reforms of the health service had been ""damaging and distracting"".The King's Fund report should make worrying reading. The reference to the 1990s conjures up images of - for the NHS at least - a bygone era. The think tank's point was not that waiting times had reached the level they were at then, rather that this is the first time in two decades of almost continuous improvement that there has been a sustained drop in performance.In many ways, that had to happen. Services cannot keep getting better for ever. Nonetheless, the findings are crystal clear: the NHS is at a critical juncture. But what is less easy to determine is to what extent the coalition's policies have contributed to the difficulties.The think tank has already provided a critical analysis of the government's reforms - and when pushed, acknowledged the health service may have been ""in better shape"" if they had not happened.But the more significant issue for the health of the health service this Parliament has been the squeeze on finances. Even though the budget has been increased, it has felt more like a cut to many because demands have risen so quickly.On this though, the King's Fund accepted that the government's hands were tied. Given the state of the economy, ministers did as much as they could have.Read more from NickRoyal College of Nursing general secretary Peter Carter said politicians needed to take note of the warnings made by the King's Fund.""Morale is low, and more and more staff are being made sick with stress because of the intolerable pressure they are under,"" he added. Katherine Murphy, of the Patients Association, said: ""The findings echo what we are hearing on a daily basis on our helpline. It is clear to the public that the future of the NHS is one of the most important issues facing the nation and it should be a central issue in the election campaign.""Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham said: ""Five years ago David Cameron stood on a promise to protect the NHS. This report provides authoritative proof that he has broken that promise.""But a Department of Health spokesman said: ""As the King's Fund says, the NHS has 'performed well in the face of huge challenges', but if we are to continue to invest in the NHS going forward it needs to be backed by a strong economy.""

2015-04-07,SNP 'could block Tory government',https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32045419,"The SNP would block a minority Conservative government by voting down its Queen's Speech if it holds the post-election balance of power, its former leader Alex Salmond has said.Mr Salmond said the move could bring down the government if Labour joined in, with David Cameron ""locked out"".The Conservatives accused him of ""trying to sabotage the democratic will of the British people"".Labour has called his balance of power prediction ""bluster and bluff"".In recent days Mr Salmond, who is bidding to become a Westminster MP at the 7 May general election, has claimed his party could ""hold the power"" in a hung Parliament and would be able to influence the Budget of a minority Labour government.This was dismissed by Labour leader Ed Miliband, who has ruled out a formal coalition with the Scottish nationalists.The SNP currently has six MPs at Westminster, but recent opinion polls suggest its share could increase dramatically at the general election.James Cook, BBC News Scotland correspondentIf the Conservatives attempt to form a minority government and enough MPs vote against their Queen's Speech the administration would fall at the first hurdle and the leader of the opposition would have a shot at forming a government.That's how parliamentary democracy works in the event of a hung Parliament.And yet the Conservatives are saying that by planning to vote against a government he opposes Alex Salmond has ""confirmed he would sabotage the democratic will of the British people in order to make Ed Miliband prime minister"".It is part of their continuing attempt to portray Mr Miliband as a weak leader whose strings are being pulled by Mr Salmond.This kind of language causes despair among Tories north of the border who fear that the party in London is waltzing into an SNP trap.They know that many voters in Scotland will read the phrase ""democratic will of the British people"" and hear ""democratic will of the English people"".Because, if it is illegitimate for Scottish MPs, from whatever party, to vote against one government and support another in the British parliament, then what, voters may ask, is the point of the union?Who is dancing to Mr Salmond's tune now?Mr Salmond, the former Scottish first minister, told the New Statesman that in the event of a hung Parliament, a minority Conservative government would have to ""go straight effectively for a vote of confidence - usually the Queen's Speech, although it could be otherwise, of course - and we'd be voting against.""If David Cameron lost this vote, he said, there would be a two-week period for another government to be formed.BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said Mr Salmond had ""hardened his anti-Conservative rhetoric"" in the interview.A Conservative spokesman said:  ""Alex Salmond has confirmed he would sabotage the democratic will of the British people in order to make Ed Miliband prime minister. ""That would mean chaos for Britain, with weak Ed Miliband dancing to Alex Salmond's tune.""He said the ""only way to keep Britain together"" was to vote Conservative.Mr Salmond's latest comments come after Mr Miliband said the only people writing a future Labour Budget would be himself and shadow chancellor Ed Balls.Speaking in Clydebank on Monday, he added: ""It's not going to be Alex Salmond - not in a million years."""
2015-04-07,MPs criticise 'lack of EU debate',https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32045290,"The government's ""failure"" to let MPs debate EU legislation is ""deplorable"", a Parliamentary committee says.The European Scrutiny Committee said ministers had refused to schedule debates on issues such as free movement and the EU's Budget.It also said BBC coverage of EU matters should be ""improved substantially"".The government said the number of EU debates had doubled since 2009-10, while the BBC said its coverage was ""extensive and impartial"".The cross-party committee's role includes scrutinising EU documents and recommending the most important for debate in the House of Commons.Its report said in the period covering most of the 2014-15 financial year there were three debates on the floor of the House, compared with 12 in 2013-14.It also pointed out that not a single debate had taken place during a nine-month period, between 9 June 2014 and 9 March 2015.""The government's collective failure to schedule so many debates on EU documents over the past year is deplorable, and is a discourtesy to this committee and to all members of the House,"" the MPs said.Prime Minister David Cameron has sought to rally support from other EU leaders for his plans to curb welfare payments to European migrants ahead of a referendum on the UK's membership if he wins the general election.The committee said the government's ""cavalier"" approach was ""at odds with UK ministers' claims in their speeches across the EU about the role of national parliaments"".The Foreign Office said the government was committed to a ""strong EU scrutiny system that enables Parliament to hold it to account for the decisions taken in Brussels"".It added: ""We have made good on our commitment to raise standards by doubling the number of Europe debates on the floor of the House since 2009-10.""This government has also increased by around a fifth since 2010 the number of EU proposals that have been scrutinised and cleared by Parliament before being agreed in Brussels.""The committee has also been examining the BBC's coverage of European issues, taking evidence from director general Lord Hall and head of news James Harding earlier this month.During that appearance, Lord Hall said the desire for balanced output ""ran deep"" within the BBC and he believed that this was being achieved.Mr Harding said if the public was going to trust the BBC to report on politicians impartially it had to be clear that BBC journalists weren't ""asked by politicians to come and account for what they do and in effect do the bidding of those politicians"".But the committee said it was ""concerned about the manner in which the BBC treats EU issues"", calling for coverage to be ""improved substantially"".It suggested coverage did not reflect all sides of the debate on the European Union, and more analysis was needed. Its chairman, Conservative MP Sir William Cash, said the BBC had ""very particular obligations"" to be impartial and to ""educate and inform"".He added:  ""We do not believe this is currently being achieved in the context of the BBC's EU coverage.""A BBC spokesman said the corporation provided extensive and impartial coverage of European and Parliamentary issues, and it would be a breach of the corporation's independence if a committee of MPs instructed the BBC on its coverage."
2015-04-07,Lobbyists must 'conform' with rules,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32047992,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe woman in charge of the government's new register of lobbyists has said she expects the industry to ""conform"" with the statutory system. Speaking ahead of the register's launch, Alison White conceded a lot of lobbyists would not be listed on it.But she said her job was to make sure the rules were implemented and she would do so with ""extreme verve and vigour.""But one critic of the register said it was ""fake"" and full of ""loopholes"".Lobbyists are companies or individuals paid to influence government decisions.The coalition promised to introduce a statutory register of lobbyists when it came to power in 2010, and legislation was passed last year, with ministers saying the move would help clean up politics.However, the new register will only cover consultant lobbyists and will not apply to lobbyists working ""in-house"" for companies or organisations.A person or company will only need to be registered if they are contacting a government minister or permanent secretary in a government department - leading to criticism it will not come close to reflecting the scale or nature of lobbying that goes on across Whitehall.But Ms White, who is independent of the government, said her task was to implement the law as it stood not to question the powers she had been given. ""We are having something that has never been in place before,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""This is a statutory register. The industry tells me it is a professional industry. I expect them to conform with the legislation. It is my job to make sure they do so.""Ms White, who was appointed as the registrar of consultant lobbyists in September, acknowledged the register would not indicate different ""levels of lobbying"".""The legislation was quite narrowly drafted to address a particular issue, which was that it was not always particularly clear, when ministers were being lobbied, who the client of the lobbyist was. That is what the register was set up to do,"" she said.She added: ""This will give anyone who wishes to access the register the opportunity to be able to see who is lobbying and being paid for it and who their clients are. That is the main information the register will contain.""If a lobbyist sets out to influence government policy in some way, they would have to be registered. If they are not registered, then they would not be conforming. They have to go on the register before they lobby.""Ms White said last month that the register would not have any entries on its launch day but she had received more than ""20 expressions of interest"" about joining and companies and individuals might be required to sign up retrospectively.Potential registrants will be able to log on and create an account to file an ""information return"".But Tamasin Cave, from the Alliance for Lobbying Transparency coalition, said ""hardly anyone"" in the industry would be covered by the provisions of the new law. ""You have a huge commercial lobbying industry, and very few of them will have to sign up,"" she told Today.""The second flaw is that it won't show the interaction between lobbyists and government, and that is what a register is for.""It is to show the activity - who is discussing what with whom, but this shows nothing of this interaction. It is a fake register."""
2015-04-07,Car smoking ban MSP welcomes backing,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-south-scotland-32055226,"The Liberal Democrat MSP behind a bill to ban smoking in cars when children are present has welcomed the support of the Scottish government.South of Scotland MSP Jim Hume launched the members' bill in December.The government said it was ""very supportive"" of the principles of the bill, but changes could be needed to make it ""workable"".Motorists could potentially be fined £100 for breaching the rule if it becomes law.Mr Hume lodged draft proposals for a bill last May calling for a ban in Scotland on smoking in private vehicles when children under 18 were present.He said he was ""over the moon"" at the news the Scottish government would endorse the Smoking Prohibition (Children in Motor Vehicles) (Scotland) Bill.He said: ""With cross-party support and the support of many third sector organisations, there is every chance that this could be in place in the next year.""Eighty-four per cent of the 160 responses to my consultation were positive and people from across Scotland have expressed their support for the move.""The bill is about guaranteeing that children in Scotland can have the freedom to go on and lead healthy lives if they choose to.""I look forward to working with MSPs from all parties as the bill progresses.""Public Health Minister Maureen Watt said the Scottish government had considered including the measure in its Public Health Bill, but instead decided to support Mr Hume's proposals.She said: ""As with any bill, as it goes through the scrutiny process, there may be amendments and improvements to strengthen the legislation and ensure it is fit for purpose. ""But we believe that the underpinning principles are strong, and that is why I am pleased to support it.""Scottish Labour and a wide range of health organisations have backed his proposals.But the Scottish Conservatives have reservations about how the bill would work in practice.The party's health spokesman Jackson Carlaw said: ""While Scottish Conservatives support any moves which would protect young people from hazardous second hand smoke we have concerns as to how this would be enforced.""It would be a better use of resources to conduct a public awareness campaign similar to that which is being proposed by the government in Wales.""We will be watching this campaign in order to ascertain what lessons may be learned and what approaches may be adopted in Scotland.""Anti-smoking campaigners welcomed the Scottish government's backing for Mr Hume's bill.ASH Scotland's chief executive Sheila Duffy said: ""It is another public health initiative that can help Scotland move forward with its ambition to achieve a tobacco-free generation in 20 years' time.""It is popular with the public and will bring Scotland into line with upcoming legislation in England and Wales.""We believe it can be effectively enforced and that having the legislation focus on cars with children bypasses concerns over interference in people's private lives.""Jim Hume must be congratulated for taking the initiative on this proposal and for all the hard work he and his team have done to bring this important measure forward.""But Simon Clark, director of the smokers' group Forest, said the bill was ""legislation for legislation's sake"".He said: ""Smoking in cars carrying children is inconsiderate. The overwhelming majority of smokers know that and don't do it.""The very small number that do will carry on regardless because the law will be difficult, if not impossible, to enforce.""Education has to be better than legislation but the government prefers gesture politics and the big stick."""
2015-04-07,Candidate quits over UKIP MEP remark,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32038485,"A UKIP election candidate has quit the party over comments made by the party's only Scottish MEP about a Scottish government minister.Tim Wilson has decided not to stand in South Northamptonshire after David Coburn MEP compared Humza Yousaf to convicted terrorist Abu Hamza.Mr Coburn has apologised for the remarks, saying it was a ""joke"".A spokesman for UKIP said Mr Wilson had failed to emphasise local issues in his general election campaign.UKIP leader Nigel Farage said Mr Coburn's remarks were a ""joke in poor taste"" but he would not be taking any action against him.But Mr Wilson said he was disillusioned with the party over the ""racist jibes"" and has decided to stand down.He told BBC Scotland he was appalled by Mr Coburn's comments about Mr Yousaf and frustrated by the inaction of the party's leadership on the issue.  He said David Coburn had produced ""what I can only describe as an Islamaphobic insult, and that's simply not acceptable"".  Mr Wilson added: ""Of course he went on and apologised.  I think, frankly, that if you are in a position of power you have to be able to control what ideas emerge from your head and how they get to your mouth and, in fact, you shouldn't have those ideas in the first place.  ""But the real issue is that when Mr Farage was asked what he thought about this he dismissed this as a joke.  ""I don't think this is a joke. I think this is something very serious.  It may not be that this man intended to cause offence but we aren't interested in what his intentions are.  We are interested in the effect what he says has on other people and the effect is catastrophic, it's appalling and I've resigned.""In his resignation letter, Mr Wilson said he had been ""systematically gagged by the party whip"" and forbidden to speak about Islam favourably. A spokesman for UKIP said Mr Wilson had failed to put more emphasis on local issues in his campaign.He said: ""Whilst we had initially been optimistic about Tim Wilson's abilities as a candidate, it became obvious in recent weeks that he was out of his depth in representing our party in the way we would expect. ""Mr Wilson had clearly misunderstood the expectations that UKIP place on all of its candidates. Principal amongst those is focusing on issues that are relevant to local voters. UKIP put huge emphasis on local issues and Mr Wilson was unwilling to follow UKIP guidelines in this respect.""Last week MSPs at the Scottish Parliament unanimously condemned the remarks made by Mr Coburn during a newspaper interview.MSPs were debating a motion celebrating Scotland's diverse communities.The president of the European Parliament, Martin Schulz, condemned the remarks, saying they were ""not worthy of any elected member"". But a spokesman for the president said he could not act on remarks made outside parliament.The move comes just days after another candidate, Jonathan Stanley, quit in protest at the ""racist filth"" in UKIP. Mr Stanley, who was due to stand in the Cumbrian seat of Westmorland and Lonsdale, was the party's former head of policy in Scotland."

2015-04-07,Manifesto watch,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-29642613,"Political parties are putting together their manifestos for May's general election. Here's a guide to where they currently stand on the issues voters say they care about most (according to pollsters IPSOS Mori).ImmigrationConservatives:  David Cameron wants to make migrants wait four years before they can claim certain benefits, such as tax credits, Universal Credit, or get access to social housing. He wants to stop migrants from claiming child benefit for dependents living outside the UK, and remove those that have failed to find work after six months. Mr Cameron has promised to put reform of EU free movement rules at the heart of his renegotiation of Britain's relationship with the EU. He has ruled out a temporary cap on migrant numbers or an ""emergency brake"" on EU freedom of movement rules - ideas both mooted in recent months, saying this would be less ""effective"" than reducing the incentives for people to come to the UK. The party has a continuing goal to bring net immigration down to below 100,000 people a year (it currently stands at 243,000).Labour: ""Stronger"" border controls to tackle illegal immigration with ""proper"" entry and exit checks. ""Smarter"" targets to reduce low-skilled migration but ensure university students and high-skilled workers are not deterred. Employment agencies who only recruit abroad will be outlawed while the fines for employing illegal immigrants will be increased.Lib Dems: Reintroduce exit checks at borders, so the government can identify people who are overstaying their visa. Will require all new claimants for Jobseekers Allowance to have their English language skills assessed, with JSA then being conditional on attending language courses for those whose English is poor. Ensure that EU migrants have to ""earn"" their entitlement to benefits.SNP: Allow the devolved government to have control over immigration to Scotland, and introduce a Canadian-style earned citizenship system to attract highly-skilled immigrants.Plaid Cymru: Oppose a points-based system. Support the right of asylum seekers to work in Wales while they wait for status decisions to be made. Lobby the Westminster government to ensure that they shut ""detention"" centres.UKIP: Introduce an Australian-style points policy, used to select migrants with the skills and attributes needed to work in the country - covering people from inside and outside the EU. Bring net immigration down to 50,000 people a year. Priority lanes for UK passport holders. Increase UK border staff by 2,500. Tougher English language tests for migrants seeking permanent residence. Opt out of the Dublin treaty to allow the UK to return asylum seekers to other EU countries without considering their claim. Anyone who currently has the legal right to live, work, or study in the UK would not face deportation in the event of the country's withdrawal from the EU.Greens:  Progressively reduce UK immigration controls. Migrants illegally in the UK for over five years will be allowed to remain unless they pose a serious danger to public safety. More legal rights for asylum seekers.Taxes and the economyConservatives: Eradicate the deficit by 2018 and secure an overall budget surplus by 2019-20. Achieve this by spending cuts, not tax rises, while raising NHS spending. An income tax cut for 30 million people by 2020. Tax would start to kick in at £12,500 a year, instead of £10,500. This will cost £5.6bn. The higher tax rate, 40%, would start at £50,000 instead of £41,900, again by 2020, at a cost of £1.6bn. This will be paid for through £25bn in additional spending cuts and economic growth. No increases in VAT.Labour: Get the current budget into surplus and the national debt falling ""as soon as possible in the next parliament"". No additional borrowing for new spending. Reintroduce the 50p top rate of income tax for earnings over £150,000.  Cut income tax for 24 million people by bringing back the 10p rate, paid for by scrapping the Married Couples' Tax Allowance. Bring in a ""mansion tax"" on properties worth over £2m, to raise £1.2bn. A tax on bankers' bonuses. A 5% pay cut for every government minister. Push for UK overseas territories to be put on an international blacklist if they refuse to co-operate with a drive against tax avoidance. No increases in VAT or National Insurance contributions.Lib Dems: Raise the personal allowance - the point at which you start paying income tax - to £11,000 in April 2016 and then to £12,500 by 2020. ""Strict new fiscal rules"" to ensure the deficit has gone by April 2018, with the wealthy contributing the most. The Lib Dems invented the ""mansion tax"" but in contrast to Labour have set out how it would operate - along similar lines to council tax bands. There are also Lib Dem plans to increase capital gains tax - paid on profits from second homes or shares - from 28% to 35%. Impose an additional 8% rate of corporation tax on UK banks to raise an extra £1bn a year to help pay off the deficit.SNP: Oppose UK plans in the Infrastructure Bill which will allow oil and gas drilling and hydraulic fracturing beneath people's homes without consent. Invest in offshore wind farming. Support an international bank tax and limits to industry bonuses.Plaid Cymru: Build a Green Skills Construction College, specialising in green energy. Establish a publicly-owned energy company. Establish a publicly-owned Bank of Wales business investment bank. Enforce a living wage. Give devolved nations an equal say in institutions that affect everyone's lives, such as the Bank of England.UKIP: Increase the personal allowance to the level of full-time minimum wage earnings, about £13,500, by 2020. Abolish inheritance tax. Introduce a 35% income tax rate between £42,285 and £55,000, at which point the 40% rate becomes payable. Set up a Treasury Commission to design a turnover tax on large businesses. Cut foreign aid budget by £9bn a year. Scrap HS2. Save £8bn a year in membership fees by leaving the EU.  Lower the VAT rate charged on restorations to listed buildings.Greens: People earning more than £100,000 a year would pay 50% income tax. Wealth tax of 1% to 2% on people worth £3m or more. Renationalise the railways and energy companies. Scrap HS2. Allow councils to impose extra business rates on out-of-town supermarkets to fund small local businesses. Crackdown on tax avoidance by multinationals. Allow ""the current dependence on economic growth to cease, and allow zero or negative growth to be feasible without individual hardship"". Commit Britain to a ""zero carbon"" future. Cut rail and bus fares by an average of 10%. Enforce a cap on bankers' bonuses.The NHSConservatives:  Chancellor George Osborne says he will put an extra £2bn into frontline health services across the UK, which he described as a ""down payment"" on a plan drawn up by NHS bosses calling for an extra £8bn a year above inflation by 2020. In England, everyone would be able to see a GP seven days a week by 2020. Recruit 5,000 more doctors.Labour:  Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said Labour would commit an extra £2.5bn a year above Mr Osborne's plan. The money will come from three sources - a new ""mansion"" tax, clamping down on tax avoidance by big corporations and a new tax on tobacco companies. Patients in England would get a GP appointment within 48 hours and would not have to wait longer than a week for cancer tests and results. Scrap the Health and Social Care Act and end ""creeping privatisation"" of the NHS.  Integrate health and social care services into a system of ""whole-person care"". Give greater priority to mental health services. Replace the Cancer Drugs Fund in England when it runs out in 2016 with a £330m fund to improve access to innovative cancer drugs, surgery and radiotherapy. Recruit 5,000 more healthcare workers to help patients stay in their homes and introduce new safety checks to identify people at risk of hospitalisation. Prioritise child mental health by increasing the proportion of the mental health budget spent on children.Lib Dems: An extra £1bn for the NHS every year, to be funded by - amongst other things - making higher earners pay more tax on their shares. Half of this will go towards mental health. Ensure that spending on the NHS rises in line with growth in the economy. People who need therapy for conditions such as depression will be guaranteed treatment within 18 weeks. For young patients experiencing psychosis for the first time treatment will be provided within two weeks of being referred by a GP. This is all going to happen from April, with more mental health targets to follow if the Lib Dems return to government. Wants a cross-party review of the future of NHS funding.SNP: Reduce the number of senior managers in the NHS by 25% over the next parliament. Streamline the work of health boards. Real terms increases in year-on-year NHS spending.Plaid Cymru: Recruit 1,000 extra doctors to the Welsh NHS over two terms of a Plaid government. Offer financial incentives for recruiting doctors to areas and specialisms where there are, or are predicted to be, shortages. Encourage innovation and attract more research funding, in part by increasing research and development funding as government finance allows. Improve training for postgraduate doctors and stop them being used to ""plug gaps"" in staff rotas. More recruitment from within the EU to fill vacancies and using international doctors to staff the NHS while a new generation of Welsh doctors are trained.UKIP: An extra £3bn per year in NHS funding paid for by quitting the EU and through ""middle management"" cuts. Keep NHS free at the point of delivery. Stop any further use of PFI, and encourage local authorities to buy out their PFI contracts early where it is affordable to do so. Ensure all visitors and migrants who have been here for fewer than five years have NHS-approved medical insurance as a condition of entry to UK, with £200m of the £2bn saved to be spent on ending hospital parking charges in England. Bring back state-enrolled nurses and return powers to matrons. Monitor and Care Quality Commission to be replaced with elected county health boards. Stop spending £90m a year on gastric band and breast enhancement operations.Greens: Funding to be diverted away from centralised facilities towards community healthcare, illness prevention and health promotion.  Stop privatisation. Abolish prescription charges. Dedicated NHS Tax to go direct to the health service. Ban proactive recruitment of non-British NHS staff from overseas. A complete ban on the promotion of tobacco and alcohol products, including sponsorship.Security, defence and foreign affairsConservatives: Hold a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU by 2017, after negotiating the return of some powers from Brussels. Protect foreign aid budget. Replace Trident.Labour:  Push for reform of European Union and prevent Britain from ""sleepwalking"" towards exit. Commit in law to holding a Strategic Defence and Security Review every 5 years. Outlaw discrimination and abuse of Armed Forces personnel.Lib Dems: Campaign to reduce the number of Trident nuclear submarines. Push for greater European Union efficiency. SNP: Oppose nuclear weapons and push for removal of Trident submarines from Scotland. In 2010, proposed a Scottish Centre for Reconciliation and Conflict Resolution, to promote peaceful alternatives to armed conflict. Maintain 0.7% commitment to foreign aid. Enhanced role for Scotland within the UK in Europe, particularly in fisheries policy.Plaid Cymru: Honour commitment of 0.7% of budget used for foreign aid. Campaign for cancellation of developing countries' debts. Support the Fair Trade movement. Support the 'Tobin' or 'Robin hood' tax as a means of encouraging more responsibility and stability in the global markets. Reform the IMF and World Bank in order to improve regulation and accountability. Continue membership of the EU, but campaign for democratic reform. Support minority nations and minority language speakers around the world. Pass a Military Wellbeing Act to promote and safeguard the physical and mental health and wellbeing of military personnel.UKIP:  Leave the European Union. Remove the passports of any person who has gone to fight for a terrorist organisation and deport anyone who has committed a terrorist act. Cut foreign aid budget by £9bn. Create a Veterans Department to look after the interests of ex-service men and women.Greens: Referendum on Britain's EU membership. Want reform of EU to hand powers back to local communities. Boost overseas aid to 1% of GDP within 10 years. Scrap Britain's nuclear weapons. Take the UK out of NATO unilaterally. End the so-called ""special relationship"" between the UK and the US.  Stop EU-US free trade deal TTIP. JobsConservatives: Create three million apprenticeships to be paid for by benefit cuts.Labour: Guarantee a job for under 25s unemployed for over a year and adults unemployed for more than two years. As many young people to go on an apprenticeship as currently go to university by 2025. Create a million new high technology, green jobs by 2025. Ban ""exploitative"" zero hour contracts.Lib Dems: An extra £1 an hour for the lowest paid apprentices. Campaign to create a million more jobs.SNP: Introduce gender quotas on public boards. Living wage ""a central priority"" in all Scottish government contracts. Continue the 'small business bonus'.Plaid Cymru: Provide rates relief for small businesses. Increase the number and value of contracts from Welsh public bodies that go to firms within Wales.UKIP: Allow firms to offer jobs to British workers first ""without the fear of being sued for discrimination"".Greens: A national energy conservation scheme to create thousands of new jobs. The party wants to create ""sustainable jobs"" and promotes more local production of food and goods.Education Conservatives: Protect England's schools budget - from reception entry at age four or five to the end of GCSEs at 16 - in cash terms although funding per pupil will not keep pace with inflation. Pre-school and post 16 education not ring fenced. Convert up to 3,500 more schools judged by Ofsted to ""require improvement"" into academies. ""War on illiteracy and innumeracy"". State primary schools in England that repeatedly failed to have a proportion of year-six pupil pass times tables and writing tests be forced to become academies, or have sponsorship replaced if already an academy. Opposed to giving votes to 16 and 17-year-olds for UK-wide general elections and local elections in England.Labour:  Increase the overall education budget in England, including schools, nurseries, Sure Start and provision for 16-to 18-year-olds, by at least the rate of inflation, although per-pupil funding is not specifically protected, meaning some of the increase will be eaten up by rising pupil numbers. Parents of primary school children would be guaranteed childcare from 8am to 6pm. The amount of free childcare for three and four year olds would be increased from 15 to 25 hours a week. Compulsory sex and relationship education in all schools. Refuse to grant business rate relief to independent schools unless they can show a ""meaningful impact"" on state schools through a new School Partnership Standard, for example by lending teaching staff or assisting in university admissions procedures. Committed to extending the franchise to 16 and 17-year-olds in elections across the UK. Double the number of Sure Start childcare places to more than 118,000. Tighten up the rules on primary school class sizes to ensure they do not have more than 30 pupils.Lib Dems: Protect the education budget from cuts. Guarantee qualified teachers and a core curriculum set by independent experts, as well as compulsory sex education, in all state schools including academies and free schools. More money for disadvantaged school children and free childcare for all two year olds. A two-thirds discount on all local bus fares for young people aged 16-21. Supports lowering the voting age to 16 in all UK elections.SNP: Guaranteed free 30 hours of childcare a week for three and four-year-olds in Scotland, up from 16 hours. Maintain lack of tuition fees at Scottish universities, and offer financial support in grants and loans to students. Continue to build and refurbish schools. Lower voting age to 16 in all UK elections.Plaid Cymru: Introduce a compulsory modern foreign language GCSE in secondary schools and the teaching of modern foreign languages in primary schools. Look at ways to strengthen the teaching of Welsh history and culture. Oppose foundation schools, academies and free schools. Look at moving from a per-pupil funding mechanism to a funding model based on the catchment area. Will not support any further increases in tuition fees for higher education students, and will seek the abolition of tuition fees as and when public finances allow. Supports lowering the voting age to 16 for elections to the Welsh Assembly and the UK Parliament.UKIP: More grammar schools. Scrap sex education for children aged under seven. Scrap tuition fees for students from poorer backgrounds who take degree courses in the sciences, technology, maths or engineering. Greater emphasis on vocational education with new Apprenticeship Qualification Option. School governing boards must be made up of at least 30% parents of children at the school. Allow universities to charge same amount for EU students as non-EU students.Greens: End performance related pay for teachers. Replace Ofsted with an independent National Council for Educational Excellence. Bring Free Schools and Academies into local authority control.

Withdraw Jobseeker's Allowance from young people after six months unless they take part in ""community projects"". And 18 to 21-year-olds wouldn't be entitled to housing benefit. Ban on zero-hours contracts which stop people getting work elsewhere. Raise the personal allowance - the point at which you start paying income tax - to £11,000 in April 2016 and then to £12,500 by 2020, which means that if you work on minimum wage for 30 hours you will pay no income tax. Young people out of work, education or training for six months will have to do unpaid community work to get benefits. This will apply to about 50,000 18 to 21-year-olds. Universal benefits for pensioners, such as free bus passes, TV licences for the over 75s and the winter fuel allowance. will once again be protected. Labour: Freeze energy prices until 2017. Increase in the minimum wage from £6.50-an-hour to £8-an-hour by 2020. Rises in child benefit capped at 1% for the first two years of the next parliament. Winter fuel allowance would be withdrawn from the wealthiest pensioners. Repeal what the government calls the spare room subsidy, dubbed the ""bedroom tax"" by Labour.  A million interest-free loans to help people insulate their homes. Rail fares would be capped. Double the amount of paid paternity leave available to new fathers from two to four weeks, and increase statutory paternity pay to £260 a week.Lib Dems: Raise the personal allowance - the point at which you start paying income tax - to £11,000 in April 2016 and then to £12,500 by 2020 (the Conservatives are promising the same thing). Nick Clegg has said he would not accept Conservative plans to freeze working-age benefits without taxing the rich too. He hasn't said he would block welfare cuts altogether. Withdraw eligibility for the Winter Fuel Payment and free TV Licence from pensioners on the 40% rate of income tax. A ""yellow card"" system to deal with benefit claimants breaking the rules, rather than imposing sanctions without warning.SNP: Oppose cuts to in-work benefits. Support moves to extend paternity leave. Introduce a maximum combined withdrawal rate for benefits and reforms to employment support allowance and cold weather payments. Protect policies such as concessionary travel for older Scots.Plaid Cymru: Move away from complex and expensive means testing for child-related benefits. Continue to campaign for the introduction of a living pension during the period of the next parliament for those aged 80 and over. UKIP: Only pay child benefit for the first two children for new claimants. Increase the Carers' Allowance to the same level as Jobseekers' Allowance (JSA) and pay a higher rate of JSA if you've been in work and already made tax and National Insurance contributions. Prevent anyone taking up permanent residence in Britain unless they're able to support themselves and any dependents they bring with them for at least five years and stop them receiving benefits. Stop paying child benefit for children who don't live in Britain. Scrap what UKIP calls the ""detested bedroom tax"". Boost ""credit unions"".Greens: The party backs a Citizen's Income, a fixed amount of £72 income a week to be paid to every individual, whether they are in work or not, to be funded by higher taxes on the better off and green levies.  But in the short-term it would increase the minimum wage to £10 by 2020. Ban zero hours contracts. Axe the ""bedroom tax"". Abolish the work capability assessment and restore the level of the former disability living allowance. Scrap the government's welfare cap, which limits the maximum amount a household can claim annually to £26,000 a year."

2015-04-07,Elephant trap?,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32047998,"The campaign has not even got under way, yet in the space of a couple of hours we have now been treated to not only one election pledge, but to two. The prime minister ruled out raising VAT if re-elected - while Labour said National Insurance contributions wouldn't go up.Usually politicians fudge the question of tax rises.  When he was leader of the opposition David Cameron himself said ""we have no need to raise taxes"" - before hiking up VAT after polling day.Famously, John Major said he had ""no plans"" to put up the sales tax -  before his chancellor did just that.And when he appeared in front of the cross-party Treasury committee of MPs on Tuesday, the current chancellor seemed to be continuing that tradition.  Under repeated questioning, George Osborne said: ""The policies we have do not involve a VAT rise.""That formulation appeared to give him not so much wriggle room, but an entire wriggle mansion.Labour assumed their campaign warning of further VAT rises to come under the Tories was very much on the money.But George Osborne's allies are suggesting privately that he had, in fact, been walking Ed Miliband to the edge of an elephant trap, then beckoning the prime minister to push the opposition leader in.Ed Miliband's strategists fully expected Mr Cameron to repeat the chancellor's obfuscation on tax at the final Prime Minister's Questions of this Parliament. They would then have expanded on the theme, inviting the prime minister to answer other difficult questions - then say he wasn't being straight with the British people for avoiding them.But the Labour leader was completely wrong-footed when first the prime minister said he would rule out a VAT rise and then counter-punched, inquiring if Labour would now rule out an increase in National Insurance contributions.Ed Miliband dodged the question and what could have been downbeat Conservative benches, uneasy over the prime minister's announcement this week of his retirement plans, were given something to cheer.The reason Ed Miliband didn't respond is because he was holding the National Insurance pledge back for Labour's manifesto.But that soon became unsustainable - so the other Ed, the shadow chancellor Ed Balls, had to undertake a hasty round of the TV studios to do just that.When I spoke to him mid-tour, he put on a brave face. His view was that George Osborne, having raised VAT from 17.5% to 20%, wanted to give the issue a low profile - whereas the prime minister had now made the mistake of putting it centre stage. And he believed David Cameron's promise would be judged against his past VAT-raising performance.He defended Ed Miliband's reluctance to talk about National Insurance as he felt it would have been ""inappropriate"" to announce Labour tax policy at PMQs.So the prime minister - always a better tactician than strategist - can at least satisfy himself that he smoked Labour out on NI and disrupted at least one entry in their election campaign grid.But the exchange actually raised more questions than it answered.If the main parties are ruling out further potential sources of revenue, but still committing themselves to eradicating a £90bn black hole in the public finances, will they now be under more pressure during the election campaign to spell out in much greater detail exactly what they intend to cut?"
2015-04-07,Who's next?,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32031343,"David Cameron's declaration that he will not seek a third term in office if he retains power in May has immediately stoked interest in who might fill his shoes when he's gone. Here are the likely - and perhaps less obvious - possibilities.Claim? As chancellor of the exchequer he's the man in charge of the purse strings and master strategist - and reportedly the PM's favourite to succeed him, although he hasn't said as much. Mr Cameron's right-hand man has had an image makeover of late, with a new haircut and a diet to shed some pounds. And he has seemingly recovered from his ""omnishambles"" Budget in 2012, with his latest - and last Budget - of the parliament giving the Tories a lead in some polls. He's said to be well liked among Conservative cabinet ministers and backbench MPs, whose support is vital for any candidate wanting to take on the party leadership. He shas some work to do among grassroots Tory members, however, coming fifth in ConservativeHome's latest online poll of party members on future leaders.Latest odds: 10/1 (according to William Hill)What's he said? ""The prime minister leads a strong team but what you see from him is answering a direct question with a direct answer. I think that's really refreshing. He says he's going to serve that full five years so the real question facing the country now is do you want the strong leadership of David Cameron that's delivering zero inflation and record jobs or do you want the chaos and incompetence of Ed Miliband.""Claim? The longest-serving home secretary in 50 years, she is only the second Conservative woman to secure one of the top four jobs in government. In her role, she has talked tough on immigration and crime and taken on the Police Federation. And she is popular with Tory activists, consistently occupying either first or second place in ConservativeHome's online polls on future party leaders. There have long been claims of Mrs May positioning herself for the top job, with reported tensions between her and the prime minister. Critics say she lacks charisma and micro-manages - while some cannot forget her coining the now infamous ""nasty party"" phrase at a Tory conference in 2002, but supporters say she is a formidable operator, and have dubbed her Britain's Angela Merkel. Latest odds: 9/2What's she said? ""My view is very simple, David Cameron is a first class leader of the party and a first class prime minister and I hope he is going to be doing that for a very long time."" (Desert Island discs, 23 November 2014)Claim? The blonde bombshell and mayor of London who can seemingly reach voters that others in the party cannot. Casting aside a rather chequered past he steered the capital through the 2012 Olympics, launched the successful and popular ""Boris bikes"" and got rid of London's ""bendy buses"" in favour of the new Routemaster double deckers. Mr Johnson hopes to revive his Westminster parliamentary career at the general election. He has been tipped by many to take the helm of the Conservative Party, and has not discouraged the idea. Like Theresa May, he is also a favourite among the grassroots of the party, pipping her to the top spot in ConservativeHome's latest poll of party members on future leaders. (he's ahead by 2 points). Critics say the gaffe-prone politician is not the right man for the job, but his supporters point to his wide-spread appeal.Latest odds: 9/4What's he said? ""I think what David Cameron is saying is banal and obvious. There has already been a leader of the Conservative Party for ten years and he's done an outstanding job. What he's saying now is that he wants to serve through to 2020 and that is frankly what we need him to do... five more years is what this country needs. I'm not entirely certain I see what the story is. He was asked a straight question, are you going to serve a third term like Mrs Thatcher or Tony Blair and he said no, because he thinks that ten years on top of British politics is an incredibly long time.""Claim? A self-made millionaire and devotee of Margaret Thatcher, he is regarded as one of the Conservatives' fastest-rising stars. The Treasury minister-turned-culture secretary became the first of the 2010 intake of MPs to reach cabinet level, and the first Asian male Conservative cabinet minister. He's currently polling well among the Conservative grassroots, who voted him third most preferable leader in ConservativeHome's latest online future leader poll. David Cameron recently said he wants to see a British Asian prime minister in his lifetime.Latest odds: 12/1Claim? Currently holding one of the four great offices of state - foreign secretary - Mr Hammond's name has often cropped up whenever talk of leadership contenders has emerged. He has built up an impressive CV in government since the Conservatives came to power in 2010, being first awarded the job of transport secretary before his promotion to defence secretary where he stayed for three years. He's regarded by many commentators as being a potential candidate for the Tory right. He seems to have work to do among party activists, scoring only 4% in ConservativeHome's future leader poll.Latest odds: 12/1"
2015-04-07,Cereal number,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-magazine-monitor-31962592,"David Cameron has declared he won't seek a third term as prime minister, citing an advertising slogan for Shredded Wheat used in the UK more than 30 years ago. What's its enduring power, asks Justin Parkinson.The hotel kitchen staff are in disbelief. Someone in room 147 has ordered three Shredded Wheat. The maid transports them upstairs to find England cricketer Ian Botham waiting at a table, dressed in full whites.The maid leaves. Botham hides one of the Shredded Wheat under a napkin and winks to camera. Cue music, as the slogan ""Shredded Wheat. Bet you can't eat three"" appears.This advert and others featuring football manager Brian Clough and the actor Richard Kiel, who played Jaws in James Bond films, have not run for some time. Nestle, which owns the brand, says the last probably aired in 1984.But their message seems to have waned little. Telling the BBC he would only serve a limited time in Downing Street, David Cameron said: ""Terms are like Shredded Wheat - two are wonderful but three might just be too many.""The prime minister's reprise was unlikely to be accidental, says Thayne Forbes, joint managing director of the brand-valuation company Intangible Business. ""Everybody would empathise with the view that three Shredded Wheat would probably be too much,"" he says. ""The slogan suggests people shouldn't overdo it. It sounds modest and reasoned.""As marketing goes, it might seem counter-intuitive, as it discourages excessive consumption. But it also sounds honest and unexploitative.Other advertising slogans and themes are in wide use in public and political discourse. Examples include Marmite being a by-word for divisiveness - a ""Marmite person"" is either loved or hated. Cameron has twice referred to Ronseal - the woodcare product that does ""exactly what it says on the tin"". But Shredded Wheat, its best-known slogan having lain dormant for so long, appears to be used less often. The cereal, created in the US in the 1890s, has long been sold as good for the evolving British lifestyle. A newspaper advert in 1902 described it as ""a relief from the monotony of everlasting porridge"", while, by 1943, it was ""an ideal food for all war workers"". The 1980s saw an emphasis on ""simple, honest goodness"", while, in the 2000s, its long heritage and reliability was promoted.""It's a good association for Cameron,"" says Forbes. ""He must have been brought up on it, like lots of other people. It will be great marketing for Shredded Wheat to have the slogan used after so many years, too.""Subscribe to the BBC News Magazine's email newsletter to get articles sent to your inbox"
2015-04-07,Are you 'cosmopolitan'?,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32021853,"The rise of UKIP heralds the emergence of a new divide in British politics, with cosmopolitan voters on one side and non-cosmopolitan ones on the other, argues Jeremy Cliffe.We hear a lot about UKIP these days. The party stole the show at the local and European elections last year, then again in the autumn when it lured two Conservative MPs to defect.  In the past weeks alone there have been three much-discussed television programmes about the party: ""Meet the Ukippers"", ""Farage Fans and UKIP Lovers"" and ""100 Days of UKIP"". At the upcoming general election the party will probably increase its share of seats in Westminster - and will certainly affect the results in dozens of other constituencies by taking votes from the other parties. But ask some of those academics who have been watching UKIP's rise, and they will tell you that it is just one part of a bigger story. We are all used to the left-right divide in politics: a spectrum of different views on how much the government should tax, spend, regulate and otherwise intervene in the economy. But according to Dr Rob Ford of Manchester University, UKIP exists on a different axis, one to do with cultural rather than economic matters. This new political scale is ever more prominent in British political life.Radio 4's Analysis programmeOn the one end of it is what you might call a ""cosmopolitan"" philosophy: a relaxed, liberal attitude to issues concerning national identity (like immigration) and to questions of morality and lifestyle (like gay marriage). On the other end is a ""non-cosmopolitan"" outlook: more nationalist, socially conservative and less comfortable with social change, or in other words the ideological stance often associated with typical UKIP voters. This divide cuts across the left-right scale: there are cosmopolitan and non-cosmopolitan voters in both the Conservative and the Labour camps, which is why UKIP takes support from both.Lots of things are making this cosmopolitanism divide more important. One is that the old class-based, ideological conflict between left and right has declined. Dr James Tilley of Oxford University argues that politicians are partly to blame. The economic philosophies of the Conservative and Labour parties are so similar, he argues, that other, cultural issues are becoming more important. Another factor is the growing gap between the generations: the difference in outlook between the cosmopolitan young and less cosmopolitan, older voters is greater than it was in the past (partly due to the recent rise in levels of university education, which tend to correlate with liberal views). This trend presents the established parties with some difficult questions. As Dr Ford puts it, they ""have to try and deal with this rising value divide, particularly now that UKIP has mobilised it into the political debate."" ""They have to make a move,"" he adds, ""but any move that they make risks making their position worse with one or the other of these groups of voters."" Sound too cosmopolitan, and the parties risk losing supporters to UKIP. Try to ""out-UKIP UKIP"", and they could alienate their younger, more socially liberal supporters. So both are doing the political splits, trying to reconcile the cosmopolitans within their ranks with the non-cosmopolitans. Witness the tortuous attempts by Ed Miliband to sound tough on immigration without sounding too tough. Witness, too, the recent struggles of David Cameron to persuade social conservatives in his party that gay marriage can be an innately conservative institution. In the long-term, this divide will become less problematic. That is because over the years the country will tilt towards the cosmopolitan end of this new spectrum. So says Penny Young of NatCen, the research organisation that conducts the extensive British Social Attitudes survey. Various demographic factors explain this trend. The country as a whole is becoming more accepting of same-sex relationships. Younger voters are more relaxed about things like immigration and national identity than were previous generations when they were young, suggesting that the overall population will tilt in an internationalist direction over time. And ever more parts of the country are acquiring the ethnic and social diversity once confined to the inner cities, a trend that generally makes people more comfortable with immigration. According to Dr Ford the question is therefore: how should the main political parties navigate this period of transition? It would be wrong to simply abandon the swathes of voters at the less cosmopolitan end of the scale; voters who are usually older and more isolated than the average member of the population.Yet the politicians do need to adapt to the changing attitudes of British society and be honest with voters rather than pandering to views that, deep down, they do not share. This quandary may not decide the upcoming general election, but in the established parties savvy strategists with an eye to elections in 2020 and beyond are grappling with it nonetheless. That is a wise move."
2015-04-07,Dudley debate,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32015334,"I met Afzal Amin for the first time on Friday, but I already knew who he was. In Dudley North, the seat he was selected by the Conservatives to fight in the general election, Mr Amin had become hard to avoid. When I first looked at the local newspaper online, the pages were surrounded by ""Amin"" logos in the preferred Tory shade of blue.Not long after we met, he asked me to pose for a photo, snapped by one of his campaign team, and doubtless rapidly tweeted out to followers of the would-be MP.Perhaps no surprise that the man running such a disciplined operation has served in the army and been to Sandhurst. That was very much the message he delivered on Friday, as he addressed school and college pupils at a hustings in Dudley which I'd been invited to chair.There was combative debate, too, not least with his Labour rival, the MP Ian Austin. Both men knew the Dudley contest was critical for their respective parties; Ian Austin held the seat by just over 600 votes in 2010. Just as David Cameron was denied a majority by failing to take seats like this one, so Ed Miliband is unlikely to be in No 10 if Labour loses Dudley North.He was self-confident and fluent. The only obvious mis-step came right at the end, when he interrupted Vicky Duckworth, the Green candidate for the neighbouring seat. She expressed the opinion that politics often seemed to be about men shouting at each other; Mr Amin complained she was engaging in gender bias.A few weeks ago, one Conservative MP who knows him well and respects his talents, said Afzal Amin had warned him of the risks of over-confidence. He thought he risked running before he could walk.Well, he stumbled badly this weekend. Whatever the purpose of his contacts with the English Defence League - and he strongly disputes claims that he wanted them to hold a protest that would then be called off, for which he could then take the credit - the exposure has damaged him and, potentially, the prospects of his party re-taking the seat.In February, the EDL staged a rally against plans for a new mosque in the town. As the Mail on Sunday story makes clear, Afzal Amin pleaded with them beforehand not to hold that demonstration; but it went ahead anyway. It's what happened subsequently which will feature in Tuesday's disciplinary hearing.Over the weekend, I put his defence to a very senior Conservative source - that this was an attempt to broker a compromise in order to bring together a divided community. The arch response: Dudley isn't Kandahar.Nor do I think from my visits to the town, where I'm going to be based for the general election, will people in Dudley appreciate being painted as somewhere riven by racial discord.True, Dudley was the scene of one of England's earliest race riots. But that was in 1962. Although the controversy over replacing the mosque - currently in a converted school and inadequate for the numbers who want to worship there - has been running for a decade, community relations are generally good. Even those who don't want a new mosque didn't want the EDL protestors - nor to be fair the anti-fascist counter-demonstrators who followed them.As for the Conservative Party, the view of the national leadership is that you don't collaborate with the EDL. Not least because the Tories are still struggling to bury some historic baggage in the Black Country: Enoch Powell was an MP in Wolverhampton when he delivered his Rivers of Blood speech about immigration in 1968.Four years before that, there was the notorious election in Smethwick which the Conservatives were accused of winning by wooing white voters with an offensive rhyme suggesting who'd they'd get as a neighbour if they voted Labour. Afzal Amin grew up in Smethwick so he should be aware of that history. He was, until his suspension on Saturday, one of about 17% of Conservative parliamentary candidates who are not white. The party is proud of that, but it's still struggling to translate that into votes.Afzal Amin may believe that he can persuade the party to lift the suspension when he meets party officials on Tuesday. I have my doubts. Even if they accept his defence, will the other parties be so charitable? The allegations would follow him on the campaign trail, and make planned visits by cabinet ministers next to impossible.On Friday, just before the hustings in Dudley began, Afzal Amin gave me his business card. It introduces him as 'prospective member of Parliament Dudley North'. I think I'll keep it; it could yet become a collector's item."

2015-04-08,Bid to change Speaker election rules,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32061097,"A last-minute bid to change the way the Speaker of the House of Commons is elected is to be debated by MPs.Labour criticised the government motion, to be debated on the final day before the dissolution of Parliament, saying the Conservatives were ""trying to play politics with the speakership"".Under the proposals, a secret ballot would decide whether there should be a contested election for the post.MPs currently have to file through the division lobbies to cast their vote.This means it is clear who does or does not back the incumbent as Speaker.Labour's shadow leader of the Commons Angela Eagle raised the party's concerns in the House on Wednesday evening, questioning whether the motion was within parliamentary rules.Current Speaker John Bercow is - technically - one of them, but many Tory MPs have never liked him.They resent his personal style and some believe he is far from impartial in the way he conducts business in the Commons.Attempts by some to force a vote on his resumption as Speaker in 2010 came to nothing. There have been the occasional measured jibes at him from the prime minister. Other Tories reportedly went much further and formed a group whose members had all been reprimanded by him. But the Speaker is a reformer who believes passionately that the people who elect the members, and pay the bills, should come first.The last act of the coalition looks like being an attempt to unseat him. And they are very serious about it.One Tory MP fighting an important marginal seat had been cleared by his party to be away from Parliament but he is now staying for the vote, such is the importance of it.She told Deputy Speaker Lindsay Hoyle: ""It's just come to my attention that the government has tabled a motion for debate on the final day of this Parliament, with no notice whatsoever to myself as shadow leader of the House, proposing changes to the way in which the Speaker of this House is elected.""Procedural matters in this House, with no consultation with the opposition, no consultation with the chair of the committee itself, for debate in only one hour tomorrow.""Mr Hoyle said the motion had been ""rightly or wrongly"" agreed to on Tuesday, saying that ""business of the House is decided by the government, not by the chair.""A spokesman for Commons Leader William Hague said the motion had been tabled as a free hour had opened up in Thursday's business after the House of Lords approved the Modern Slavery Bill.The proposed change would apply when a Speaker wishes to continue in the post after a general election.Under the current rules, if the Speaker's re-appointment is objected to, a division is held, with MPs choosing to back or oppose the Speaker in the division lobbies.The replacement of this method with a secret ballot was suggested in 2010 by a committee of MPs, which said the public method ""can be seen as a deterrent to the House expressing its views honestly"".MPs will now debate whether this change should be made."

2015-04-08,MPs warn on growth of UK jihadists,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32059813,"Not enough is being done to prevent people leaving the UK to join Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, a group of MPs has warned.Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said Britain must win their ""hearts and minds"".The committee's report comes as the BBC launches a database tracking British jihadists in Syria and Iraq. It shows that many people left in clusters from certain UK areas - often due to friendships and peer groups. The MPs' report argued that preventative work with communities, families and international partners was ""vital"" and needs to be a top priority for the Home Office.  ""The number of cases being brought to public attention should ring alarm bells,"" said Labour MP Mr Vaz.  ""This must be a relentless battle for hearts and minds, and without a strong counter-narrative we are in danger of failing to prevent even more departures. We are at the edge of a cliff."" The BBC has been tracking the stories of the men, women, boys and girls who have gone to Syria and Iraq to understand why they go, where they go from and what happens to them. By analysing around 160 profiles, it reveals the way in which people have travelled in clusters - a group of three young friends from Coventry, another group from Portsmouth, drawn out by one person they knew, others in Cardiff linked to people involved in an extremist organisation. Social media might play a part but face-to-face contact appears just as, if not more, important, according to the database.It includes the stories of: The BBC research emphasises the extent to which real-world contacts, rather than just online connections, are often a key driver of radicalisation and intent to travel to Iraq and Syria. Some of the experts who appeared before the Home Affairs Committee also argued the internet was a secondary influence. They said that universities and prisons were among the two most significant places where radicalisation occurred. A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police, which was not aware of the report, said it would have ""welcomed the opportunity"" to have given evidence to the committee and that it planned to look at the report in detail.The disappearance of schoolgirls Shamima Begum, Amira Abase, both 15, and Kadiza Sultana, 16, from east London in February, raised questions as to who could have done more to prevent their departure. After taking evidence from the police and the families of the girls among others, Mr Vaz said their case suffered from a ""lack of immediate action"". He added: ""Schools and the police must inform parents immediately, and work with them even if there is the smallest hint of radicalisation, or a close association with someone who is thought to have been radicalised.""However, the Met Police spokesman defended the speed of the police response to the schoolgirls' disappearance.  He said the committee's criticism was ""misleading"", pointing to the evidence given by both UK and Turkish authorities of ""rapid exchanges"" between the two.The committee's report said there needed to be an advice service which would be a less extreme step than calling the anti-terrorist hotline.The Association of Chief Police Officer's lead officer for the government's anti-terror strategy Prevent, Chief Constable Sir Peter Fahy, agreed that more needed to be done.However, he said the police ""do not have the capacity"" to routinely work with every school in the country.He added: ""The police service will play its part but the prime responsibility for dissuading young people from getting involved in extremist activity has to lie with parents, families and carers.""The committee also pointed to weaknesses in information sharing with airlines and other countries. It said greater care needed to be taken at airport check-in desks when people were travelling to destinations of concern - namely Syria, Somalia, Iraq and Nigeria, as well as neighbouring countries, such as Turkey. The report said police also needed to work faster to alert overseas partners and airlines when there were concerns over individuals.There were signs that some of the girls had followed extremist accounts on social media, the report said.The committee said that social media companies, such as Facebook and Twitter, should be prepared to suspend accounts when there is evidence they are being used to promote violent extremism.  The report also said it was disappointed the Home Office had not implemented a programme for individuals returning to Britain where there is evidence they had fought in Syria.Security officials estimate that some 600 Britons have left the country to join IS - and while around half may have returned, many are still out there - and some have died.  The BBC project includes detailed profiles of individuals which can be searched, based on hometown, age and gender, as well as those who have been convicted in the courts or who are believed to have been killed."

If not, the prince's private letters will either remain confidential, as the sender intended, or they'll be exposed to a large and inquisitive audience.

That will be a clear pledge from us.""He accused Mr Cameron of making an ""out of the blue, panicky"" announcement on VAT that ""no one in Britain will believe"".Labour, which has already announced plans to increase the top rate of income tax and impose a new ""mansion tax"" on high value properties, insists its plans are fully costed and will not require additional tax hikes if it wins May's general election.Mr Miliband began his final head-to-head encounter with Mr Cameron before the election by joking that the PM had ""announced his retirement plans"" - a reference to a BBC interview in which the prime minister said he would not serve a third term if the Tories remained in power.Challenging Mr Cameron to give a ""straight answer to a straight question"", Mr Miliband pressed him on whether he would rule out a rise in VAT after the election, as Labour had done.In response, the prime minister immediately said ""yes"", prompting loud cheers in turn from the Conservative benches. He contrasted what he said was a ""clear promise"" with Labour's unwillingness to rule out a rise in National Insurance.""I answered a very simple question about VAT. I ruled out an increase... straight answer to him, straight question from me. I have ruled out VAT. Will he rule out national insurance contributions. Yes or no?"" Mr Cameron added: ""We all know this is Labour's job tax. This is their tax of choice. This is what they clobber working people, families and enterprises with.""But Mr Miliband responded by saying there was ""only one person who is going to raise taxes on working families and that is him"".He said nobody would believe Mr Cameron on VAT ""because of his extreme spending plans, because his numbers do not add up and because he promised it last time and broke his promise"".Mr Cameron, he added, had broken other promises made before the last election to reduce annual net migration below 100,000 and not to pursue a major structural re-organisation of the NHS, adding that it was ""time for a better plan and time for a Labour government"".But Mr Cameron suggested a future Labour government would result in the ""chaos of economic crisis"", with Ed Miliband being ""held hostage"" by the SNP.The packed session provided a last opportunity for the two men to rally their MPs and set out their arguments before the start of the election campaign next week.Speaking after the exchanges and the other parties' tax pledges, deputy prime minister Nick Clegg said the Lib Dems ""don't need to raise VAT, national insurance or headline rates of income tax or corporation tax either"".""There are other taxes and other tax loopholes that we can increase or close in order to balance the books,"" he said.

2015-04-08,Met police 'had files on MPs in 90s',https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32044580,"A former undercover police officer has told BBC News that Scotland Yard kept intelligence files on MPs during the 1990s. Ex-Special Branch officer Peter Francis says he saw files on 10 Labour MPs which he and others regularly updated. He says he personally gathered information on three MPs as part of his work infiltrating left-wing groups. The MPs named, and Labour, have called for a forthcoming public inquiry into undercover policing to be widened. Mr Francis operated undercover between 1993 and 1997 in the Met's now disbanded Special Demonstration Squad. He was told to embed himself in left-wing groups or causes that were deemed to pose a potential threat to security. He says that during this period he was told to gather intelligence on MPs and their activities if and when they featured in any of his operations. That information, he says, was added to a special pink file that was available for Special Branch officers to read. Between 1990 and 2001, he claims to have personally seen records relating to Diane Abbott, the late Tony Benn, Jeremy Corbyn, the late Bernie Grant, Peter Hain, Harriet Harman, Ken Livingstone, Joan Ruddock, Dennis Skinner and Jack Straw.Four of the group became ministers during Mr Francis's time in Special Branch - including Jack Straw who was home secretary after 1997. ""When I was deployed undercover in the Special Demonstration Squad, any MP that I came across, such as on demonstrations, I would report back on them,"" he said. Mr Francis says that the files not only contained the MPs' publicly-stated political views - but also intelligence on what was going on behind the scenes in the party or their group. He says some of the information would have been things said in private by the MP, depending on how close each undercover officer had been able to get. Mr Francis said that when he first saw the files he understood that each had probably been created before the individual was an MP because of their personal involvement in radical causes or protests.But he added: ""When they became MPs these files carried on. It [was] your duty as an SDS officer to report back any intelligence that you come across. ""I felt that it was OK to report back on MPs,"" he said. ""I used to give myself a pat on the back, thinking 'I have done a good job'. These MPs were spied on and they should know.""""I don't think the police force should be monitoring MPs, full stop. I don't think we have any right to do that at all. It may be justifiable to say that the Security Service should be doing it - but I certainly don't think the police should be doing it.""Scotland Yard has refused to comment on the substance of the claims, but a spokesman said it had not shied away from serious allegations about the SDS. It said that Operation Herne, the internal police investigation into what happened in the unit, remained an ongoing investigation.""Operation Herne maintains that without speaking to Peter Francis it is simply not possible to fully investigate allegations he makes,"" said a spokesman. ""Operation Herne remains very willing to engage with him.""Mr Francis said that he has refused to speak to Operation Herne because he fears being interviewed under caution as a suspect, rather than a whistleblower. Scotland Yard told the BBC that Operation Herne detectives would be prepared to speak to him as a witness. He has, however, spoken to Mark Ellison QC who reviewed allegations about the SDS for the Home Secretary Theresa May - prompting her to launch a statutory inquiry. He says he will appear before those hearings. Peter Hain, who was a leader of the anti-apartheid movement in the late 1960s and 70s and became an MP in 1991, said he now wants full answers from Scotland Yard. ""I was deeply disturbed to find that files were still being kept by the Special Branch while I and others were serving Members of Parliament,"" he said. ""That is constitutionally an outrage. It infringes the sovereignty of Parliament. ""I want to see the home secretary widen the scope of the inquiry into the SDS to look specifically at the surveillance of MPs and the fact that there were active files on us while we were serving Members of Parliament. ""This should never have happened and it should have been reported and properly authorised - and we don't know whether it was.""Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper echoed the call for the inquiry to be widened in light of what she described as ""extremely serious and disturbing allegations"".""While undercover policing remains a crucial tool in combating serious and organised crime it must not be abused,"" she said.""There have now been a series of serious allegations about undercover policing - ranging from the treatment of Stephen Lawrence's family to police having long-term inappropriate relationships. ""We called some time ago for much stronger oversight of undercover policing and it is also vital to get to the truth about what has happened."" Mrs May announced earlier this month that Lord Justice Pitchford would lead the inquiry into the SDS allegations - but the precise shape of that inquiry is not yet clear.A Home Office spokesman said the review by Mark Ellison QC had unearthed ""serious historical failings"". ""That is why the Home Secretary established a public inquiry to thoroughly investigate undercover policing and the operation of the Special Demonstration Squad. ""Lord Justice Pitchford will consult interested parties to the inquiry over the coming months on setting the terms of reference, with a view to publishing these at the end of July.""Undercover policing is an essential tactic in the fight against crime but to improve the public's confidence in undercover work we must ensure there is no repeat of these failings in the future."""
2015-04-08,NHS problems worst 'since 1990s',https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/health-32057948,"Services in the NHS in England are deteriorating in a way not seen since the early 1990s, according to a leading health think tank. The King's Fund review said waiting times for A&E, cancer care and routine operations had all started getting worse, while deficits were growing.It said such drops in performance had not been seen for 20 years.But the think tank acknowledged the NHS had done as well as could be expected, given the financial climate.Professor John Appleby, chief economist at the King's Fund, which specialises in health care policy, said: ""The next government will inherit a health service that has run out of money and is operating at the very edge of its limits. ""There is now a real risk that patient care will deteriorate as service and financial pressures become overwhelming.""He said in terms of how standards were slipping - not how low they had reached - the situation was the worst it had been since the ""early 1990s"".The report noted much of the deterioration has happened in the second-half of the Parliament with many measures of performance being maintained in the first few years.It said the next government had to address the funding situation, adding the extra £8bn a year NHS England says is needed by 2020, was the ""minimum"" that would be required.The report - a review of performance this Parliament - highlights a range of problems as well as achievements. These include:The report is the second part of the King's Fund pre-election review of the NHS this Parliament.Last month it warned the coalition government's reforms of the health service had been ""damaging and distracting"".The King's Fund report should make worrying reading. The reference to the 1990s conjures up images of - for the NHS at least - a bygone era. The think tank's point was not that waiting times had reached the level they were at then, rather that this is the first time in two decades of almost continuous improvement that there has been a sustained drop in performance.In many ways, that had to happen. Services cannot keep getting better for ever. Nonetheless, the findings are crystal clear: the NHS is at a critical juncture. But what is less easy to determine is to what extent the coalition's policies have contributed to the difficulties.The think tank has already provided a critical analysis of the government's reforms - and when pushed, acknowledged the health service may have been ""in better shape"" if they had not happened.But the more significant issue for the health of the health service this Parliament has been the squeeze on finances. Even though the budget has been increased, it has felt more like a cut to many because demands have risen so quickly.On this though, the King's Fund accepted that the government's hands were tied. Given the state of the economy, ministers did as much as they could have.Read more from NickRoyal College of Nursing general secretary Peter Carter said politicians needed to take note of the warnings made by the King's Fund.""Morale is low, and more and more staff are being made sick with stress because of the intolerable pressure they are under,"" he added. Katherine Murphy, of the Patients Association, said: ""The findings echo what we are hearing on a daily basis on our helpline. It is clear to the public that the future of the NHS is one of the most important issues facing the nation and it should be a central issue in the election campaign.""Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham said: ""Five years ago David Cameron stood on a promise to protect the NHS. This report provides authoritative proof that he has broken that promise.""But a Department of Health spokesman said: ""As the King's Fund says, the NHS has 'performed well in the face of huge challenges', but if we are to continue to invest in the NHS going forward it needs to be backed by a strong economy.""

2015-04-08,SNP 'could block Tory government',https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32045419,"The SNP would block a minority Conservative government by voting down its Queen's Speech if it holds the post-election balance of power, its former leader Alex Salmond has said.Mr Salmond said the move could bring down the government if Labour joined in, with David Cameron ""locked out"".The Conservatives accused him of ""trying to sabotage the democratic will of the British people"".Labour has called his balance of power prediction ""bluster and bluff"".In recent days Mr Salmond, who is bidding to become a Westminster MP at the 7 May general election, has claimed his party could ""hold the power"" in a hung Parliament and would be able to influence the Budget of a minority Labour government.This was dismissed by Labour leader Ed Miliband, who has ruled out a formal coalition with the Scottish nationalists.The SNP currently has six MPs at Westminster, but recent opinion polls suggest its share could increase dramatically at the general election.James Cook, BBC News Scotland correspondentIf the Conservatives attempt to form a minority government and enough MPs vote against their Queen's Speech the administration would fall at the first hurdle and the leader of the opposition would have a shot at forming a government.That's how parliamentary democracy works in the event of a hung Parliament.And yet the Conservatives are saying that by planning to vote against a government he opposes Alex Salmond has ""confirmed he would sabotage the democratic will of the British people in order to make Ed Miliband prime minister"".It is part of their continuing attempt to portray Mr Miliband as a weak leader whose strings are being pulled by Mr Salmond.This kind of language causes despair among Tories north of the border who fear that the party in London is waltzing into an SNP trap.They know that many voters in Scotland will read the phrase ""democratic will of the British people"" and hear ""democratic will of the English people"".Because, if it is illegitimate for Scottish MPs, from whatever party, to vote against one government and support another in the British parliament, then what, voters may ask, is the point of the union?Who is dancing to Mr Salmond's tune now?Mr Salmond, the former Scottish first minister, told the New Statesman that in the event of a hung Parliament, a minority Conservative government would have to ""go straight effectively for a vote of confidence - usually the Queen's Speech, although it could be otherwise, of course - and we'd be voting against.""If David Cameron lost this vote, he said, there would be a two-week period for another government to be formed.BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said Mr Salmond had ""hardened his anti-Conservative rhetoric"" in the interview.A Conservative spokesman said:  ""Alex Salmond has confirmed he would sabotage the democratic will of the British people in order to make Ed Miliband prime minister. ""That would mean chaos for Britain, with weak Ed Miliband dancing to Alex Salmond's tune.""He said the ""only way to keep Britain together"" was to vote Conservative.Mr Salmond's latest comments come after Mr Miliband said the only people writing a future Labour Budget would be himself and shadow chancellor Ed Balls.Speaking in Clydebank on Monday, he added: ""It's not going to be Alex Salmond - not in a million years."""
2015-04-08,MPs criticise 'lack of EU debate',https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32045290,"The government's ""failure"" to let MPs debate EU legislation is ""deplorable"", a Parliamentary committee says.The European Scrutiny Committee said ministers had refused to schedule debates on issues such as free movement and the EU's Budget.It also said BBC coverage of EU matters should be ""improved substantially"".The government said the number of EU debates had doubled since 2009-10, while the BBC said its coverage was ""extensive and impartial"".The cross-party committee's role includes scrutinising EU documents and recommending the most important for debate in the House of Commons.Its report said in the period covering most of the 2014-15 financial year there were three debates on the floor of the House, compared with 12 in 2013-14.It also pointed out that not a single debate had taken place during a nine-month period, between 9 June 2014 and 9 March 2015.""The government's collective failure to schedule so many debates on EU documents over the past year is deplorable, and is a discourtesy to this committee and to all members of the House,"" the MPs said.Prime Minister David Cameron has sought to rally support from other EU leaders for his plans to curb welfare payments to European migrants ahead of a referendum on the UK's membership if he wins the general election.The committee said the government's ""cavalier"" approach was ""at odds with UK ministers' claims in their speeches across the EU about the role of national parliaments"".The Foreign Office said the government was committed to a ""strong EU scrutiny system that enables Parliament to hold it to account for the decisions taken in Brussels"".It added: ""We have made good on our commitment to raise standards by doubling the number of Europe debates on the floor of the House since 2009-10.""This government has also increased by around a fifth since 2010 the number of EU proposals that have been scrutinised and cleared by Parliament before being agreed in Brussels.""The committee has also been examining the BBC's coverage of European issues, taking evidence from director general Lord Hall and head of news James Harding earlier this month.During that appearance, Lord Hall said the desire for balanced output ""ran deep"" within the BBC and he believed that this was being achieved.Mr Harding said if the public was going to trust the BBC to report on politicians impartially it had to be clear that BBC journalists weren't ""asked by politicians to come and account for what they do and in effect do the bidding of those politicians"".But the committee said it was ""concerned about the manner in which the BBC treats EU issues"", calling for coverage to be ""improved substantially"".It suggested coverage did not reflect all sides of the debate on the European Union, and more analysis was needed. Its chairman, Conservative MP Sir William Cash, said the BBC had ""very particular obligations"" to be impartial and to ""educate and inform"".He added:  ""We do not believe this is currently being achieved in the context of the BBC's EU coverage.""A BBC spokesman said the corporation provided extensive and impartial coverage of European and Parliamentary issues, and it would be a breach of the corporation's independence if a committee of MPs instructed the BBC on its coverage."
2015-04-08,Lobbyists must 'conform' with rules,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32047992,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe woman in charge of the government's new register of lobbyists has said she expects the industry to ""conform"" with the statutory system. Speaking ahead of the register's launch, Alison White conceded a lot of lobbyists would not be listed on it.But she said her job was to make sure the rules were implemented and she would do so with ""extreme verve and vigour.""But one critic of the register said it was ""fake"" and full of ""loopholes"".Lobbyists are companies or individuals paid to influence government decisions.The coalition promised to introduce a statutory register of lobbyists when it came to power in 2010, and legislation was passed last year, with ministers saying the move would help clean up politics.However, the new register will only cover consultant lobbyists and will not apply to lobbyists working ""in-house"" for companies or organisations.A person or company will only need to be registered if they are contacting a government minister or permanent secretary in a government department - leading to criticism it will not come close to reflecting the scale or nature of lobbying that goes on across Whitehall.But Ms White, who is independent of the government, said her task was to implement the law as it stood not to question the powers she had been given. ""We are having something that has never been in place before,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""This is a statutory register. The industry tells me it is a professional industry. I expect them to conform with the legislation. It is my job to make sure they do so.""Ms White, who was appointed as the registrar of consultant lobbyists in September, acknowledged the register would not indicate different ""levels of lobbying"".""The legislation was quite narrowly drafted to address a particular issue, which was that it was not always particularly clear, when ministers were being lobbied, who the client of the lobbyist was. That is what the register was set up to do,"" she said.She added: ""This will give anyone who wishes to access the register the opportunity to be able to see who is lobbying and being paid for it and who their clients are. That is the main information the register will contain.""If a lobbyist sets out to influence government policy in some way, they would have to be registered. If they are not registered, then they would not be conforming. They have to go on the register before they lobby.""Ms White said last month that the register would not have any entries on its launch day but she had received more than ""20 expressions of interest"" about joining and companies and individuals might be required to sign up retrospectively.Potential registrants will be able to log on and create an account to file an ""information return"".But Tamasin Cave, from the Alliance for Lobbying Transparency coalition, said ""hardly anyone"" in the industry would be covered by the provisions of the new law. ""You have a huge commercial lobbying industry, and very few of them will have to sign up,"" she told Today.""The second flaw is that it won't show the interaction between lobbyists and government, and that is what a register is for.""It is to show the activity - who is discussing what with whom, but this shows nothing of this interaction. It is a fake register."""
2015-04-08,Car smoking ban MSP welcomes backing,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-south-scotland-32055226,"The Liberal Democrat MSP behind a bill to ban smoking in cars when children are present has welcomed the support of the Scottish government.South of Scotland MSP Jim Hume launched the members' bill in December.The government said it was ""very supportive"" of the principles of the bill, but changes could be needed to make it ""workable"".Motorists could potentially be fined £100 for breaching the rule if it becomes law.Mr Hume lodged draft proposals for a bill last May calling for a ban in Scotland on smoking in private vehicles when children under 18 were present.He said he was ""over the moon"" at the news the Scottish government would endorse the Smoking Prohibition (Children in Motor Vehicles) (Scotland) Bill.He said: ""With cross-party support and the support of many third sector organisations, there is every chance that this could be in place in the next year.""Eighty-four per cent of the 160 responses to my consultation were positive and people from across Scotland have expressed their support for the move.""The bill is about guaranteeing that children in Scotland can have the freedom to go on and lead healthy lives if they choose to.""I look forward to working with MSPs from all parties as the bill progresses.""Public Health Minister Maureen Watt said the Scottish government had considered including the measure in its Public Health Bill, but instead decided to support Mr Hume's proposals.She said: ""As with any bill, as it goes through the scrutiny process, there may be amendments and improvements to strengthen the legislation and ensure it is fit for purpose. ""But we believe that the underpinning principles are strong, and that is why I am pleased to support it.""Scottish Labour and a wide range of health organisations have backed his proposals.But the Scottish Conservatives have reservations about how the bill would work in practice.The party's health spokesman Jackson Carlaw said: ""While Scottish Conservatives support any moves which would protect young people from hazardous second hand smoke we have concerns as to how this would be enforced.""It would be a better use of resources to conduct a public awareness campaign similar to that which is being proposed by the government in Wales.""We will be watching this campaign in order to ascertain what lessons may be learned and what approaches may be adopted in Scotland.""Anti-smoking campaigners welcomed the Scottish government's backing for Mr Hume's bill.ASH Scotland's chief executive Sheila Duffy said: ""It is another public health initiative that can help Scotland move forward with its ambition to achieve a tobacco-free generation in 20 years' time.""It is popular with the public and will bring Scotland into line with upcoming legislation in England and Wales.""We believe it can be effectively enforced and that having the legislation focus on cars with children bypasses concerns over interference in people's private lives.""Jim Hume must be congratulated for taking the initiative on this proposal and for all the hard work he and his team have done to bring this important measure forward.""But Simon Clark, director of the smokers' group Forest, said the bill was ""legislation for legislation's sake"".He said: ""Smoking in cars carrying children is inconsiderate. The overwhelming majority of smokers know that and don't do it.""The very small number that do will carry on regardless because the law will be difficult, if not impossible, to enforce.""Education has to be better than legislation but the government prefers gesture politics and the big stick."""
2015-04-08,Candidate quits over UKIP MEP remark,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32038485,"A UKIP election candidate has quit the party over comments made by the party's only Scottish MEP about a Scottish government minister.Tim Wilson has decided not to stand in South Northamptonshire after David Coburn MEP compared Humza Yousaf to convicted terrorist Abu Hamza.Mr Coburn has apologised for the remarks, saying it was a ""joke"".A spokesman for UKIP said Mr Wilson had failed to emphasise local issues in his general election campaign.UKIP leader Nigel Farage said Mr Coburn's remarks were a ""joke in poor taste"" but he would not be taking any action against him.But Mr Wilson said he was disillusioned with the party over the ""racist jibes"" and has decided to stand down.He told BBC Scotland he was appalled by Mr Coburn's comments about Mr Yousaf and frustrated by the inaction of the party's leadership on the issue.  He said David Coburn had produced ""what I can only describe as an Islamaphobic insult, and that's simply not acceptable"".  Mr Wilson added: ""Of course he went on and apologised.  I think, frankly, that if you are in a position of power you have to be able to control what ideas emerge from your head and how they get to your mouth and, in fact, you shouldn't have those ideas in the first place.  ""But the real issue is that when Mr Farage was asked what he thought about this he dismissed this as a joke.  ""I don't think this is a joke. I think this is something very serious.  It may not be that this man intended to cause offence but we aren't interested in what his intentions are.  We are interested in the effect what he says has on other people and the effect is catastrophic, it's appalling and I've resigned.""In his resignation letter, Mr Wilson said he had been ""systematically gagged by the party whip"" and forbidden to speak about Islam favourably. A spokesman for UKIP said Mr Wilson had failed to put more emphasis on local issues in his campaign.He said: ""Whilst we had initially been optimistic about Tim Wilson's abilities as a candidate, it became obvious in recent weeks that he was out of his depth in representing our party in the way we would expect. ""Mr Wilson had clearly misunderstood the expectations that UKIP place on all of its candidates. Principal amongst those is focusing on issues that are relevant to local voters. UKIP put huge emphasis on local issues and Mr Wilson was unwilling to follow UKIP guidelines in this respect.""Last week MSPs at the Scottish Parliament unanimously condemned the remarks made by Mr Coburn during a newspaper interview.MSPs were debating a motion celebrating Scotland's diverse communities.The president of the European Parliament, Martin Schulz, condemned the remarks, saying they were ""not worthy of any elected member"". But a spokesman for the president said he could not act on remarks made outside parliament.The move comes just days after another candidate, Jonathan Stanley, quit in protest at the ""racist filth"" in UKIP. Mr Stanley, who was due to stand in the Cumbrian seat of Westmorland and Lonsdale, was the party's former head of policy in Scotland."

2015-04-08,Manifesto watch,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-29642613,"Political parties are putting together their manifestos for May's general election. Here's a guide to where they currently stand on the issues voters say they care about most (according to pollsters IPSOS Mori).ImmigrationConservatives:  David Cameron wants to make migrants wait four years before they can claim certain benefits, such as tax credits, Universal Credit, or get access to social housing. He wants to stop migrants from claiming child benefit for dependents living outside the UK, and remove those that have failed to find work after six months. Mr Cameron has promised to put reform of EU free movement rules at the heart of his renegotiation of Britain's relationship with the EU. He has ruled out a temporary cap on migrant numbers or an ""emergency brake"" on EU freedom of movement rules - ideas both mooted in recent months, saying this would be less ""effective"" than reducing the incentives for people to come to the UK. The party has a continuing goal to bring net immigration down to below 100,000 people a year (it currently stands at 243,000).Labour: ""Stronger"" border controls to tackle illegal immigration with ""proper"" entry and exit checks. ""Smarter"" targets to reduce low-skilled migration but ensure university students and high-skilled workers are not deterred. Employment agencies who only recruit abroad will be outlawed while the fines for employing illegal immigrants will be increased.Lib Dems: Reintroduce exit checks at borders, so the government can identify people who are overstaying their visa. Will require all new claimants for Jobseekers Allowance to have their English language skills assessed, with JSA then being conditional on attending language courses for those whose English is poor. Ensure that EU migrants have to ""earn"" their entitlement to benefits.SNP: Allow the devolved government to have control over immigration to Scotland, and introduce a Canadian-style earned citizenship system to attract highly-skilled immigrants.Plaid Cymru: Oppose a points-based system. Support the right of asylum seekers to work in Wales while they wait for status decisions to be made. Lobby the Westminster government to ensure that they shut ""detention"" centres.UKIP: Introduce an Australian-style points policy, used to select migrants with the skills and attributes needed to work in the country - covering people from inside and outside the EU. Bring net immigration down to 50,000 people a year. Priority lanes for UK passport holders. Increase UK border staff by 2,500. Tougher English language tests for migrants seeking permanent residence. Opt out of the Dublin treaty to allow the UK to return asylum seekers to other EU countries without considering their claim. Anyone who currently has the legal right to live, work, or study in the UK would not face deportation in the event of the country's withdrawal from the EU.Greens:  Progressively reduce UK immigration controls. Migrants illegally in the UK for over five years will be allowed to remain unless they pose a serious danger to public safety. More legal rights for asylum seekers.Taxes and the economyConservatives: Eradicate the deficit by 2018 and secure an overall budget surplus by 2019-20. Achieve this by spending cuts, not tax rises, while raising NHS spending. An income tax cut for 30 million people by 2020. Tax would start to kick in at £12,500 a year, instead of £10,500. This will cost £5.6bn. The higher tax rate, 40%, would start at £50,000 instead of £41,900, again by 2020, at a cost of £1.6bn. This will be paid for through £25bn in additional spending cuts and economic growth. No increases in VAT.Labour: Get the current budget into surplus and the national debt falling ""as soon as possible in the next parliament"". No additional borrowing for new spending. Reintroduce the 50p top rate of income tax for earnings over £150,000.  Cut income tax for 24 million people by bringing back the 10p rate, paid for by scrapping the Married Couples' Tax Allowance. Bring in a ""mansion tax"" on properties worth over £2m, to raise £1.2bn. A tax on bankers' bonuses. A 5% pay cut for every government minister. Push for UK overseas territories to be put on an international blacklist if they refuse to co-operate with a drive against tax avoidance. No increases in VAT or National Insurance contributions.Lib Dems: Raise the personal allowance - the point at which you start paying income tax - to £11,000 in April 2016 and then to £12,500 by 2020. ""Strict new fiscal rules"" to ensure the deficit has gone by April 2018, with the wealthy contributing the most. The Lib Dems invented the ""mansion tax"" but in contrast to Labour have set out how it would operate - along similar lines to council tax bands. There are also Lib Dem plans to increase capital gains tax - paid on profits from second homes or shares - from 28% to 35%. Impose an additional 8% rate of corporation tax on UK banks to raise an extra £1bn a year to help pay off the deficit.SNP: Oppose UK plans in the Infrastructure Bill which will allow oil and gas drilling and hydraulic fracturing beneath people's homes without consent. Invest in offshore wind farming. Support an international bank tax and limits to industry bonuses.Plaid Cymru: Build a Green Skills Construction College, specialising in green energy. Establish a publicly-owned energy company. Establish a publicly-owned Bank of Wales business investment bank. Enforce a living wage. Give devolved nations an equal say in institutions that affect everyone's lives, such as the Bank of England.UKIP: Increase the personal allowance to the level of full-time minimum wage earnings, about £13,500, by 2020. Abolish inheritance tax. Introduce a 35% income tax rate between £42,285 and £55,000, at which point the 40% rate becomes payable. Set up a Treasury Commission to design a turnover tax on large businesses. Cut foreign aid budget by £9bn a year. Scrap HS2. Save £8bn a year in membership fees by leaving the EU.  Lower the VAT rate charged on restorations to listed buildings.Greens: People earning more than £100,000 a year would pay 50% income tax. Wealth tax of 1% to 2% on people worth £3m or more. Renationalise the railways and energy companies. Scrap HS2. Allow councils to impose extra business rates on out-of-town supermarkets to fund small local businesses. Crackdown on tax avoidance by multinationals. Allow ""the current dependence on economic growth to cease, and allow zero or negative growth to be feasible without individual hardship"". Commit Britain to a ""zero carbon"" future. Cut rail and bus fares by an average of 10%. Enforce a cap on bankers' bonuses.The NHSConservatives:  Chancellor George Osborne says he will put an extra £2bn into frontline health services across the UK, which he described as a ""down payment"" on a plan drawn up by NHS bosses calling for an extra £8bn a year above inflation by 2020. In England, everyone would be able to see a GP seven days a week by 2020. Recruit 5,000 more doctors.Labour:  Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said Labour would commit an extra £2.5bn a year above Mr Osborne's plan. The money will come from three sources - a new ""mansion"" tax, clamping down on tax avoidance by big corporations and a new tax on tobacco companies. Patients in England would get a GP appointment within 48 hours and would not have to wait longer than a week for cancer tests and results. Scrap the Health and Social Care Act and end ""creeping privatisation"" of the NHS.  Integrate health and social care services into a system of ""whole-person care"". Give greater priority to mental health services. Replace the Cancer Drugs Fund in England when it runs out in 2016 with a £330m fund to improve access to innovative cancer drugs, surgery and radiotherapy. Recruit 5,000 more healthcare workers to help patients stay in their homes and introduce new safety checks to identify people at risk of hospitalisation. Prioritise child mental health by increasing the proportion of the mental health budget spent on children.Lib Dems: An extra £1bn for the NHS every year, to be funded by - amongst other things - making higher earners pay more tax on their shares. Half of this will go towards mental health. Ensure that spending on the NHS rises in line with growth in the economy. People who need therapy for conditions such as depression will be guaranteed treatment within 18 weeks. For young patients experiencing psychosis for the first time treatment will be provided within two weeks of being referred by a GP. This is all going to happen from April, with more mental health targets to follow if the Lib Dems return to government. Wants a cross-party review of the future of NHS funding.SNP: Reduce the number of senior managers in the NHS by 25% over the next parliament. Streamline the work of health boards. Real terms increases in year-on-year NHS spending.Plaid Cymru: Recruit 1,000 extra doctors to the Welsh NHS over two terms of a Plaid government. Offer financial incentives for recruiting doctors to areas and specialisms where there are, or are predicted to be, shortages. Encourage innovation and attract more research funding, in part by increasing research and development funding as government finance allows. Improve training for postgraduate doctors and stop them being used to ""plug gaps"" in staff rotas. More recruitment from within the EU to fill vacancies and using international doctors to staff the NHS while a new generation of Welsh doctors are trained.UKIP: An extra £3bn per year in NHS funding paid for by quitting the EU and through ""middle management"" cuts. Keep NHS free at the point of delivery. Stop any further use of PFI, and encourage local authorities to buy out their PFI contracts early where it is affordable to do so. Ensure all visitors and migrants who have been here for fewer than five years have NHS-approved medical insurance as a condition of entry to UK, with £200m of the £2bn saved to be spent on ending hospital parking charges in England. Bring back state-enrolled nurses and return powers to matrons. Monitor and Care Quality Commission to be replaced with elected county health boards. Stop spending £90m a year on gastric band and breast enhancement operations.Greens: Funding to be diverted away from centralised facilities towards community healthcare, illness prevention and health promotion.  Stop privatisation. Abolish prescription charges. Dedicated NHS Tax to go direct to the health service. Ban proactive recruitment of non-British NHS staff from overseas. A complete ban on the promotion of tobacco and alcohol products, including sponsorship.Security, defence and foreign affairsConservatives: Hold a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU by 2017, after negotiating the return of some powers from Brussels. Protect foreign aid budget. Replace Trident.Labour:  Push for reform of European Union and prevent Britain from ""sleepwalking"" towards exit. Commit in law to holding a Strategic Defence and Security Review every 5 years. Outlaw discrimination and abuse of Armed Forces personnel.Lib Dems: Campaign to reduce the number of Trident nuclear submarines. Push for greater European Union efficiency. SNP: Oppose nuclear weapons and push for removal of Trident submarines from Scotland. In 2010, proposed a Scottish Centre for Reconciliation and Conflict Resolution, to promote peaceful alternatives to armed conflict. Maintain 0.7% commitment to foreign aid. Enhanced role for Scotland within the UK in Europe, particularly in fisheries policy.Plaid Cymru: Honour commitment of 0.7% of budget used for foreign aid. Campaign for cancellation of developing countries' debts. Support the Fair Trade movement. Support the 'Tobin' or 'Robin hood' tax as a means of encouraging more responsibility and stability in the global markets. Reform the IMF and World Bank in order to improve regulation and accountability. Continue membership of the EU, but campaign for democratic reform. Support minority nations and minority language speakers around the world. Pass a Military Wellbeing Act to promote and safeguard the physical and mental health and wellbeing of military personnel.UKIP:  Leave the European Union. Remove the passports of any person who has gone to fight for a terrorist organisation and deport anyone who has committed a terrorist act. Cut foreign aid budget by £9bn. Create a Veterans Department to look after the interests of ex-service men and women.Greens: Referendum on Britain's EU membership. Want reform of EU to hand powers back to local communities. Boost overseas aid to 1% of GDP within 10 years. Scrap Britain's nuclear weapons. Take the UK out of NATO unilaterally. End the so-called ""special relationship"" between the UK and the US.  Stop EU-US free trade deal TTIP. JobsConservatives: Create three million apprenticeships to be paid for by benefit cuts.Labour: Guarantee a job for under 25s unemployed for over a year and adults unemployed for more than two years. As many young people to go on an apprenticeship as currently go to university by 2025. Create a million new high technology, green jobs by 2025. Ban ""exploitative"" zero hour contracts.Lib Dems: An extra £1 an hour for the lowest paid apprentices. Campaign to create a million more jobs.SNP: Introduce gender quotas on public boards. Living wage ""a central priority"" in all Scottish government contracts. Continue the 'small business bonus'.Plaid Cymru: Provide rates relief for small businesses. Increase the number and value of contracts from Welsh public bodies that go to firms within Wales.UKIP: Allow firms to offer jobs to British workers first ""without the fear of being sued for discrimination"".Greens: A national energy conservation scheme to create thousands of new jobs. The party wants to create ""sustainable jobs"" and promotes more local production of food and goods.Education Conservatives: Protect England's schools budget - from reception entry at age four or five to the end of GCSEs at 16 - in cash terms although funding per pupil will not keep pace with inflation. Pre-school and post 16 education not ring fenced. Convert up to 3,500 more schools judged by Ofsted to ""require improvement"" into academies. ""War on illiteracy and innumeracy"". State primary schools in England that repeatedly failed to have a proportion of year-six pupil pass times tables and writing tests be forced to become academies, or have sponsorship replaced if already an academy. Opposed to giving votes to 16 and 17-year-olds for UK-wide general elections and local elections in England.Labour:  Increase the overall education budget in England, including schools, nurseries, Sure Start and provision for 16-to 18-year-olds, by at least the rate of inflation, although per-pupil funding is not specifically protected, meaning some of the increase will be eaten up by rising pupil numbers. Parents of primary school children would be guaranteed childcare from 8am to 6pm. The amount of free childcare for three and four year olds would be increased from 15 to 25 hours a week. Compulsory sex and relationship education in all schools. Refuse to grant business rate relief to independent schools unless they can show a ""meaningful impact"" on state schools through a new School Partnership Standard, for example by lending teaching staff or assisting in university admissions procedures. Committed to extending the franchise to 16 and 17-year-olds in elections across the UK. Double the number of Sure Start childcare places to more than 118,000. Tighten up the rules on primary school class sizes to ensure they do not have more than 30 pupils.Lib Dems: Protect the education budget from cuts. Guarantee qualified teachers and a core curriculum set by independent experts, as well as compulsory sex education, in all state schools including academies and free schools. More money for disadvantaged school children and free childcare for all two year olds. A two-thirds discount on all local bus fares for young people aged 16-21. Supports lowering the voting age to 16 in all UK elections.SNP: Guaranteed free 30 hours of childcare a week for three and four-year-olds in Scotland, up from 16 hours. Maintain lack of tuition fees at Scottish universities, and offer financial support in grants and loans to students. Continue to build and refurbish schools. Lower voting age to 16 in all UK elections.Plaid Cymru: Introduce a compulsory modern foreign language GCSE in secondary schools and the teaching of modern foreign languages in primary schools. Look at ways to strengthen the teaching of Welsh history and culture. Oppose foundation schools, academies and free schools. Look at moving from a per-pupil funding mechanism to a funding model based on the catchment area. Will not support any further increases in tuition fees for higher education students, and will seek the abolition of tuition fees as and when public finances allow. Supports lowering the voting age to 16 for elections to the Welsh Assembly and the UK Parliament.UKIP: More grammar schools. Scrap sex education for children aged under seven. Scrap tuition fees for students from poorer backgrounds who take degree courses in the sciences, technology, maths or engineering. Greater emphasis on vocational education with new Apprenticeship Qualification Option. School governing boards must be made up of at least 30% parents of children at the school. Allow universities to charge same amount for EU students as non-EU students.Greens: End performance related pay for teachers. Replace Ofsted with an independent National Council for Educational Excellence. Bring Free Schools and Academies into local authority control.

Withdraw Jobseeker's Allowance from young people after six months unless they take part in ""community projects"". And 18 to 21-year-olds wouldn't be entitled to housing benefit. Ban on zero-hours contracts which stop people getting work elsewhere. Raise the personal allowance - the point at which you start paying income tax - to £11,000 in April 2016 and then to £12,500 by 2020, which means that if you work on minimum wage for 30 hours you will pay no income tax. Young people out of work, education or training for six months will have to do unpaid community work to get benefits. This will apply to about 50,000 18 to 21-year-olds. Universal benefits for pensioners, such as free bus passes, TV licences for the over 75s and the winter fuel allowance. will once again be protected. Labour: Freeze energy prices until 2017. Increase in the minimum wage from £6.50-an-hour to £8-an-hour by 2020. Rises in child benefit capped at 1% for the first two years of the next parliament. Winter fuel allowance would be withdrawn from the wealthiest pensioners. Repeal what the government calls the spare room subsidy, dubbed the ""bedroom tax"" by Labour.  A million interest-free loans to help people insulate their homes. Rail fares would be capped. Double the amount of paid paternity leave available to new fathers from two to four weeks, and increase statutory paternity pay to £260 a week.Lib Dems: Raise the personal allowance - the point at which you start paying income tax - to £11,000 in April 2016 and then to £12,500 by 2020 (the Conservatives are promising the same thing). Nick Clegg has said he would not accept Conservative plans to freeze working-age benefits without taxing the rich too. He hasn't said he would block welfare cuts altogether. Withdraw eligibility for the Winter Fuel Payment and free TV Licence from pensioners on the 40% rate of income tax. A ""yellow card"" system to deal with benefit claimants breaking the rules, rather than imposing sanctions without warning.SNP: Oppose cuts to in-work benefits. Support moves to extend paternity leave. Introduce a maximum combined withdrawal rate for benefits and reforms to employment support allowance and cold weather payments. Protect policies such as concessionary travel for older Scots.Plaid Cymru: Move away from complex and expensive means testing for child-related benefits. Continue to campaign for the introduction of a living pension during the period of the next parliament for those aged 80 and over. UKIP: Only pay child benefit for the first two children for new claimants. Increase the Carers' Allowance to the same level as Jobseekers' Allowance (JSA) and pay a higher rate of JSA if you've been in work and already made tax and National Insurance contributions. Prevent anyone taking up permanent residence in Britain unless they're able to support themselves and any dependents they bring with them for at least five years and stop them receiving benefits. Stop paying child benefit for children who don't live in Britain. Scrap what UKIP calls the ""detested bedroom tax"". Boost ""credit unions"".Greens: The party backs a Citizen's Income, a fixed amount of £72 income a week to be paid to every individual, whether they are in work or not, to be funded by higher taxes on the better off and green levies.  But in the short-term it would increase the minimum wage to £10 by 2020. Ban zero hours contracts. Axe the ""bedroom tax"". Abolish the work capability assessment and restore the level of the former disability living allowance. Scrap the government's welfare cap, which limits the maximum amount a household can claim annually to £26,000 a year."

2015-04-08,Elephant trap?,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32047998,"The campaign has not even got under way, yet in the space of a couple of hours we have now been treated to not only one election pledge, but to two. The prime minister ruled out raising VAT if re-elected - while Labour said National Insurance contributions wouldn't go up.Usually politicians fudge the question of tax rises.  When he was leader of the opposition David Cameron himself said ""we have no need to raise taxes"" - before hiking up VAT after polling day.Famously, John Major said he had ""no plans"" to put up the sales tax -  before his chancellor did just that.And when he appeared in front of the cross-party Treasury committee of MPs on Tuesday, the current chancellor seemed to be continuing that tradition.  Under repeated questioning, George Osborne said: ""The policies we have do not involve a VAT rise.""That formulation appeared to give him not so much wriggle room, but an entire wriggle mansion.Labour assumed their campaign warning of further VAT rises to come under the Tories was very much on the money.But George Osborne's allies are suggesting privately that he had, in fact, been walking Ed Miliband to the edge of an elephant trap, then beckoning the prime minister to push the opposition leader in.Ed Miliband's strategists fully expected Mr Cameron to repeat the chancellor's obfuscation on tax at the final Prime Minister's Questions of this Parliament. They would then have expanded on the theme, inviting the prime minister to answer other difficult questions - then say he wasn't being straight with the British people for avoiding them.But the Labour leader was completely wrong-footed when first the prime minister said he would rule out a VAT rise and then counter-punched, inquiring if Labour would now rule out an increase in National Insurance contributions.Ed Miliband dodged the question and what could have been downbeat Conservative benches, uneasy over the prime minister's announcement this week of his retirement plans, were given something to cheer.The reason Ed Miliband didn't respond is because he was holding the National Insurance pledge back for Labour's manifesto.But that soon became unsustainable - so the other Ed, the shadow chancellor Ed Balls, had to undertake a hasty round of the TV studios to do just that.When I spoke to him mid-tour, he put on a brave face. His view was that George Osborne, having raised VAT from 17.5% to 20%, wanted to give the issue a low profile - whereas the prime minister had now made the mistake of putting it centre stage. And he believed David Cameron's promise would be judged against his past VAT-raising performance.He defended Ed Miliband's reluctance to talk about National Insurance as he felt it would have been ""inappropriate"" to announce Labour tax policy at PMQs.So the prime minister - always a better tactician than strategist - can at least satisfy himself that he smoked Labour out on NI and disrupted at least one entry in their election campaign grid.But the exchange actually raised more questions than it answered.If the main parties are ruling out further potential sources of revenue, but still committing themselves to eradicating a £90bn black hole in the public finances, will they now be under more pressure during the election campaign to spell out in much greater detail exactly what they intend to cut?"
2015-04-08,Who's next?,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32031343,"David Cameron's declaration that he will not seek a third term in office if he retains power in May has immediately stoked interest in who might fill his shoes when he's gone. Here are the likely - and perhaps less obvious - possibilities.Claim? As chancellor of the exchequer he's the man in charge of the purse strings and master strategist - and reportedly the PM's favourite to succeed him, although he hasn't said as much. Mr Cameron's right-hand man has had an image makeover of late, with a new haircut and a diet to shed some pounds. And he has seemingly recovered from his ""omnishambles"" Budget in 2012, with his latest - and last Budget - of the parliament giving the Tories a lead in some polls. He's said to be well liked among Conservative cabinet ministers and backbench MPs, whose support is vital for any candidate wanting to take on the party leadership. He shas some work to do among grassroots Tory members, however, coming fifth in ConservativeHome's latest online poll of party members on future leaders.Latest odds: 10/1 (according to William Hill)What's he said? ""The prime minister leads a strong team but what you see from him is answering a direct question with a direct answer. I think that's really refreshing. He says he's going to serve that full five years so the real question facing the country now is do you want the strong leadership of David Cameron that's delivering zero inflation and record jobs or do you want the chaos and incompetence of Ed Miliband.""Claim? The longest-serving home secretary in 50 years, she is only the second Conservative woman to secure one of the top four jobs in government. In her role, she has talked tough on immigration and crime and taken on the Police Federation. And she is popular with Tory activists, consistently occupying either first or second place in ConservativeHome's online polls on future party leaders. There have long been claims of Mrs May positioning herself for the top job, with reported tensions between her and the prime minister. Critics say she lacks charisma and micro-manages - while some cannot forget her coining the now infamous ""nasty party"" phrase at a Tory conference in 2002, but supporters say she is a formidable operator, and have dubbed her Britain's Angela Merkel. Latest odds: 9/2What's she said? ""My view is very simple, David Cameron is a first class leader of the party and a first class prime minister and I hope he is going to be doing that for a very long time."" (Desert Island discs, 23 November 2014)Claim? The blonde bombshell and mayor of London who can seemingly reach voters that others in the party cannot. Casting aside a rather chequered past he steered the capital through the 2012 Olympics, launched the successful and popular ""Boris bikes"" and got rid of London's ""bendy buses"" in favour of the new Routemaster double deckers. Mr Johnson hopes to revive his Westminster parliamentary career at the general election. He has been tipped by many to take the helm of the Conservative Party, and has not discouraged the idea. Like Theresa May, he is also a favourite among the grassroots of the party, pipping her to the top spot in ConservativeHome's latest poll of party members on future leaders. (he's ahead by 2 points). Critics say the gaffe-prone politician is not the right man for the job, but his supporters point to his wide-spread appeal.Latest odds: 9/4What's he said? ""I think what David Cameron is saying is banal and obvious. There has already been a leader of the Conservative Party for ten years and he's done an outstanding job. What he's saying now is that he wants to serve through to 2020 and that is frankly what we need him to do... five more years is what this country needs. I'm not entirely certain I see what the story is. He was asked a straight question, are you going to serve a third term like Mrs Thatcher or Tony Blair and he said no, because he thinks that ten years on top of British politics is an incredibly long time.""Claim? A self-made millionaire and devotee of Margaret Thatcher, he is regarded as one of the Conservatives' fastest-rising stars. The Treasury minister-turned-culture secretary became the first of the 2010 intake of MPs to reach cabinet level, and the first Asian male Conservative cabinet minister. He's currently polling well among the Conservative grassroots, who voted him third most preferable leader in ConservativeHome's latest online future leader poll. David Cameron recently said he wants to see a British Asian prime minister in his lifetime.Latest odds: 12/1Claim? Currently holding one of the four great offices of state - foreign secretary - Mr Hammond's name has often cropped up whenever talk of leadership contenders has emerged. He has built up an impressive CV in government since the Conservatives came to power in 2010, being first awarded the job of transport secretary before his promotion to defence secretary where he stayed for three years. He's regarded by many commentators as being a potential candidate for the Tory right. He seems to have work to do among party activists, scoring only 4% in ConservativeHome's future leader poll.Latest odds: 12/1"
2015-04-08,Cereal number,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-magazine-monitor-31962592,"David Cameron has declared he won't seek a third term as prime minister, citing an advertising slogan for Shredded Wheat used in the UK more than 30 years ago. What's its enduring power, asks Justin Parkinson.The hotel kitchen staff are in disbelief. Someone in room 147 has ordered three Shredded Wheat. The maid transports them upstairs to find England cricketer Ian Botham waiting at a table, dressed in full whites.The maid leaves. Botham hides one of the Shredded Wheat under a napkin and winks to camera. Cue music, as the slogan ""Shredded Wheat. Bet you can't eat three"" appears.This advert and others featuring football manager Brian Clough and the actor Richard Kiel, who played Jaws in James Bond films, have not run for some time. Nestle, which owns the brand, says the last probably aired in 1984.But their message seems to have waned little. Telling the BBC he would only serve a limited time in Downing Street, David Cameron said: ""Terms are like Shredded Wheat - two are wonderful but three might just be too many.""The prime minister's reprise was unlikely to be accidental, says Thayne Forbes, joint managing director of the brand-valuation company Intangible Business. ""Everybody would empathise with the view that three Shredded Wheat would probably be too much,"" he says. ""The slogan suggests people shouldn't overdo it. It sounds modest and reasoned.""As marketing goes, it might seem counter-intuitive, as it discourages excessive consumption. But it also sounds honest and unexploitative.Other advertising slogans and themes are in wide use in public and political discourse. Examples include Marmite being a by-word for divisiveness - a ""Marmite person"" is either loved or hated. Cameron has twice referred to Ronseal - the woodcare product that does ""exactly what it says on the tin"". But Shredded Wheat, its best-known slogan having lain dormant for so long, appears to be used less often. The cereal, created in the US in the 1890s, has long been sold as good for the evolving British lifestyle. A newspaper advert in 1902 described it as ""a relief from the monotony of everlasting porridge"", while, by 1943, it was ""an ideal food for all war workers"". The 1980s saw an emphasis on ""simple, honest goodness"", while, in the 2000s, its long heritage and reliability was promoted.""It's a good association for Cameron,"" says Forbes. ""He must have been brought up on it, like lots of other people. It will be great marketing for Shredded Wheat to have the slogan used after so many years, too.""Subscribe to the BBC News Magazine's email newsletter to get articles sent to your inbox"
2015-04-08,Are you 'cosmopolitan'?,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32021853,"The rise of UKIP heralds the emergence of a new divide in British politics, with cosmopolitan voters on one side and non-cosmopolitan ones on the other, argues Jeremy Cliffe.We hear a lot about UKIP these days. The party stole the show at the local and European elections last year, then again in the autumn when it lured two Conservative MPs to defect.  In the past weeks alone there have been three much-discussed television programmes about the party: ""Meet the Ukippers"", ""Farage Fans and UKIP Lovers"" and ""100 Days of UKIP"". At the upcoming general election the party will probably increase its share of seats in Westminster - and will certainly affect the results in dozens of other constituencies by taking votes from the other parties. But ask some of those academics who have been watching UKIP's rise, and they will tell you that it is just one part of a bigger story. We are all used to the left-right divide in politics: a spectrum of different views on how much the government should tax, spend, regulate and otherwise intervene in the economy. But according to Dr Rob Ford of Manchester University, UKIP exists on a different axis, one to do with cultural rather than economic matters. This new political scale is ever more prominent in British political life.Radio 4's Analysis programmeOn the one end of it is what you might call a ""cosmopolitan"" philosophy: a relaxed, liberal attitude to issues concerning national identity (like immigration) and to questions of morality and lifestyle (like gay marriage). On the other end is a ""non-cosmopolitan"" outlook: more nationalist, socially conservative and less comfortable with social change, or in other words the ideological stance often associated with typical UKIP voters. This divide cuts across the left-right scale: there are cosmopolitan and non-cosmopolitan voters in both the Conservative and the Labour camps, which is why UKIP takes support from both.Lots of things are making this cosmopolitanism divide more important. One is that the old class-based, ideological conflict between left and right has declined. Dr James Tilley of Oxford University argues that politicians are partly to blame. The economic philosophies of the Conservative and Labour parties are so similar, he argues, that other, cultural issues are becoming more important. Another factor is the growing gap between the generations: the difference in outlook between the cosmopolitan young and less cosmopolitan, older voters is greater than it was in the past (partly due to the recent rise in levels of university education, which tend to correlate with liberal views). This trend presents the established parties with some difficult questions. As Dr Ford puts it, they ""have to try and deal with this rising value divide, particularly now that UKIP has mobilised it into the political debate."" ""They have to make a move,"" he adds, ""but any move that they make risks making their position worse with one or the other of these groups of voters."" Sound too cosmopolitan, and the parties risk losing supporters to UKIP. Try to ""out-UKIP UKIP"", and they could alienate their younger, more socially liberal supporters. So both are doing the political splits, trying to reconcile the cosmopolitans within their ranks with the non-cosmopolitans. Witness the tortuous attempts by Ed Miliband to sound tough on immigration without sounding too tough. Witness, too, the recent struggles of David Cameron to persuade social conservatives in his party that gay marriage can be an innately conservative institution. In the long-term, this divide will become less problematic. That is because over the years the country will tilt towards the cosmopolitan end of this new spectrum. So says Penny Young of NatCen, the research organisation that conducts the extensive British Social Attitudes survey. Various demographic factors explain this trend. The country as a whole is becoming more accepting of same-sex relationships. Younger voters are more relaxed about things like immigration and national identity than were previous generations when they were young, suggesting that the overall population will tilt in an internationalist direction over time. And ever more parts of the country are acquiring the ethnic and social diversity once confined to the inner cities, a trend that generally makes people more comfortable with immigration. According to Dr Ford the question is therefore: how should the main political parties navigate this period of transition? It would be wrong to simply abandon the swathes of voters at the less cosmopolitan end of the scale; voters who are usually older and more isolated than the average member of the population.Yet the politicians do need to adapt to the changing attitudes of British society and be honest with voters rather than pandering to views that, deep down, they do not share. This quandary may not decide the upcoming general election, but in the established parties savvy strategists with an eye to elections in 2020 and beyond are grappling with it nonetheless. That is a wise move."
2015-04-08,Dudley debate,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32015334,"I met Afzal Amin for the first time on Friday, but I already knew who he was. In Dudley North, the seat he was selected by the Conservatives to fight in the general election, Mr Amin had become hard to avoid. When I first looked at the local newspaper online, the pages were surrounded by ""Amin"" logos in the preferred Tory shade of blue.Not long after we met, he asked me to pose for a photo, snapped by one of his campaign team, and doubtless rapidly tweeted out to followers of the would-be MP.Perhaps no surprise that the man running such a disciplined operation has served in the army and been to Sandhurst. That was very much the message he delivered on Friday, as he addressed school and college pupils at a hustings in Dudley which I'd been invited to chair.There was combative debate, too, not least with his Labour rival, the MP Ian Austin. Both men knew the Dudley contest was critical for their respective parties; Ian Austin held the seat by just over 600 votes in 2010. Just as David Cameron was denied a majority by failing to take seats like this one, so Ed Miliband is unlikely to be in No 10 if Labour loses Dudley North.He was self-confident and fluent. The only obvious mis-step came right at the end, when he interrupted Vicky Duckworth, the Green candidate for the neighbouring seat. She expressed the opinion that politics often seemed to be about men shouting at each other; Mr Amin complained she was engaging in gender bias.A few weeks ago, one Conservative MP who knows him well and respects his talents, said Afzal Amin had warned him of the risks of over-confidence. He thought he risked running before he could walk.Well, he stumbled badly this weekend. Whatever the purpose of his contacts with the English Defence League - and he strongly disputes claims that he wanted them to hold a protest that would then be called off, for which he could then take the credit - the exposure has damaged him and, potentially, the prospects of his party re-taking the seat.In February, the EDL staged a rally against plans for a new mosque in the town. As the Mail on Sunday story makes clear, Afzal Amin pleaded with them beforehand not to hold that demonstration; but it went ahead anyway. It's what happened subsequently which will feature in Tuesday's disciplinary hearing.Over the weekend, I put his defence to a very senior Conservative source - that this was an attempt to broker a compromise in order to bring together a divided community. The arch response: Dudley isn't Kandahar.Nor do I think from my visits to the town, where I'm going to be based for the general election, will people in Dudley appreciate being painted as somewhere riven by racial discord.True, Dudley was the scene of one of England's earliest race riots. But that was in 1962. Although the controversy over replacing the mosque - currently in a converted school and inadequate for the numbers who want to worship there - has been running for a decade, community relations are generally good. Even those who don't want a new mosque didn't want the EDL protestors - nor to be fair the anti-fascist counter-demonstrators who followed them.As for the Conservative Party, the view of the national leadership is that you don't collaborate with the EDL. Not least because the Tories are still struggling to bury some historic baggage in the Black Country: Enoch Powell was an MP in Wolverhampton when he delivered his Rivers of Blood speech about immigration in 1968.Four years before that, there was the notorious election in Smethwick which the Conservatives were accused of winning by wooing white voters with an offensive rhyme suggesting who'd they'd get as a neighbour if they voted Labour. Afzal Amin grew up in Smethwick so he should be aware of that history. He was, until his suspension on Saturday, one of about 17% of Conservative parliamentary candidates who are not white. The party is proud of that, but it's still struggling to translate that into votes.Afzal Amin may believe that he can persuade the party to lift the suspension when he meets party officials on Tuesday. I have my doubts. Even if they accept his defence, will the other parties be so charitable? The allegations would follow him on the campaign trail, and make planned visits by cabinet ministers next to impossible.On Friday, just before the hustings in Dudley began, Afzal Amin gave me his business card. It introduces him as 'prospective member of Parliament Dudley North'. I think I'll keep it; it could yet become a collector's item."

2015-04-09,Bid to change Speaker election rules,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32061097,"A last-minute bid to change the way the Speaker of the House of Commons is elected is to be debated by MPs.Labour criticised the government motion, to be debated on the final day before the dissolution of Parliament, saying the Conservatives were ""trying to play politics with the speakership"".Under the proposals, a secret ballot would decide whether there should be a contested election for the post.MPs currently have to file through the division lobbies to cast their vote.This means it is clear who does or does not back the incumbent as Speaker.Labour's shadow leader of the Commons Angela Eagle raised the party's concerns in the House on Wednesday evening, questioning whether the motion was within parliamentary rules.Current Speaker John Bercow is - technically - one of them, but many Tory MPs have never liked him.They resent his personal style and some believe he is far from impartial in the way he conducts business in the Commons.Attempts by some to force a vote on his resumption as Speaker in 2010 came to nothing. There have been the occasional measured jibes at him from the prime minister. Other Tories reportedly went much further and formed a group whose members had all been reprimanded by him. But the Speaker is a reformer who believes passionately that the people who elect the members, and pay the bills, should come first.The last act of the coalition looks like being an attempt to unseat him. And they are very serious about it.One Tory MP fighting an important marginal seat had been cleared by his party to be away from Parliament but he is now staying for the vote, such is the importance of it.She told Deputy Speaker Lindsay Hoyle: ""It's just come to my attention that the government has tabled a motion for debate on the final day of this Parliament, with no notice whatsoever to myself as shadow leader of the House, proposing changes to the way in which the Speaker of this House is elected.""Procedural matters in this House, with no consultation with the opposition, no consultation with the chair of the committee itself, for debate in only one hour tomorrow.""Mr Hoyle said the motion had been ""rightly or wrongly"" agreed to on Tuesday, saying that ""business of the House is decided by the government, not by the chair.""A spokesman for Commons Leader William Hague said the motion had been tabled as a free hour had opened up in Thursday's business after the House of Lords approved the Modern Slavery Bill.The proposed change would apply when a Speaker wishes to continue in the post after a general election.Under the current rules, if the Speaker's re-appointment is objected to, a division is held, with MPs choosing to back or oppose the Speaker in the division lobbies.The replacement of this method with a secret ballot was suggested in 2010 by a committee of MPs, which said the public method ""can be seen as a deterrent to the House expressing its views honestly"".MPs will now debate whether this change should be made."

2015-04-09,MPs warn on growth of UK jihadists,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32059813,"Not enough is being done to prevent people leaving the UK to join Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, a group of MPs has warned.Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said Britain must win their ""hearts and minds"".The committee's report comes as the BBC launches a database tracking British jihadists in Syria and Iraq. It shows that many people left in clusters from certain UK areas - often due to friendships and peer groups. The MPs' report argued that preventative work with communities, families and international partners was ""vital"" and needs to be a top priority for the Home Office.  ""The number of cases being brought to public attention should ring alarm bells,"" said Labour MP Mr Vaz.  ""This must be a relentless battle for hearts and minds, and without a strong counter-narrative we are in danger of failing to prevent even more departures. We are at the edge of a cliff."" The BBC has been tracking the stories of the men, women, boys and girls who have gone to Syria and Iraq to understand why they go, where they go from and what happens to them. By analysing around 160 profiles, it reveals the way in which people have travelled in clusters - a group of three young friends from Coventry, another group from Portsmouth, drawn out by one person they knew, others in Cardiff linked to people involved in an extremist organisation. Social media might play a part but face-to-face contact appears just as, if not more, important, according to the database.It includes the stories of: The BBC research emphasises the extent to which real-world contacts, rather than just online connections, are often a key driver of radicalisation and intent to travel to Iraq and Syria. Some of the experts who appeared before the Home Affairs Committee also argued the internet was a secondary influence. They said that universities and prisons were among the two most significant places where radicalisation occurred. A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police, which was not aware of the report, said it would have ""welcomed the opportunity"" to have given evidence to the committee and that it planned to look at the report in detail.The disappearance of schoolgirls Shamima Begum, Amira Abase, both 15, and Kadiza Sultana, 16, from east London in February, raised questions as to who could have done more to prevent their departure. After taking evidence from the police and the families of the girls among others, Mr Vaz said their case suffered from a ""lack of immediate action"". He added: ""Schools and the police must inform parents immediately, and work with them even if there is the smallest hint of radicalisation, or a close association with someone who is thought to have been radicalised.""However, the Met Police spokesman defended the speed of the police response to the schoolgirls' disappearance.  He said the committee's criticism was ""misleading"", pointing to the evidence given by both UK and Turkish authorities of ""rapid exchanges"" between the two.The committee's report said there needed to be an advice service which would be a less extreme step than calling the anti-terrorist hotline.The Association of Chief Police Officer's lead officer for the government's anti-terror strategy Prevent, Chief Constable Sir Peter Fahy, agreed that more needed to be done.However, he said the police ""do not have the capacity"" to routinely work with every school in the country.He added: ""The police service will play its part but the prime responsibility for dissuading young people from getting involved in extremist activity has to lie with parents, families and carers.""The committee also pointed to weaknesses in information sharing with airlines and other countries. It said greater care needed to be taken at airport check-in desks when people were travelling to destinations of concern - namely Syria, Somalia, Iraq and Nigeria, as well as neighbouring countries, such as Turkey. The report said police also needed to work faster to alert overseas partners and airlines when there were concerns over individuals.There were signs that some of the girls had followed extremist accounts on social media, the report said.The committee said that social media companies, such as Facebook and Twitter, should be prepared to suspend accounts when there is evidence they are being used to promote violent extremism.  The report also said it was disappointed the Home Office had not implemented a programme for individuals returning to Britain where there is evidence they had fought in Syria.Security officials estimate that some 600 Britons have left the country to join IS - and while around half may have returned, many are still out there - and some have died.  The BBC project includes detailed profiles of individuals which can be searched, based on hometown, age and gender, as well as those who have been convicted in the courts or who are believed to have been killed."

If not, the prince's private letters will either remain confidential, as the sender intended, or they'll be exposed to a large and inquisitive audience.

That will be a clear pledge from us.""He accused Mr Cameron of making an ""out of the blue, panicky"" announcement on VAT that ""no one in Britain will believe"".Labour, which has already announced plans to increase the top rate of income tax and impose a new ""mansion tax"" on high value properties, insists its plans are fully costed and will not require additional tax hikes if it wins May's general election.Mr Miliband began his final head-to-head encounter with Mr Cameron before the election by joking that the PM had ""announced his retirement plans"" - a reference to a BBC interview in which the prime minister said he would not serve a third term if the Tories remained in power.Challenging Mr Cameron to give a ""straight answer to a straight question"", Mr Miliband pressed him on whether he would rule out a rise in VAT after the election, as Labour had done.In response, the prime minister immediately said ""yes"", prompting loud cheers in turn from the Conservative benches. He contrasted what he said was a ""clear promise"" with Labour's unwillingness to rule out a rise in National Insurance.""I answered a very simple question about VAT. I ruled out an increase... straight answer to him, straight question from me. I have ruled out VAT. Will he rule out national insurance contributions. Yes or no?"" Mr Cameron added: ""We all know this is Labour's job tax. This is their tax of choice. This is what they clobber working people, families and enterprises with.""But Mr Miliband responded by saying there was ""only one person who is going to raise taxes on working families and that is him"".He said nobody would believe Mr Cameron on VAT ""because of his extreme spending plans, because his numbers do not add up and because he promised it last time and broke his promise"".Mr Cameron, he added, had broken other promises made before the last election to reduce annual net migration below 100,000 and not to pursue a major structural re-organisation of the NHS, adding that it was ""time for a better plan and time for a Labour government"".But Mr Cameron suggested a future Labour government would result in the ""chaos of economic crisis"", with Ed Miliband being ""held hostage"" by the SNP.The packed session provided a last opportunity for the two men to rally their MPs and set out their arguments before the start of the election campaign next week.Speaking after the exchanges and the other parties' tax pledges, deputy prime minister Nick Clegg said the Lib Dems ""don't need to raise VAT, national insurance or headline rates of income tax or corporation tax either"".""There are other taxes and other tax loopholes that we can increase or close in order to balance the books,"" he said.

2015-04-09,Met police 'had files on MPs in 90s',https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32044580,"A former undercover police officer has told BBC News that Scotland Yard kept intelligence files on MPs during the 1990s. Ex-Special Branch officer Peter Francis says he saw files on 10 Labour MPs which he and others regularly updated. He says he personally gathered information on three MPs as part of his work infiltrating left-wing groups. The MPs named, and Labour, have called for a forthcoming public inquiry into undercover policing to be widened. Mr Francis operated undercover between 1993 and 1997 in the Met's now disbanded Special Demonstration Squad. He was told to embed himself in left-wing groups or causes that were deemed to pose a potential threat to security. He says that during this period he was told to gather intelligence on MPs and their activities if and when they featured in any of his operations. That information, he says, was added to a special pink file that was available for Special Branch officers to read. Between 1990 and 2001, he claims to have personally seen records relating to Diane Abbott, the late Tony Benn, Jeremy Corbyn, the late Bernie Grant, Peter Hain, Harriet Harman, Ken Livingstone, Joan Ruddock, Dennis Skinner and Jack Straw.Four of the group became ministers during Mr Francis's time in Special Branch - including Jack Straw who was home secretary after 1997. ""When I was deployed undercover in the Special Demonstration Squad, any MP that I came across, such as on demonstrations, I would report back on them,"" he said. Mr Francis says that the files not only contained the MPs' publicly-stated political views - but also intelligence on what was going on behind the scenes in the party or their group. He says some of the information would have been things said in private by the MP, depending on how close each undercover officer had been able to get. Mr Francis said that when he first saw the files he understood that each had probably been created before the individual was an MP because of their personal involvement in radical causes or protests.But he added: ""When they became MPs these files carried on. It [was] your duty as an SDS officer to report back any intelligence that you come across. ""I felt that it was OK to report back on MPs,"" he said. ""I used to give myself a pat on the back, thinking 'I have done a good job'. These MPs were spied on and they should know.""""I don't think the police force should be monitoring MPs, full stop. I don't think we have any right to do that at all. It may be justifiable to say that the Security Service should be doing it - but I certainly don't think the police should be doing it.""Scotland Yard has refused to comment on the substance of the claims, but a spokesman said it had not shied away from serious allegations about the SDS. It said that Operation Herne, the internal police investigation into what happened in the unit, remained an ongoing investigation.""Operation Herne maintains that without speaking to Peter Francis it is simply not possible to fully investigate allegations he makes,"" said a spokesman. ""Operation Herne remains very willing to engage with him.""Mr Francis said that he has refused to speak to Operation Herne because he fears being interviewed under caution as a suspect, rather than a whistleblower. Scotland Yard told the BBC that Operation Herne detectives would be prepared to speak to him as a witness. He has, however, spoken to Mark Ellison QC who reviewed allegations about the SDS for the Home Secretary Theresa May - prompting her to launch a statutory inquiry. He says he will appear before those hearings. Peter Hain, who was a leader of the anti-apartheid movement in the late 1960s and 70s and became an MP in 1991, said he now wants full answers from Scotland Yard. ""I was deeply disturbed to find that files were still being kept by the Special Branch while I and others were serving Members of Parliament,"" he said. ""That is constitutionally an outrage. It infringes the sovereignty of Parliament. ""I want to see the home secretary widen the scope of the inquiry into the SDS to look specifically at the surveillance of MPs and the fact that there were active files on us while we were serving Members of Parliament. ""This should never have happened and it should have been reported and properly authorised - and we don't know whether it was.""Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper echoed the call for the inquiry to be widened in light of what she described as ""extremely serious and disturbing allegations"".""While undercover policing remains a crucial tool in combating serious and organised crime it must not be abused,"" she said.""There have now been a series of serious allegations about undercover policing - ranging from the treatment of Stephen Lawrence's family to police having long-term inappropriate relationships. ""We called some time ago for much stronger oversight of undercover policing and it is also vital to get to the truth about what has happened."" Mrs May announced earlier this month that Lord Justice Pitchford would lead the inquiry into the SDS allegations - but the precise shape of that inquiry is not yet clear.A Home Office spokesman said the review by Mark Ellison QC had unearthed ""serious historical failings"". ""That is why the Home Secretary established a public inquiry to thoroughly investigate undercover policing and the operation of the Special Demonstration Squad. ""Lord Justice Pitchford will consult interested parties to the inquiry over the coming months on setting the terms of reference, with a view to publishing these at the end of July.""Undercover policing is an essential tactic in the fight against crime but to improve the public's confidence in undercover work we must ensure there is no repeat of these failings in the future."""
2015-04-09,NHS problems worst 'since 1990s',https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/health-32057948,"Services in the NHS in England are deteriorating in a way not seen since the early 1990s, according to a leading health think tank. The King's Fund review said waiting times for A&E, cancer care and routine operations had all started getting worse, while deficits were growing.It said such drops in performance had not been seen for 20 years.But the think tank acknowledged the NHS had done as well as could be expected, given the financial climate.Professor John Appleby, chief economist at the King's Fund, which specialises in health care policy, said: ""The next government will inherit a health service that has run out of money and is operating at the very edge of its limits. ""There is now a real risk that patient care will deteriorate as service and financial pressures become overwhelming.""He said in terms of how standards were slipping - not how low they had reached - the situation was the worst it had been since the ""early 1990s"".The report noted much of the deterioration has happened in the second-half of the Parliament with many measures of performance being maintained in the first few years.It said the next government had to address the funding situation, adding the extra £8bn a year NHS England says is needed by 2020, was the ""minimum"" that would be required.The report - a review of performance this Parliament - highlights a range of problems as well as achievements. These include:The report is the second part of the King's Fund pre-election review of the NHS this Parliament.Last month it warned the coalition government's reforms of the health service had been ""damaging and distracting"".The King's Fund report should make worrying reading. The reference to the 1990s conjures up images of - for the NHS at least - a bygone era. The think tank's point was not that waiting times had reached the level they were at then, rather that this is the first time in two decades of almost continuous improvement that there has been a sustained drop in performance.In many ways, that had to happen. Services cannot keep getting better for ever. Nonetheless, the findings are crystal clear: the NHS is at a critical juncture. But what is less easy to determine is to what extent the coalition's policies have contributed to the difficulties.The think tank has already provided a critical analysis of the government's reforms - and when pushed, acknowledged the health service may have been ""in better shape"" if they had not happened.But the more significant issue for the health of the health service this Parliament has been the squeeze on finances. Even though the budget has been increased, it has felt more like a cut to many because demands have risen so quickly.On this though, the King's Fund accepted that the government's hands were tied. Given the state of the economy, ministers did as much as they could have.Read more from NickRoyal College of Nursing general secretary Peter Carter said politicians needed to take note of the warnings made by the King's Fund.""Morale is low, and more and more staff are being made sick with stress because of the intolerable pressure they are under,"" he added. Katherine Murphy, of the Patients Association, said: ""The findings echo what we are hearing on a daily basis on our helpline. It is clear to the public that the future of the NHS is one of the most important issues facing the nation and it should be a central issue in the election campaign.""Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham said: ""Five years ago David Cameron stood on a promise to protect the NHS. This report provides authoritative proof that he has broken that promise.""But a Department of Health spokesman said: ""As the King's Fund says, the NHS has 'performed well in the face of huge challenges', but if we are to continue to invest in the NHS going forward it needs to be backed by a strong economy.""

2015-04-09,SNP 'could block Tory government',https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32045419,"The SNP would block a minority Conservative government by voting down its Queen's Speech if it holds the post-election balance of power, its former leader Alex Salmond has said.Mr Salmond said the move could bring down the government if Labour joined in, with David Cameron ""locked out"".The Conservatives accused him of ""trying to sabotage the democratic will of the British people"".Labour has called his balance of power prediction ""bluster and bluff"".In recent days Mr Salmond, who is bidding to become a Westminster MP at the 7 May general election, has claimed his party could ""hold the power"" in a hung Parliament and would be able to influence the Budget of a minority Labour government.This was dismissed by Labour leader Ed Miliband, who has ruled out a formal coalition with the Scottish nationalists.The SNP currently has six MPs at Westminster, but recent opinion polls suggest its share could increase dramatically at the general election.James Cook, BBC News Scotland correspondentIf the Conservatives attempt to form a minority government and enough MPs vote against their Queen's Speech the administration would fall at the first hurdle and the leader of the opposition would have a shot at forming a government.That's how parliamentary democracy works in the event of a hung Parliament.And yet the Conservatives are saying that by planning to vote against a government he opposes Alex Salmond has ""confirmed he would sabotage the democratic will of the British people in order to make Ed Miliband prime minister"".It is part of their continuing attempt to portray Mr Miliband as a weak leader whose strings are being pulled by Mr Salmond.This kind of language causes despair among Tories north of the border who fear that the party in London is waltzing into an SNP trap.They know that many voters in Scotland will read the phrase ""democratic will of the British people"" and hear ""democratic will of the English people"".Because, if it is illegitimate for Scottish MPs, from whatever party, to vote against one government and support another in the British parliament, then what, voters may ask, is the point of the union?Who is dancing to Mr Salmond's tune now?Mr Salmond, the former Scottish first minister, told the New Statesman that in the event of a hung Parliament, a minority Conservative government would have to ""go straight effectively for a vote of confidence - usually the Queen's Speech, although it could be otherwise, of course - and we'd be voting against.""If David Cameron lost this vote, he said, there would be a two-week period for another government to be formed.BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said Mr Salmond had ""hardened his anti-Conservative rhetoric"" in the interview.A Conservative spokesman said:  ""Alex Salmond has confirmed he would sabotage the democratic will of the British people in order to make Ed Miliband prime minister. ""That would mean chaos for Britain, with weak Ed Miliband dancing to Alex Salmond's tune.""He said the ""only way to keep Britain together"" was to vote Conservative.Mr Salmond's latest comments come after Mr Miliband said the only people writing a future Labour Budget would be himself and shadow chancellor Ed Balls.Speaking in Clydebank on Monday, he added: ""It's not going to be Alex Salmond - not in a million years."""
2015-04-09,MPs criticise 'lack of EU debate',https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32045290,"The government's ""failure"" to let MPs debate EU legislation is ""deplorable"", a Parliamentary committee says.The European Scrutiny Committee said ministers had refused to schedule debates on issues such as free movement and the EU's Budget.It also said BBC coverage of EU matters should be ""improved substantially"".The government said the number of EU debates had doubled since 2009-10, while the BBC said its coverage was ""extensive and impartial"".The cross-party committee's role includes scrutinising EU documents and recommending the most important for debate in the House of Commons.Its report said in the period covering most of the 2014-15 financial year there were three debates on the floor of the House, compared with 12 in 2013-14.It also pointed out that not a single debate had taken place during a nine-month period, between 9 June 2014 and 9 March 2015.""The government's collective failure to schedule so many debates on EU documents over the past year is deplorable, and is a discourtesy to this committee and to all members of the House,"" the MPs said.Prime Minister David Cameron has sought to rally support from other EU leaders for his plans to curb welfare payments to European migrants ahead of a referendum on the UK's membership if he wins the general election.The committee said the government's ""cavalier"" approach was ""at odds with UK ministers' claims in their speeches across the EU about the role of national parliaments"".The Foreign Office said the government was committed to a ""strong EU scrutiny system that enables Parliament to hold it to account for the decisions taken in Brussels"".It added: ""We have made good on our commitment to raise standards by doubling the number of Europe debates on the floor of the House since 2009-10.""This government has also increased by around a fifth since 2010 the number of EU proposals that have been scrutinised and cleared by Parliament before being agreed in Brussels.""The committee has also been examining the BBC's coverage of European issues, taking evidence from director general Lord Hall and head of news James Harding earlier this month.During that appearance, Lord Hall said the desire for balanced output ""ran deep"" within the BBC and he believed that this was being achieved.Mr Harding said if the public was going to trust the BBC to report on politicians impartially it had to be clear that BBC journalists weren't ""asked by politicians to come and account for what they do and in effect do the bidding of those politicians"".But the committee said it was ""concerned about the manner in which the BBC treats EU issues"", calling for coverage to be ""improved substantially"".It suggested coverage did not reflect all sides of the debate on the European Union, and more analysis was needed. Its chairman, Conservative MP Sir William Cash, said the BBC had ""very particular obligations"" to be impartial and to ""educate and inform"".He added:  ""We do not believe this is currently being achieved in the context of the BBC's EU coverage.""A BBC spokesman said the corporation provided extensive and impartial coverage of European and Parliamentary issues, and it would be a breach of the corporation's independence if a committee of MPs instructed the BBC on its coverage."
2015-04-09,Lobbyists must 'conform' with rules,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32047992,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe woman in charge of the government's new register of lobbyists has said she expects the industry to ""conform"" with the statutory system. Speaking ahead of the register's launch, Alison White conceded a lot of lobbyists would not be listed on it.But she said her job was to make sure the rules were implemented and she would do so with ""extreme verve and vigour.""But one critic of the register said it was ""fake"" and full of ""loopholes"".Lobbyists are companies or individuals paid to influence government decisions.The coalition promised to introduce a statutory register of lobbyists when it came to power in 2010, and legislation was passed last year, with ministers saying the move would help clean up politics.However, the new register will only cover consultant lobbyists and will not apply to lobbyists working ""in-house"" for companies or organisations.A person or company will only need to be registered if they are contacting a government minister or permanent secretary in a government department - leading to criticism it will not come close to reflecting the scale or nature of lobbying that goes on across Whitehall.But Ms White, who is independent of the government, said her task was to implement the law as it stood not to question the powers she had been given. ""We are having something that has never been in place before,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""This is a statutory register. The industry tells me it is a professional industry. I expect them to conform with the legislation. It is my job to make sure they do so.""Ms White, who was appointed as the registrar of consultant lobbyists in September, acknowledged the register would not indicate different ""levels of lobbying"".""The legislation was quite narrowly drafted to address a particular issue, which was that it was not always particularly clear, when ministers were being lobbied, who the client of the lobbyist was. That is what the register was set up to do,"" she said.She added: ""This will give anyone who wishes to access the register the opportunity to be able to see who is lobbying and being paid for it and who their clients are. That is the main information the register will contain.""If a lobbyist sets out to influence government policy in some way, they would have to be registered. If they are not registered, then they would not be conforming. They have to go on the register before they lobby.""Ms White said last month that the register would not have any entries on its launch day but she had received more than ""20 expressions of interest"" about joining and companies and individuals might be required to sign up retrospectively.Potential registrants will be able to log on and create an account to file an ""information return"".But Tamasin Cave, from the Alliance for Lobbying Transparency coalition, said ""hardly anyone"" in the industry would be covered by the provisions of the new law. ""You have a huge commercial lobbying industry, and very few of them will have to sign up,"" she told Today.""The second flaw is that it won't show the interaction between lobbyists and government, and that is what a register is for.""It is to show the activity - who is discussing what with whom, but this shows nothing of this interaction. It is a fake register."""
2015-04-09,Car smoking ban MSP welcomes backing,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-south-scotland-32055226,"The Liberal Democrat MSP behind a bill to ban smoking in cars when children are present has welcomed the support of the Scottish government.South of Scotland MSP Jim Hume launched the members' bill in December.The government said it was ""very supportive"" of the principles of the bill, but changes could be needed to make it ""workable"".Motorists could potentially be fined £100 for breaching the rule if it becomes law.Mr Hume lodged draft proposals for a bill last May calling for a ban in Scotland on smoking in private vehicles when children under 18 were present.He said he was ""over the moon"" at the news the Scottish government would endorse the Smoking Prohibition (Children in Motor Vehicles) (Scotland) Bill.He said: ""With cross-party support and the support of many third sector organisations, there is every chance that this could be in place in the next year.""Eighty-four per cent of the 160 responses to my consultation were positive and people from across Scotland have expressed their support for the move.""The bill is about guaranteeing that children in Scotland can have the freedom to go on and lead healthy lives if they choose to.""I look forward to working with MSPs from all parties as the bill progresses.""Public Health Minister Maureen Watt said the Scottish government had considered including the measure in its Public Health Bill, but instead decided to support Mr Hume's proposals.She said: ""As with any bill, as it goes through the scrutiny process, there may be amendments and improvements to strengthen the legislation and ensure it is fit for purpose. ""But we believe that the underpinning principles are strong, and that is why I am pleased to support it.""Scottish Labour and a wide range of health organisations have backed his proposals.But the Scottish Conservatives have reservations about how the bill would work in practice.The party's health spokesman Jackson Carlaw said: ""While Scottish Conservatives support any moves which would protect young people from hazardous second hand smoke we have concerns as to how this would be enforced.""It would be a better use of resources to conduct a public awareness campaign similar to that which is being proposed by the government in Wales.""We will be watching this campaign in order to ascertain what lessons may be learned and what approaches may be adopted in Scotland.""Anti-smoking campaigners welcomed the Scottish government's backing for Mr Hume's bill.ASH Scotland's chief executive Sheila Duffy said: ""It is another public health initiative that can help Scotland move forward with its ambition to achieve a tobacco-free generation in 20 years' time.""It is popular with the public and will bring Scotland into line with upcoming legislation in England and Wales.""We believe it can be effectively enforced and that having the legislation focus on cars with children bypasses concerns over interference in people's private lives.""Jim Hume must be congratulated for taking the initiative on this proposal and for all the hard work he and his team have done to bring this important measure forward.""But Simon Clark, director of the smokers' group Forest, said the bill was ""legislation for legislation's sake"".He said: ""Smoking in cars carrying children is inconsiderate. The overwhelming majority of smokers know that and don't do it.""The very small number that do will carry on regardless because the law will be difficult, if not impossible, to enforce.""Education has to be better than legislation but the government prefers gesture politics and the big stick."""
2015-04-09,Candidate quits over UKIP MEP remark,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32038485,"A UKIP election candidate has quit the party over comments made by the party's only Scottish MEP about a Scottish government minister.Tim Wilson has decided not to stand in South Northamptonshire after David Coburn MEP compared Humza Yousaf to convicted terrorist Abu Hamza.Mr Coburn has apologised for the remarks, saying it was a ""joke"".A spokesman for UKIP said Mr Wilson had failed to emphasise local issues in his general election campaign.UKIP leader Nigel Farage said Mr Coburn's remarks were a ""joke in poor taste"" but he would not be taking any action against him.But Mr Wilson said he was disillusioned with the party over the ""racist jibes"" and has decided to stand down.He told BBC Scotland he was appalled by Mr Coburn's comments about Mr Yousaf and frustrated by the inaction of the party's leadership on the issue.  He said David Coburn had produced ""what I can only describe as an Islamaphobic insult, and that's simply not acceptable"".  Mr Wilson added: ""Of course he went on and apologised.  I think, frankly, that if you are in a position of power you have to be able to control what ideas emerge from your head and how they get to your mouth and, in fact, you shouldn't have those ideas in the first place.  ""But the real issue is that when Mr Farage was asked what he thought about this he dismissed this as a joke.  ""I don't think this is a joke. I think this is something very serious.  It may not be that this man intended to cause offence but we aren't interested in what his intentions are.  We are interested in the effect what he says has on other people and the effect is catastrophic, it's appalling and I've resigned.""In his resignation letter, Mr Wilson said he had been ""systematically gagged by the party whip"" and forbidden to speak about Islam favourably. A spokesman for UKIP said Mr Wilson had failed to put more emphasis on local issues in his campaign.He said: ""Whilst we had initially been optimistic about Tim Wilson's abilities as a candidate, it became obvious in recent weeks that he was out of his depth in representing our party in the way we would expect. ""Mr Wilson had clearly misunderstood the expectations that UKIP place on all of its candidates. Principal amongst those is focusing on issues that are relevant to local voters. UKIP put huge emphasis on local issues and Mr Wilson was unwilling to follow UKIP guidelines in this respect.""Last week MSPs at the Scottish Parliament unanimously condemned the remarks made by Mr Coburn during a newspaper interview.MSPs were debating a motion celebrating Scotland's diverse communities.The president of the European Parliament, Martin Schulz, condemned the remarks, saying they were ""not worthy of any elected member"". But a spokesman for the president said he could not act on remarks made outside parliament.The move comes just days after another candidate, Jonathan Stanley, quit in protest at the ""racist filth"" in UKIP. Mr Stanley, who was due to stand in the Cumbrian seat of Westmorland and Lonsdale, was the party's former head of policy in Scotland."

2015-04-09,Manifesto watch,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-29642613,"Political parties are putting together their manifestos for May's general election. Here's a guide to where they currently stand on the issues voters say they care about most (according to pollsters IPSOS Mori).ImmigrationConservatives:  David Cameron wants to make migrants wait four years before they can claim certain benefits, such as tax credits, Universal Credit, or get access to social housing. He wants to stop migrants from claiming child benefit for dependents living outside the UK, and remove those that have failed to find work after six months. Mr Cameron has promised to put reform of EU free movement rules at the heart of his renegotiation of Britain's relationship with the EU. He has ruled out a temporary cap on migrant numbers or an ""emergency brake"" on EU freedom of movement rules - ideas both mooted in recent months, saying this would be less ""effective"" than reducing the incentives for people to come to the UK. The party has a continuing goal to bring net immigration down to below 100,000 people a year (it currently stands at 243,000).Labour: ""Stronger"" border controls to tackle illegal immigration with ""proper"" entry and exit checks. ""Smarter"" targets to reduce low-skilled migration but ensure university students and high-skilled workers are not deterred. Employment agencies who only recruit abroad will be outlawed while the fines for employing illegal immigrants will be increased.Lib Dems: Reintroduce exit checks at borders, so the government can identify people who are overstaying their visa. Will require all new claimants for Jobseekers Allowance to have their English language skills assessed, with JSA then being conditional on attending language courses for those whose English is poor. Ensure that EU migrants have to ""earn"" their entitlement to benefits.SNP: Allow the devolved government to have control over immigration to Scotland, and introduce a Canadian-style earned citizenship system to attract highly-skilled immigrants.Plaid Cymru: Oppose a points-based system. Support the right of asylum seekers to work in Wales while they wait for status decisions to be made. Lobby the Westminster government to ensure that they shut ""detention"" centres.UKIP: Introduce an Australian-style points policy, used to select migrants with the skills and attributes needed to work in the country - covering people from inside and outside the EU. Bring net immigration down to 50,000 people a year. Priority lanes for UK passport holders. Increase UK border staff by 2,500. Tougher English language tests for migrants seeking permanent residence. Opt out of the Dublin treaty to allow the UK to return asylum seekers to other EU countries without considering their claim. Anyone who currently has the legal right to live, work, or study in the UK would not face deportation in the event of the country's withdrawal from the EU.Greens:  Progressively reduce UK immigration controls. Migrants illegally in the UK for over five years will be allowed to remain unless they pose a serious danger to public safety. More legal rights for asylum seekers.Taxes and the economyConservatives: Eradicate the deficit by 2018 and secure an overall budget surplus by 2019-20. Achieve this by spending cuts, not tax rises, while raising NHS spending. An income tax cut for 30 million people by 2020. Tax would start to kick in at £12,500 a year, instead of £10,500. This will cost £5.6bn. The higher tax rate, 40%, would start at £50,000 instead of £41,900, again by 2020, at a cost of £1.6bn. This will be paid for through £25bn in additional spending cuts and economic growth. No increases in VAT.Labour: Get the current budget into surplus and the national debt falling ""as soon as possible in the next parliament"". No additional borrowing for new spending. Reintroduce the 50p top rate of income tax for earnings over £150,000.  Cut income tax for 24 million people by bringing back the 10p rate, paid for by scrapping the Married Couples' Tax Allowance. Bring in a ""mansion tax"" on properties worth over £2m, to raise £1.2bn. A tax on bankers' bonuses. A 5% pay cut for every government minister. Push for UK overseas territories to be put on an international blacklist if they refuse to co-operate with a drive against tax avoidance. No increases in VAT or National Insurance contributions.Lib Dems: Raise the personal allowance - the point at which you start paying income tax - to £11,000 in April 2016 and then to £12,500 by 2020. ""Strict new fiscal rules"" to ensure the deficit has gone by April 2018, with the wealthy contributing the most. The Lib Dems invented the ""mansion tax"" but in contrast to Labour have set out how it would operate - along similar lines to council tax bands. There are also Lib Dem plans to increase capital gains tax - paid on profits from second homes or shares - from 28% to 35%. Impose an additional 8% rate of corporation tax on UK banks to raise an extra £1bn a year to help pay off the deficit.SNP: Oppose UK plans in the Infrastructure Bill which will allow oil and gas drilling and hydraulic fracturing beneath people's homes without consent. Invest in offshore wind farming. Support an international bank tax and limits to industry bonuses.Plaid Cymru: Build a Green Skills Construction College, specialising in green energy. Establish a publicly-owned energy company. Establish a publicly-owned Bank of Wales business investment bank. Enforce a living wage. Give devolved nations an equal say in institutions that affect everyone's lives, such as the Bank of England.UKIP: Increase the personal allowance to the level of full-time minimum wage earnings, about £13,500, by 2020. Abolish inheritance tax. Introduce a 35% income tax rate between £42,285 and £55,000, at which point the 40% rate becomes payable. Set up a Treasury Commission to design a turnover tax on large businesses. Cut foreign aid budget by £9bn a year. Scrap HS2. Save £8bn a year in membership fees by leaving the EU.  Lower the VAT rate charged on restorations to listed buildings.Greens: People earning more than £100,000 a year would pay 50% income tax. Wealth tax of 1% to 2% on people worth £3m or more. Renationalise the railways and energy companies. Scrap HS2. Allow councils to impose extra business rates on out-of-town supermarkets to fund small local businesses. Crackdown on tax avoidance by multinationals. Allow ""the current dependence on economic growth to cease, and allow zero or negative growth to be feasible without individual hardship"". Commit Britain to a ""zero carbon"" future. Cut rail and bus fares by an average of 10%. Enforce a cap on bankers' bonuses.The NHSConservatives:  Chancellor George Osborne says he will put an extra £2bn into frontline health services across the UK, which he described as a ""down payment"" on a plan drawn up by NHS bosses calling for an extra £8bn a year above inflation by 2020. In England, everyone would be able to see a GP seven days a week by 2020. Recruit 5,000 more doctors.Labour:  Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said Labour would commit an extra £2.5bn a year above Mr Osborne's plan. The money will come from three sources - a new ""mansion"" tax, clamping down on tax avoidance by big corporations and a new tax on tobacco companies. Patients in England would get a GP appointment within 48 hours and would not have to wait longer than a week for cancer tests and results. Scrap the Health and Social Care Act and end ""creeping privatisation"" of the NHS.  Integrate health and social care services into a system of ""whole-person care"". Give greater priority to mental health services. Replace the Cancer Drugs Fund in England when it runs out in 2016 with a £330m fund to improve access to innovative cancer drugs, surgery and radiotherapy. Recruit 5,000 more healthcare workers to help patients stay in their homes and introduce new safety checks to identify people at risk of hospitalisation. Prioritise child mental health by increasing the proportion of the mental health budget spent on children.Lib Dems: An extra £1bn for the NHS every year, to be funded by - amongst other things - making higher earners pay more tax on their shares. Half of this will go towards mental health. Ensure that spending on the NHS rises in line with growth in the economy. People who need therapy for conditions such as depression will be guaranteed treatment within 18 weeks. For young patients experiencing psychosis for the first time treatment will be provided within two weeks of being referred by a GP. This is all going to happen from April, with more mental health targets to follow if the Lib Dems return to government. Wants a cross-party review of the future of NHS funding.SNP: Reduce the number of senior managers in the NHS by 25% over the next parliament. Streamline the work of health boards. Real terms increases in year-on-year NHS spending.Plaid Cymru: Recruit 1,000 extra doctors to the Welsh NHS over two terms of a Plaid government. Offer financial incentives for recruiting doctors to areas and specialisms where there are, or are predicted to be, shortages. Encourage innovation and attract more research funding, in part by increasing research and development funding as government finance allows. Improve training for postgraduate doctors and stop them being used to ""plug gaps"" in staff rotas. More recruitment from within the EU to fill vacancies and using international doctors to staff the NHS while a new generation of Welsh doctors are trained.UKIP: An extra £3bn per year in NHS funding paid for by quitting the EU and through ""middle management"" cuts. Keep NHS free at the point of delivery. Stop any further use of PFI, and encourage local authorities to buy out their PFI contracts early where it is affordable to do so. Ensure all visitors and migrants who have been here for fewer than five years have NHS-approved medical insurance as a condition of entry to UK, with £200m of the £2bn saved to be spent on ending hospital parking charges in England. Bring back state-enrolled nurses and return powers to matrons. Monitor and Care Quality Commission to be replaced with elected county health boards. Stop spending £90m a year on gastric band and breast enhancement operations.Greens: Funding to be diverted away from centralised facilities towards community healthcare, illness prevention and health promotion.  Stop privatisation. Abolish prescription charges. Dedicated NHS Tax to go direct to the health service. Ban proactive recruitment of non-British NHS staff from overseas. A complete ban on the promotion of tobacco and alcohol products, including sponsorship.Security, defence and foreign affairsConservatives: Hold a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU by 2017, after negotiating the return of some powers from Brussels. Protect foreign aid budget. Replace Trident.Labour:  Push for reform of European Union and prevent Britain from ""sleepwalking"" towards exit. Commit in law to holding a Strategic Defence and Security Review every 5 years. Outlaw discrimination and abuse of Armed Forces personnel.Lib Dems: Campaign to reduce the number of Trident nuclear submarines. Push for greater European Union efficiency. SNP: Oppose nuclear weapons and push for removal of Trident submarines from Scotland. In 2010, proposed a Scottish Centre for Reconciliation and Conflict Resolution, to promote peaceful alternatives to armed conflict. Maintain 0.7% commitment to foreign aid. Enhanced role for Scotland within the UK in Europe, particularly in fisheries policy.Plaid Cymru: Honour commitment of 0.7% of budget used for foreign aid. Campaign for cancellation of developing countries' debts. Support the Fair Trade movement. Support the 'Tobin' or 'Robin hood' tax as a means of encouraging more responsibility and stability in the global markets. Reform the IMF and World Bank in order to improve regulation and accountability. Continue membership of the EU, but campaign for democratic reform. Support minority nations and minority language speakers around the world. Pass a Military Wellbeing Act to promote and safeguard the physical and mental health and wellbeing of military personnel.UKIP:  Leave the European Union. Remove the passports of any person who has gone to fight for a terrorist organisation and deport anyone who has committed a terrorist act. Cut foreign aid budget by £9bn. Create a Veterans Department to look after the interests of ex-service men and women.Greens: Referendum on Britain's EU membership. Want reform of EU to hand powers back to local communities. Boost overseas aid to 1% of GDP within 10 years. Scrap Britain's nuclear weapons. Take the UK out of NATO unilaterally. End the so-called ""special relationship"" between the UK and the US.  Stop EU-US free trade deal TTIP. JobsConservatives: Create three million apprenticeships to be paid for by benefit cuts.Labour: Guarantee a job for under 25s unemployed for over a year and adults unemployed for more than two years. As many young people to go on an apprenticeship as currently go to university by 2025. Create a million new high technology, green jobs by 2025. Ban ""exploitative"" zero hour contracts.Lib Dems: An extra £1 an hour for the lowest paid apprentices. Campaign to create a million more jobs.SNP: Introduce gender quotas on public boards. Living wage ""a central priority"" in all Scottish government contracts. Continue the 'small business bonus'.Plaid Cymru: Provide rates relief for small businesses. Increase the number and value of contracts from Welsh public bodies that go to firms within Wales.UKIP: Allow firms to offer jobs to British workers first ""without the fear of being sued for discrimination"".Greens: A national energy conservation scheme to create thousands of new jobs. The party wants to create ""sustainable jobs"" and promotes more local production of food and goods.Education Conservatives: Protect England's schools budget - from reception entry at age four or five to the end of GCSEs at 16 - in cash terms although funding per pupil will not keep pace with inflation. Pre-school and post 16 education not ring fenced. Convert up to 3,500 more schools judged by Ofsted to ""require improvement"" into academies. ""War on illiteracy and innumeracy"". State primary schools in England that repeatedly failed to have a proportion of year-six pupil pass times tables and writing tests be forced to become academies, or have sponsorship replaced if already an academy. Opposed to giving votes to 16 and 17-year-olds for UK-wide general elections and local elections in England.Labour:  Increase the overall education budget in England, including schools, nurseries, Sure Start and provision for 16-to 18-year-olds, by at least the rate of inflation, although per-pupil funding is not specifically protected, meaning some of the increase will be eaten up by rising pupil numbers. Parents of primary school children would be guaranteed childcare from 8am to 6pm. The amount of free childcare for three and four year olds would be increased from 15 to 25 hours a week. Compulsory sex and relationship education in all schools. Refuse to grant business rate relief to independent schools unless they can show a ""meaningful impact"" on state schools through a new School Partnership Standard, for example by lending teaching staff or assisting in university admissions procedures. Committed to extending the franchise to 16 and 17-year-olds in elections across the UK. Double the number of Sure Start childcare places to more than 118,000. Tighten up the rules on primary school class sizes to ensure they do not have more than 30 pupils.Lib Dems: Protect the education budget from cuts. Guarantee qualified teachers and a core curriculum set by independent experts, as well as compulsory sex education, in all state schools including academies and free schools. More money for disadvantaged school children and free childcare for all two year olds. A two-thirds discount on all local bus fares for young people aged 16-21. Supports lowering the voting age to 16 in all UK elections.SNP: Guaranteed free 30 hours of childcare a week for three and four-year-olds in Scotland, up from 16 hours. Maintain lack of tuition fees at Scottish universities, and offer financial support in grants and loans to students. Continue to build and refurbish schools. Lower voting age to 16 in all UK elections.Plaid Cymru: Introduce a compulsory modern foreign language GCSE in secondary schools and the teaching of modern foreign languages in primary schools. Look at ways to strengthen the teaching of Welsh history and culture. Oppose foundation schools, academies and free schools. Look at moving from a per-pupil funding mechanism to a funding model based on the catchment area. Will not support any further increases in tuition fees for higher education students, and will seek the abolition of tuition fees as and when public finances allow. Supports lowering the voting age to 16 for elections to the Welsh Assembly and the UK Parliament.UKIP: More grammar schools. Scrap sex education for children aged under seven. Scrap tuition fees for students from poorer backgrounds who take degree courses in the sciences, technology, maths or engineering. Greater emphasis on vocational education with new Apprenticeship Qualification Option. School governing boards must be made up of at least 30% parents of children at the school. Allow universities to charge same amount for EU students as non-EU students.Greens: End performance related pay for teachers. Replace Ofsted with an independent National Council for Educational Excellence. Bring Free Schools and Academies into local authority control.

Withdraw Jobseeker's Allowance from young people after six months unless they take part in ""community projects"". And 18 to 21-year-olds wouldn't be entitled to housing benefit. Ban on zero-hours contracts which stop people getting work elsewhere. Raise the personal allowance - the point at which you start paying income tax - to £11,000 in April 2016 and then to £12,500 by 2020, which means that if you work on minimum wage for 30 hours you will pay no income tax. Young people out of work, education or training for six months will have to do unpaid community work to get benefits. This will apply to about 50,000 18 to 21-year-olds. Universal benefits for pensioners, such as free bus passes, TV licences for the over 75s and the winter fuel allowance. will once again be protected. Labour: Freeze energy prices until 2017. Increase in the minimum wage from £6.50-an-hour to £8-an-hour by 2020. Rises in child benefit capped at 1% for the first two years of the next parliament. Winter fuel allowance would be withdrawn from the wealthiest pensioners. Repeal what the government calls the spare room subsidy, dubbed the ""bedroom tax"" by Labour.  A million interest-free loans to help people insulate their homes. Rail fares would be capped. Double the amount of paid paternity leave available to new fathers from two to four weeks, and increase statutory paternity pay to £260 a week.Lib Dems: Raise the personal allowance - the point at which you start paying income tax - to £11,000 in April 2016 and then to £12,500 by 2020 (the Conservatives are promising the same thing). Nick Clegg has said he would not accept Conservative plans to freeze working-age benefits without taxing the rich too. He hasn't said he would block welfare cuts altogether. Withdraw eligibility for the Winter Fuel Payment and free TV Licence from pensioners on the 40% rate of income tax. A ""yellow card"" system to deal with benefit claimants breaking the rules, rather than imposing sanctions without warning.SNP: Oppose cuts to in-work benefits. Support moves to extend paternity leave. Introduce a maximum combined withdrawal rate for benefits and reforms to employment support allowance and cold weather payments. Protect policies such as concessionary travel for older Scots.Plaid Cymru: Move away from complex and expensive means testing for child-related benefits. Continue to campaign for the introduction of a living pension during the period of the next parliament for those aged 80 and over. UKIP: Only pay child benefit for the first two children for new claimants. Increase the Carers' Allowance to the same level as Jobseekers' Allowance (JSA) and pay a higher rate of JSA if you've been in work and already made tax and National Insurance contributions. Prevent anyone taking up permanent residence in Britain unless they're able to support themselves and any dependents they bring with them for at least five years and stop them receiving benefits. Stop paying child benefit for children who don't live in Britain. Scrap what UKIP calls the ""detested bedroom tax"". Boost ""credit unions"".Greens: The party backs a Citizen's Income, a fixed amount of £72 income a week to be paid to every individual, whether they are in work or not, to be funded by higher taxes on the better off and green levies.  But in the short-term it would increase the minimum wage to £10 by 2020. Ban zero hours contracts. Axe the ""bedroom tax"". Abolish the work capability assessment and restore the level of the former disability living allowance. Scrap the government's welfare cap, which limits the maximum amount a household can claim annually to £26,000 a year."

2015-04-09,Elephant trap?,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32047998,"The campaign has not even got under way, yet in the space of a couple of hours we have now been treated to not only one election pledge, but to two. The prime minister ruled out raising VAT if re-elected - while Labour said National Insurance contributions wouldn't go up.Usually politicians fudge the question of tax rises.  When he was leader of the opposition David Cameron himself said ""we have no need to raise taxes"" - before hiking up VAT after polling day.Famously, John Major said he had ""no plans"" to put up the sales tax -  before his chancellor did just that.And when he appeared in front of the cross-party Treasury committee of MPs on Tuesday, the current chancellor seemed to be continuing that tradition.  Under repeated questioning, George Osborne said: ""The policies we have do not involve a VAT rise.""That formulation appeared to give him not so much wriggle room, but an entire wriggle mansion.Labour assumed their campaign warning of further VAT rises to come under the Tories was very much on the money.But George Osborne's allies are suggesting privately that he had, in fact, been walking Ed Miliband to the edge of an elephant trap, then beckoning the prime minister to push the opposition leader in.Ed Miliband's strategists fully expected Mr Cameron to repeat the chancellor's obfuscation on tax at the final Prime Minister's Questions of this Parliament. They would then have expanded on the theme, inviting the prime minister to answer other difficult questions - then say he wasn't being straight with the British people for avoiding them.But the Labour leader was completely wrong-footed when first the prime minister said he would rule out a VAT rise and then counter-punched, inquiring if Labour would now rule out an increase in National Insurance contributions.Ed Miliband dodged the question and what could have been downbeat Conservative benches, uneasy over the prime minister's announcement this week of his retirement plans, were given something to cheer.The reason Ed Miliband didn't respond is because he was holding the National Insurance pledge back for Labour's manifesto.But that soon became unsustainable - so the other Ed, the shadow chancellor Ed Balls, had to undertake a hasty round of the TV studios to do just that.When I spoke to him mid-tour, he put on a brave face. His view was that George Osborne, having raised VAT from 17.5% to 20%, wanted to give the issue a low profile - whereas the prime minister had now made the mistake of putting it centre stage. And he believed David Cameron's promise would be judged against his past VAT-raising performance.He defended Ed Miliband's reluctance to talk about National Insurance as he felt it would have been ""inappropriate"" to announce Labour tax policy at PMQs.So the prime minister - always a better tactician than strategist - can at least satisfy himself that he smoked Labour out on NI and disrupted at least one entry in their election campaign grid.But the exchange actually raised more questions than it answered.If the main parties are ruling out further potential sources of revenue, but still committing themselves to eradicating a £90bn black hole in the public finances, will they now be under more pressure during the election campaign to spell out in much greater detail exactly what they intend to cut?"
2015-04-09,Who's next?,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32031343,"David Cameron's declaration that he will not seek a third term in office if he retains power in May has immediately stoked interest in who might fill his shoes when he's gone. Here are the likely - and perhaps less obvious - possibilities.Claim? As chancellor of the exchequer he's the man in charge of the purse strings and master strategist - and reportedly the PM's favourite to succeed him, although he hasn't said as much. Mr Cameron's right-hand man has had an image makeover of late, with a new haircut and a diet to shed some pounds. And he has seemingly recovered from his ""omnishambles"" Budget in 2012, with his latest - and last Budget - of the parliament giving the Tories a lead in some polls. He's said to be well liked among Conservative cabinet ministers and backbench MPs, whose support is vital for any candidate wanting to take on the party leadership. He shas some work to do among grassroots Tory members, however, coming fifth in ConservativeHome's latest online poll of party members on future leaders.Latest odds: 10/1 (according to William Hill)What's he said? ""The prime minister leads a strong team but what you see from him is answering a direct question with a direct answer. I think that's really refreshing. He says he's going to serve that full five years so the real question facing the country now is do you want the strong leadership of David Cameron that's delivering zero inflation and record jobs or do you want the chaos and incompetence of Ed Miliband.""Claim? The longest-serving home secretary in 50 years, she is only the second Conservative woman to secure one of the top four jobs in government. In her role, she has talked tough on immigration and crime and taken on the Police Federation. And she is popular with Tory activists, consistently occupying either first or second place in ConservativeHome's online polls on future party leaders. There have long been claims of Mrs May positioning herself for the top job, with reported tensions between her and the prime minister. Critics say she lacks charisma and micro-manages - while some cannot forget her coining the now infamous ""nasty party"" phrase at a Tory conference in 2002, but supporters say she is a formidable operator, and have dubbed her Britain's Angela Merkel. Latest odds: 9/2What's she said? ""My view is very simple, David Cameron is a first class leader of the party and a first class prime minister and I hope he is going to be doing that for a very long time."" (Desert Island discs, 23 November 2014)Claim? The blonde bombshell and mayor of London who can seemingly reach voters that others in the party cannot. Casting aside a rather chequered past he steered the capital through the 2012 Olympics, launched the successful and popular ""Boris bikes"" and got rid of London's ""bendy buses"" in favour of the new Routemaster double deckers. Mr Johnson hopes to revive his Westminster parliamentary career at the general election. He has been tipped by many to take the helm of the Conservative Party, and has not discouraged the idea. Like Theresa May, he is also a favourite among the grassroots of the party, pipping her to the top spot in ConservativeHome's latest poll of party members on future leaders. (he's ahead by 2 points). Critics say the gaffe-prone politician is not the right man for the job, but his supporters point to his wide-spread appeal.Latest odds: 9/4What's he said? ""I think what David Cameron is saying is banal and obvious. There has already been a leader of the Conservative Party for ten years and he's done an outstanding job. What he's saying now is that he wants to serve through to 2020 and that is frankly what we need him to do... five more years is what this country needs. I'm not entirely certain I see what the story is. He was asked a straight question, are you going to serve a third term like Mrs Thatcher or Tony Blair and he said no, because he thinks that ten years on top of British politics is an incredibly long time.""Claim? A self-made millionaire and devotee of Margaret Thatcher, he is regarded as one of the Conservatives' fastest-rising stars. The Treasury minister-turned-culture secretary became the first of the 2010 intake of MPs to reach cabinet level, and the first Asian male Conservative cabinet minister. He's currently polling well among the Conservative grassroots, who voted him third most preferable leader in ConservativeHome's latest online future leader poll. David Cameron recently said he wants to see a British Asian prime minister in his lifetime.Latest odds: 12/1Claim? Currently holding one of the four great offices of state - foreign secretary - Mr Hammond's name has often cropped up whenever talk of leadership contenders has emerged. He has built up an impressive CV in government since the Conservatives came to power in 2010, being first awarded the job of transport secretary before his promotion to defence secretary where he stayed for three years. He's regarded by many commentators as being a potential candidate for the Tory right. He seems to have work to do among party activists, scoring only 4% in ConservativeHome's future leader poll.Latest odds: 12/1"
2015-04-09,Cereal number,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-magazine-monitor-31962592,"David Cameron has declared he won't seek a third term as prime minister, citing an advertising slogan for Shredded Wheat used in the UK more than 30 years ago. What's its enduring power, asks Justin Parkinson.The hotel kitchen staff are in disbelief. Someone in room 147 has ordered three Shredded Wheat. The maid transports them upstairs to find England cricketer Ian Botham waiting at a table, dressed in full whites.The maid leaves. Botham hides one of the Shredded Wheat under a napkin and winks to camera. Cue music, as the slogan ""Shredded Wheat. Bet you can't eat three"" appears.This advert and others featuring football manager Brian Clough and the actor Richard Kiel, who played Jaws in James Bond films, have not run for some time. Nestle, which owns the brand, says the last probably aired in 1984.But their message seems to have waned little. Telling the BBC he would only serve a limited time in Downing Street, David Cameron said: ""Terms are like Shredded Wheat - two are wonderful but three might just be too many.""The prime minister's reprise was unlikely to be accidental, says Thayne Forbes, joint managing director of the brand-valuation company Intangible Business. ""Everybody would empathise with the view that three Shredded Wheat would probably be too much,"" he says. ""The slogan suggests people shouldn't overdo it. It sounds modest and reasoned.""As marketing goes, it might seem counter-intuitive, as it discourages excessive consumption. But it also sounds honest and unexploitative.Other advertising slogans and themes are in wide use in public and political discourse. Examples include Marmite being a by-word for divisiveness - a ""Marmite person"" is either loved or hated. Cameron has twice referred to Ronseal - the woodcare product that does ""exactly what it says on the tin"". But Shredded Wheat, its best-known slogan having lain dormant for so long, appears to be used less often. The cereal, created in the US in the 1890s, has long been sold as good for the evolving British lifestyle. A newspaper advert in 1902 described it as ""a relief from the monotony of everlasting porridge"", while, by 1943, it was ""an ideal food for all war workers"". The 1980s saw an emphasis on ""simple, honest goodness"", while, in the 2000s, its long heritage and reliability was promoted.""It's a good association for Cameron,"" says Forbes. ""He must have been brought up on it, like lots of other people. It will be great marketing for Shredded Wheat to have the slogan used after so many years, too.""Subscribe to the BBC News Magazine's email newsletter to get articles sent to your inbox"
2015-04-09,Are you 'cosmopolitan'?,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32021853,"The rise of UKIP heralds the emergence of a new divide in British politics, with cosmopolitan voters on one side and non-cosmopolitan ones on the other, argues Jeremy Cliffe.We hear a lot about UKIP these days. The party stole the show at the local and European elections last year, then again in the autumn when it lured two Conservative MPs to defect.  In the past weeks alone there have been three much-discussed television programmes about the party: ""Meet the Ukippers"", ""Farage Fans and UKIP Lovers"" and ""100 Days of UKIP"". At the upcoming general election the party will probably increase its share of seats in Westminster - and will certainly affect the results in dozens of other constituencies by taking votes from the other parties. But ask some of those academics who have been watching UKIP's rise, and they will tell you that it is just one part of a bigger story. We are all used to the left-right divide in politics: a spectrum of different views on how much the government should tax, spend, regulate and otherwise intervene in the economy. But according to Dr Rob Ford of Manchester University, UKIP exists on a different axis, one to do with cultural rather than economic matters. This new political scale is ever more prominent in British political life.Radio 4's Analysis programmeOn the one end of it is what you might call a ""cosmopolitan"" philosophy: a relaxed, liberal attitude to issues concerning national identity (like immigration) and to questions of morality and lifestyle (like gay marriage). On the other end is a ""non-cosmopolitan"" outlook: more nationalist, socially conservative and less comfortable with social change, or in other words the ideological stance often associated with typical UKIP voters. This divide cuts across the left-right scale: there are cosmopolitan and non-cosmopolitan voters in both the Conservative and the Labour camps, which is why UKIP takes support from both.Lots of things are making this cosmopolitanism divide more important. One is that the old class-based, ideological conflict between left and right has declined. Dr James Tilley of Oxford University argues that politicians are partly to blame. The economic philosophies of the Conservative and Labour parties are so similar, he argues, that other, cultural issues are becoming more important. Another factor is the growing gap between the generations: the difference in outlook between the cosmopolitan young and less cosmopolitan, older voters is greater than it was in the past (partly due to the recent rise in levels of university education, which tend to correlate with liberal views). This trend presents the established parties with some difficult questions. As Dr Ford puts it, they ""have to try and deal with this rising value divide, particularly now that UKIP has mobilised it into the political debate."" ""They have to make a move,"" he adds, ""but any move that they make risks making their position worse with one or the other of these groups of voters."" Sound too cosmopolitan, and the parties risk losing supporters to UKIP. Try to ""out-UKIP UKIP"", and they could alienate their younger, more socially liberal supporters. So both are doing the political splits, trying to reconcile the cosmopolitans within their ranks with the non-cosmopolitans. Witness the tortuous attempts by Ed Miliband to sound tough on immigration without sounding too tough. Witness, too, the recent struggles of David Cameron to persuade social conservatives in his party that gay marriage can be an innately conservative institution. In the long-term, this divide will become less problematic. That is because over the years the country will tilt towards the cosmopolitan end of this new spectrum. So says Penny Young of NatCen, the research organisation that conducts the extensive British Social Attitudes survey. Various demographic factors explain this trend. The country as a whole is becoming more accepting of same-sex relationships. Younger voters are more relaxed about things like immigration and national identity than were previous generations when they were young, suggesting that the overall population will tilt in an internationalist direction over time. And ever more parts of the country are acquiring the ethnic and social diversity once confined to the inner cities, a trend that generally makes people more comfortable with immigration. According to Dr Ford the question is therefore: how should the main political parties navigate this period of transition? It would be wrong to simply abandon the swathes of voters at the less cosmopolitan end of the scale; voters who are usually older and more isolated than the average member of the population.Yet the politicians do need to adapt to the changing attitudes of British society and be honest with voters rather than pandering to views that, deep down, they do not share. This quandary may not decide the upcoming general election, but in the established parties savvy strategists with an eye to elections in 2020 and beyond are grappling with it nonetheless. That is a wise move."
2015-04-09,Dudley debate,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32015334,"I met Afzal Amin for the first time on Friday, but I already knew who he was. In Dudley North, the seat he was selected by the Conservatives to fight in the general election, Mr Amin had become hard to avoid. When I first looked at the local newspaper online, the pages were surrounded by ""Amin"" logos in the preferred Tory shade of blue.Not long after we met, he asked me to pose for a photo, snapped by one of his campaign team, and doubtless rapidly tweeted out to followers of the would-be MP.Perhaps no surprise that the man running such a disciplined operation has served in the army and been to Sandhurst. That was very much the message he delivered on Friday, as he addressed school and college pupils at a hustings in Dudley which I'd been invited to chair.There was combative debate, too, not least with his Labour rival, the MP Ian Austin. Both men knew the Dudley contest was critical for their respective parties; Ian Austin held the seat by just over 600 votes in 2010. Just as David Cameron was denied a majority by failing to take seats like this one, so Ed Miliband is unlikely to be in No 10 if Labour loses Dudley North.He was self-confident and fluent. The only obvious mis-step came right at the end, when he interrupted Vicky Duckworth, the Green candidate for the neighbouring seat. She expressed the opinion that politics often seemed to be about men shouting at each other; Mr Amin complained she was engaging in gender bias.A few weeks ago, one Conservative MP who knows him well and respects his talents, said Afzal Amin had warned him of the risks of over-confidence. He thought he risked running before he could walk.Well, he stumbled badly this weekend. Whatever the purpose of his contacts with the English Defence League - and he strongly disputes claims that he wanted them to hold a protest that would then be called off, for which he could then take the credit - the exposure has damaged him and, potentially, the prospects of his party re-taking the seat.In February, the EDL staged a rally against plans for a new mosque in the town. As the Mail on Sunday story makes clear, Afzal Amin pleaded with them beforehand not to hold that demonstration; but it went ahead anyway. It's what happened subsequently which will feature in Tuesday's disciplinary hearing.Over the weekend, I put his defence to a very senior Conservative source - that this was an attempt to broker a compromise in order to bring together a divided community. The arch response: Dudley isn't Kandahar.Nor do I think from my visits to the town, where I'm going to be based for the general election, will people in Dudley appreciate being painted as somewhere riven by racial discord.True, Dudley was the scene of one of England's earliest race riots. But that was in 1962. Although the controversy over replacing the mosque - currently in a converted school and inadequate for the numbers who want to worship there - has been running for a decade, community relations are generally good. Even those who don't want a new mosque didn't want the EDL protestors - nor to be fair the anti-fascist counter-demonstrators who followed them.As for the Conservative Party, the view of the national leadership is that you don't collaborate with the EDL. Not least because the Tories are still struggling to bury some historic baggage in the Black Country: Enoch Powell was an MP in Wolverhampton when he delivered his Rivers of Blood speech about immigration in 1968.Four years before that, there was the notorious election in Smethwick which the Conservatives were accused of winning by wooing white voters with an offensive rhyme suggesting who'd they'd get as a neighbour if they voted Labour. Afzal Amin grew up in Smethwick so he should be aware of that history. He was, until his suspension on Saturday, one of about 17% of Conservative parliamentary candidates who are not white. The party is proud of that, but it's still struggling to translate that into votes.Afzal Amin may believe that he can persuade the party to lift the suspension when he meets party officials on Tuesday. I have my doubts. Even if they accept his defence, will the other parties be so charitable? The allegations would follow him on the campaign trail, and make planned visits by cabinet ministers next to impossible.On Friday, just before the hustings in Dudley began, Afzal Amin gave me his business card. It introduces him as 'prospective member of Parliament Dudley North'. I think I'll keep it; it could yet become a collector's item."

2015-04-10,Bid to change Speaker election rules,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32061097,"A last-minute bid to change the way the Speaker of the House of Commons is elected is to be debated by MPs.Labour criticised the government motion, to be debated on the final day before the dissolution of Parliament, saying the Conservatives were ""trying to play politics with the speakership"".Under the proposals, a secret ballot would decide whether there should be a contested election for the post.MPs currently have to file through the division lobbies to cast their vote.This means it is clear who does or does not back the incumbent as Speaker.Labour's shadow leader of the Commons Angela Eagle raised the party's concerns in the House on Wednesday evening, questioning whether the motion was within parliamentary rules.Current Speaker John Bercow is - technically - one of them, but many Tory MPs have never liked him.They resent his personal style and some believe he is far from impartial in the way he conducts business in the Commons.Attempts by some to force a vote on his resumption as Speaker in 2010 came to nothing. There have been the occasional measured jibes at him from the prime minister. Other Tories reportedly went much further and formed a group whose members had all been reprimanded by him. But the Speaker is a reformer who believes passionately that the people who elect the members, and pay the bills, should come first.The last act of the coalition looks like being an attempt to unseat him. And they are very serious about it.One Tory MP fighting an important marginal seat had been cleared by his party to be away from Parliament but he is now staying for the vote, such is the importance of it.She told Deputy Speaker Lindsay Hoyle: ""It's just come to my attention that the government has tabled a motion for debate on the final day of this Parliament, with no notice whatsoever to myself as shadow leader of the House, proposing changes to the way in which the Speaker of this House is elected.""Procedural matters in this House, with no consultation with the opposition, no consultation with the chair of the committee itself, for debate in only one hour tomorrow.""Mr Hoyle said the motion had been ""rightly or wrongly"" agreed to on Tuesday, saying that ""business of the House is decided by the government, not by the chair.""A spokesman for Commons Leader William Hague said the motion had been tabled as a free hour had opened up in Thursday's business after the House of Lords approved the Modern Slavery Bill.The proposed change would apply when a Speaker wishes to continue in the post after a general election.Under the current rules, if the Speaker's re-appointment is objected to, a division is held, with MPs choosing to back or oppose the Speaker in the division lobbies.The replacement of this method with a secret ballot was suggested in 2010 by a committee of MPs, which said the public method ""can be seen as a deterrent to the House expressing its views honestly"".MPs will now debate whether this change should be made."

2015-04-10,MPs warn on growth of UK jihadists,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32059813,"Not enough is being done to prevent people leaving the UK to join Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, a group of MPs has warned.Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said Britain must win their ""hearts and minds"".The committee's report comes as the BBC launches a database tracking British jihadists in Syria and Iraq. It shows that many people left in clusters from certain UK areas - often due to friendships and peer groups. The MPs' report argued that preventative work with communities, families and international partners was ""vital"" and needs to be a top priority for the Home Office.  ""The number of cases being brought to public attention should ring alarm bells,"" said Labour MP Mr Vaz.  ""This must be a relentless battle for hearts and minds, and without a strong counter-narrative we are in danger of failing to prevent even more departures. We are at the edge of a cliff."" The BBC has been tracking the stories of the men, women, boys and girls who have gone to Syria and Iraq to understand why they go, where they go from and what happens to them. By analysing around 160 profiles, it reveals the way in which people have travelled in clusters - a group of three young friends from Coventry, another group from Portsmouth, drawn out by one person they knew, others in Cardiff linked to people involved in an extremist organisation. Social media might play a part but face-to-face contact appears just as, if not more, important, according to the database.It includes the stories of: The BBC research emphasises the extent to which real-world contacts, rather than just online connections, are often a key driver of radicalisation and intent to travel to Iraq and Syria. Some of the experts who appeared before the Home Affairs Committee also argued the internet was a secondary influence. They said that universities and prisons were among the two most significant places where radicalisation occurred. A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police, which was not aware of the report, said it would have ""welcomed the opportunity"" to have given evidence to the committee and that it planned to look at the report in detail.The disappearance of schoolgirls Shamima Begum, Amira Abase, both 15, and Kadiza Sultana, 16, from east London in February, raised questions as to who could have done more to prevent their departure. After taking evidence from the police and the families of the girls among others, Mr Vaz said their case suffered from a ""lack of immediate action"". He added: ""Schools and the police must inform parents immediately, and work with them even if there is the smallest hint of radicalisation, or a close association with someone who is thought to have been radicalised.""However, the Met Police spokesman defended the speed of the police response to the schoolgirls' disappearance.  He said the committee's criticism was ""misleading"", pointing to the evidence given by both UK and Turkish authorities of ""rapid exchanges"" between the two.The committee's report said there needed to be an advice service which would be a less extreme step than calling the anti-terrorist hotline.The Association of Chief Police Officer's lead officer for the government's anti-terror strategy Prevent, Chief Constable Sir Peter Fahy, agreed that more needed to be done.However, he said the police ""do not have the capacity"" to routinely work with every school in the country.He added: ""The police service will play its part but the prime responsibility for dissuading young people from getting involved in extremist activity has to lie with parents, families and carers.""The committee also pointed to weaknesses in information sharing with airlines and other countries. It said greater care needed to be taken at airport check-in desks when people were travelling to destinations of concern - namely Syria, Somalia, Iraq and Nigeria, as well as neighbouring countries, such as Turkey. The report said police also needed to work faster to alert overseas partners and airlines when there were concerns over individuals.There were signs that some of the girls had followed extremist accounts on social media, the report said.The committee said that social media companies, such as Facebook and Twitter, should be prepared to suspend accounts when there is evidence they are being used to promote violent extremism.  The report also said it was disappointed the Home Office had not implemented a programme for individuals returning to Britain where there is evidence they had fought in Syria.Security officials estimate that some 600 Britons have left the country to join IS - and while around half may have returned, many are still out there - and some have died.  The BBC project includes detailed profiles of individuals which can be searched, based on hometown, age and gender, as well as those who have been convicted in the courts or who are believed to have been killed."

If not, the prince's private letters will either remain confidential, as the sender intended, or they'll be exposed to a large and inquisitive audience.

That will be a clear pledge from us.""He accused Mr Cameron of making an ""out of the blue, panicky"" announcement on VAT that ""no one in Britain will believe"".Labour, which has already announced plans to increase the top rate of income tax and impose a new ""mansion tax"" on high value properties, insists its plans are fully costed and will not require additional tax hikes if it wins May's general election.Mr Miliband began his final head-to-head encounter with Mr Cameron before the election by joking that the PM had ""announced his retirement plans"" - a reference to a BBC interview in which the prime minister said he would not serve a third term if the Tories remained in power.Challenging Mr Cameron to give a ""straight answer to a straight question"", Mr Miliband pressed him on whether he would rule out a rise in VAT after the election, as Labour had done.In response, the prime minister immediately said ""yes"", prompting loud cheers in turn from the Conservative benches. He contrasted what he said was a ""clear promise"" with Labour's unwillingness to rule out a rise in National Insurance.""I answered a very simple question about VAT. I ruled out an increase... straight answer to him, straight question from me. I have ruled out VAT. Will he rule out national insurance contributions. Yes or no?"" Mr Cameron added: ""We all know this is Labour's job tax. This is their tax of choice. This is what they clobber working people, families and enterprises with.""But Mr Miliband responded by saying there was ""only one person who is going to raise taxes on working families and that is him"".He said nobody would believe Mr Cameron on VAT ""because of his extreme spending plans, because his numbers do not add up and because he promised it last time and broke his promise"".Mr Cameron, he added, had broken other promises made before the last election to reduce annual net migration below 100,000 and not to pursue a major structural re-organisation of the NHS, adding that it was ""time for a better plan and time for a Labour government"".But Mr Cameron suggested a future Labour government would result in the ""chaos of economic crisis"", with Ed Miliband being ""held hostage"" by the SNP.The packed session provided a last opportunity for the two men to rally their MPs and set out their arguments before the start of the election campaign next week.Speaking after the exchanges and the other parties' tax pledges, deputy prime minister Nick Clegg said the Lib Dems ""don't need to raise VAT, national insurance or headline rates of income tax or corporation tax either"".""There are other taxes and other tax loopholes that we can increase or close in order to balance the books,"" he said.

2015-04-10,Met police 'had files on MPs in 90s',https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32044580,"A former undercover police officer has told BBC News that Scotland Yard kept intelligence files on MPs during the 1990s. Ex-Special Branch officer Peter Francis says he saw files on 10 Labour MPs which he and others regularly updated. He says he personally gathered information on three MPs as part of his work infiltrating left-wing groups. The MPs named, and Labour, have called for a forthcoming public inquiry into undercover policing to be widened. Mr Francis operated undercover between 1993 and 1997 in the Met's now disbanded Special Demonstration Squad. He was told to embed himself in left-wing groups or causes that were deemed to pose a potential threat to security. He says that during this period he was told to gather intelligence on MPs and their activities if and when they featured in any of his operations. That information, he says, was added to a special pink file that was available for Special Branch officers to read. Between 1990 and 2001, he claims to have personally seen records relating to Diane Abbott, the late Tony Benn, Jeremy Corbyn, the late Bernie Grant, Peter Hain, Harriet Harman, Ken Livingstone, Joan Ruddock, Dennis Skinner and Jack Straw.Four of the group became ministers during Mr Francis's time in Special Branch - including Jack Straw who was home secretary after 1997. ""When I was deployed undercover in the Special Demonstration Squad, any MP that I came across, such as on demonstrations, I would report back on them,"" he said. Mr Francis says that the files not only contained the MPs' publicly-stated political views - but also intelligence on what was going on behind the scenes in the party or their group. He says some of the information would have been things said in private by the MP, depending on how close each undercover officer had been able to get. Mr Francis said that when he first saw the files he understood that each had probably been created before the individual was an MP because of their personal involvement in radical causes or protests.But he added: ""When they became MPs these files carried on. It [was] your duty as an SDS officer to report back any intelligence that you come across. ""I felt that it was OK to report back on MPs,"" he said. ""I used to give myself a pat on the back, thinking 'I have done a good job'. These MPs were spied on and they should know.""""I don't think the police force should be monitoring MPs, full stop. I don't think we have any right to do that at all. It may be justifiable to say that the Security Service should be doing it - but I certainly don't think the police should be doing it.""Scotland Yard has refused to comment on the substance of the claims, but a spokesman said it had not shied away from serious allegations about the SDS. It said that Operation Herne, the internal police investigation into what happened in the unit, remained an ongoing investigation.""Operation Herne maintains that without speaking to Peter Francis it is simply not possible to fully investigate allegations he makes,"" said a spokesman. ""Operation Herne remains very willing to engage with him.""Mr Francis said that he has refused to speak to Operation Herne because he fears being interviewed under caution as a suspect, rather than a whistleblower. Scotland Yard told the BBC that Operation Herne detectives would be prepared to speak to him as a witness. He has, however, spoken to Mark Ellison QC who reviewed allegations about the SDS for the Home Secretary Theresa May - prompting her to launch a statutory inquiry. He says he will appear before those hearings. Peter Hain, who was a leader of the anti-apartheid movement in the late 1960s and 70s and became an MP in 1991, said he now wants full answers from Scotland Yard. ""I was deeply disturbed to find that files were still being kept by the Special Branch while I and others were serving Members of Parliament,"" he said. ""That is constitutionally an outrage. It infringes the sovereignty of Parliament. ""I want to see the home secretary widen the scope of the inquiry into the SDS to look specifically at the surveillance of MPs and the fact that there were active files on us while we were serving Members of Parliament. ""This should never have happened and it should have been reported and properly authorised - and we don't know whether it was.""Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper echoed the call for the inquiry to be widened in light of what she described as ""extremely serious and disturbing allegations"".""While undercover policing remains a crucial tool in combating serious and organised crime it must not be abused,"" she said.""There have now been a series of serious allegations about undercover policing - ranging from the treatment of Stephen Lawrence's family to police having long-term inappropriate relationships. ""We called some time ago for much stronger oversight of undercover policing and it is also vital to get to the truth about what has happened."" Mrs May announced earlier this month that Lord Justice Pitchford would lead the inquiry into the SDS allegations - but the precise shape of that inquiry is not yet clear.A Home Office spokesman said the review by Mark Ellison QC had unearthed ""serious historical failings"". ""That is why the Home Secretary established a public inquiry to thoroughly investigate undercover policing and the operation of the Special Demonstration Squad. ""Lord Justice Pitchford will consult interested parties to the inquiry over the coming months on setting the terms of reference, with a view to publishing these at the end of July.""Undercover policing is an essential tactic in the fight against crime but to improve the public's confidence in undercover work we must ensure there is no repeat of these failings in the future."""
2015-04-10,NHS problems worst 'since 1990s',https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/health-32057948,"Services in the NHS in England are deteriorating in a way not seen since the early 1990s, according to a leading health think tank. The King's Fund review said waiting times for A&E, cancer care and routine operations had all started getting worse, while deficits were growing.It said such drops in performance had not been seen for 20 years.But the think tank acknowledged the NHS had done as well as could be expected, given the financial climate.Professor John Appleby, chief economist at the King's Fund, which specialises in health care policy, said: ""The next government will inherit a health service that has run out of money and is operating at the very edge of its limits. ""There is now a real risk that patient care will deteriorate as service and financial pressures become overwhelming.""He said in terms of how standards were slipping - not how low they had reached - the situation was the worst it had been since the ""early 1990s"".The report noted much of the deterioration has happened in the second-half of the Parliament with many measures of performance being maintained in the first few years.It said the next government had to address the funding situation, adding the extra £8bn a year NHS England says is needed by 2020, was the ""minimum"" that would be required.The report - a review of performance this Parliament - highlights a range of problems as well as achievements. These include:The report is the second part of the King's Fund pre-election review of the NHS this Parliament.Last month it warned the coalition government's reforms of the health service had been ""damaging and distracting"".The King's Fund report should make worrying reading. The reference to the 1990s conjures up images of - for the NHS at least - a bygone era. The think tank's point was not that waiting times had reached the level they were at then, rather that this is the first time in two decades of almost continuous improvement that there has been a sustained drop in performance.In many ways, that had to happen. Services cannot keep getting better for ever. Nonetheless, the findings are crystal clear: the NHS is at a critical juncture. But what is less easy to determine is to what extent the coalition's policies have contributed to the difficulties.The think tank has already provided a critical analysis of the government's reforms - and when pushed, acknowledged the health service may have been ""in better shape"" if they had not happened.But the more significant issue for the health of the health service this Parliament has been the squeeze on finances. Even though the budget has been increased, it has felt more like a cut to many because demands have risen so quickly.On this though, the King's Fund accepted that the government's hands were tied. Given the state of the economy, ministers did as much as they could have.Read more from NickRoyal College of Nursing general secretary Peter Carter said politicians needed to take note of the warnings made by the King's Fund.""Morale is low, and more and more staff are being made sick with stress because of the intolerable pressure they are under,"" he added. Katherine Murphy, of the Patients Association, said: ""The findings echo what we are hearing on a daily basis on our helpline. It is clear to the public that the future of the NHS is one of the most important issues facing the nation and it should be a central issue in the election campaign.""Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham said: ""Five years ago David Cameron stood on a promise to protect the NHS. This report provides authoritative proof that he has broken that promise.""But a Department of Health spokesman said: ""As the King's Fund says, the NHS has 'performed well in the face of huge challenges', but if we are to continue to invest in the NHS going forward it needs to be backed by a strong economy.""

2015-04-10,SNP 'could block Tory government',https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32045419,"The SNP would block a minority Conservative government by voting down its Queen's Speech if it holds the post-election balance of power, its former leader Alex Salmond has said.Mr Salmond said the move could bring down the government if Labour joined in, with David Cameron ""locked out"".The Conservatives accused him of ""trying to sabotage the democratic will of the British people"".Labour has called his balance of power prediction ""bluster and bluff"".In recent days Mr Salmond, who is bidding to become a Westminster MP at the 7 May general election, has claimed his party could ""hold the power"" in a hung Parliament and would be able to influence the Budget of a minority Labour government.This was dismissed by Labour leader Ed Miliband, who has ruled out a formal coalition with the Scottish nationalists.The SNP currently has six MPs at Westminster, but recent opinion polls suggest its share could increase dramatically at the general election.James Cook, BBC News Scotland correspondentIf the Conservatives attempt to form a minority government and enough MPs vote against their Queen's Speech the administration would fall at the first hurdle and the leader of the opposition would have a shot at forming a government.That's how parliamentary democracy works in the event of a hung Parliament.And yet the Conservatives are saying that by planning to vote against a government he opposes Alex Salmond has ""confirmed he would sabotage the democratic will of the British people in order to make Ed Miliband prime minister"".It is part of their continuing attempt to portray Mr Miliband as a weak leader whose strings are being pulled by Mr Salmond.This kind of language causes despair among Tories north of the border who fear that the party in London is waltzing into an SNP trap.They know that many voters in Scotland will read the phrase ""democratic will of the British people"" and hear ""democratic will of the English people"".Because, if it is illegitimate for Scottish MPs, from whatever party, to vote against one government and support another in the British parliament, then what, voters may ask, is the point of the union?Who is dancing to Mr Salmond's tune now?Mr Salmond, the former Scottish first minister, told the New Statesman that in the event of a hung Parliament, a minority Conservative government would have to ""go straight effectively for a vote of confidence - usually the Queen's Speech, although it could be otherwise, of course - and we'd be voting against.""If David Cameron lost this vote, he said, there would be a two-week period for another government to be formed.BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said Mr Salmond had ""hardened his anti-Conservative rhetoric"" in the interview.A Conservative spokesman said:  ""Alex Salmond has confirmed he would sabotage the democratic will of the British people in order to make Ed Miliband prime minister. ""That would mean chaos for Britain, with weak Ed Miliband dancing to Alex Salmond's tune.""He said the ""only way to keep Britain together"" was to vote Conservative.Mr Salmond's latest comments come after Mr Miliband said the only people writing a future Labour Budget would be himself and shadow chancellor Ed Balls.Speaking in Clydebank on Monday, he added: ""It's not going to be Alex Salmond - not in a million years."""
2015-04-10,MPs criticise 'lack of EU debate',https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32045290,"The government's ""failure"" to let MPs debate EU legislation is ""deplorable"", a Parliamentary committee says.The European Scrutiny Committee said ministers had refused to schedule debates on issues such as free movement and the EU's Budget.It also said BBC coverage of EU matters should be ""improved substantially"".The government said the number of EU debates had doubled since 2009-10, while the BBC said its coverage was ""extensive and impartial"".The cross-party committee's role includes scrutinising EU documents and recommending the most important for debate in the House of Commons.Its report said in the period covering most of the 2014-15 financial year there were three debates on the floor of the House, compared with 12 in 2013-14.It also pointed out that not a single debate had taken place during a nine-month period, between 9 June 2014 and 9 March 2015.""The government's collective failure to schedule so many debates on EU documents over the past year is deplorable, and is a discourtesy to this committee and to all members of the House,"" the MPs said.Prime Minister David Cameron has sought to rally support from other EU leaders for his plans to curb welfare payments to European migrants ahead of a referendum on the UK's membership if he wins the general election.The committee said the government's ""cavalier"" approach was ""at odds with UK ministers' claims in their speeches across the EU about the role of national parliaments"".The Foreign Office said the government was committed to a ""strong EU scrutiny system that enables Parliament to hold it to account for the decisions taken in Brussels"".It added: ""We have made good on our commitment to raise standards by doubling the number of Europe debates on the floor of the House since 2009-10.""This government has also increased by around a fifth since 2010 the number of EU proposals that have been scrutinised and cleared by Parliament before being agreed in Brussels.""The committee has also been examining the BBC's coverage of European issues, taking evidence from director general Lord Hall and head of news James Harding earlier this month.During that appearance, Lord Hall said the desire for balanced output ""ran deep"" within the BBC and he believed that this was being achieved.Mr Harding said if the public was going to trust the BBC to report on politicians impartially it had to be clear that BBC journalists weren't ""asked by politicians to come and account for what they do and in effect do the bidding of those politicians"".But the committee said it was ""concerned about the manner in which the BBC treats EU issues"", calling for coverage to be ""improved substantially"".It suggested coverage did not reflect all sides of the debate on the European Union, and more analysis was needed. Its chairman, Conservative MP Sir William Cash, said the BBC had ""very particular obligations"" to be impartial and to ""educate and inform"".He added:  ""We do not believe this is currently being achieved in the context of the BBC's EU coverage.""A BBC spokesman said the corporation provided extensive and impartial coverage of European and Parliamentary issues, and it would be a breach of the corporation's independence if a committee of MPs instructed the BBC on its coverage."
2015-04-10,Lobbyists must 'conform' with rules,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32047992,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe woman in charge of the government's new register of lobbyists has said she expects the industry to ""conform"" with the statutory system. Speaking ahead of the register's launch, Alison White conceded a lot of lobbyists would not be listed on it.But she said her job was to make sure the rules were implemented and she would do so with ""extreme verve and vigour.""But one critic of the register said it was ""fake"" and full of ""loopholes"".Lobbyists are companies or individuals paid to influence government decisions.The coalition promised to introduce a statutory register of lobbyists when it came to power in 2010, and legislation was passed last year, with ministers saying the move would help clean up politics.However, the new register will only cover consultant lobbyists and will not apply to lobbyists working ""in-house"" for companies or organisations.A person or company will only need to be registered if they are contacting a government minister or permanent secretary in a government department - leading to criticism it will not come close to reflecting the scale or nature of lobbying that goes on across Whitehall.But Ms White, who is independent of the government, said her task was to implement the law as it stood not to question the powers she had been given. ""We are having something that has never been in place before,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""This is a statutory register. The industry tells me it is a professional industry. I expect them to conform with the legislation. It is my job to make sure they do so.""Ms White, who was appointed as the registrar of consultant lobbyists in September, acknowledged the register would not indicate different ""levels of lobbying"".""The legislation was quite narrowly drafted to address a particular issue, which was that it was not always particularly clear, when ministers were being lobbied, who the client of the lobbyist was. That is what the register was set up to do,"" she said.She added: ""This will give anyone who wishes to access the register the opportunity to be able to see who is lobbying and being paid for it and who their clients are. That is the main information the register will contain.""If a lobbyist sets out to influence government policy in some way, they would have to be registered. If they are not registered, then they would not be conforming. They have to go on the register before they lobby.""Ms White said last month that the register would not have any entries on its launch day but she had received more than ""20 expressions of interest"" about joining and companies and individuals might be required to sign up retrospectively.Potential registrants will be able to log on and create an account to file an ""information return"".But Tamasin Cave, from the Alliance for Lobbying Transparency coalition, said ""hardly anyone"" in the industry would be covered by the provisions of the new law. ""You have a huge commercial lobbying industry, and very few of them will have to sign up,"" she told Today.""The second flaw is that it won't show the interaction between lobbyists and government, and that is what a register is for.""It is to show the activity - who is discussing what with whom, but this shows nothing of this interaction. It is a fake register."""
2015-04-10,Car smoking ban MSP welcomes backing,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-south-scotland-32055226,"The Liberal Democrat MSP behind a bill to ban smoking in cars when children are present has welcomed the support of the Scottish government.South of Scotland MSP Jim Hume launched the members' bill in December.The government said it was ""very supportive"" of the principles of the bill, but changes could be needed to make it ""workable"".Motorists could potentially be fined £100 for breaching the rule if it becomes law.Mr Hume lodged draft proposals for a bill last May calling for a ban in Scotland on smoking in private vehicles when children under 18 were present.He said he was ""over the moon"" at the news the Scottish government would endorse the Smoking Prohibition (Children in Motor Vehicles) (Scotland) Bill.He said: ""With cross-party support and the support of many third sector organisations, there is every chance that this could be in place in the next year.""Eighty-four per cent of the 160 responses to my consultation were positive and people from across Scotland have expressed their support for the move.""The bill is about guaranteeing that children in Scotland can have the freedom to go on and lead healthy lives if they choose to.""I look forward to working with MSPs from all parties as the bill progresses.""Public Health Minister Maureen Watt said the Scottish government had considered including the measure in its Public Health Bill, but instead decided to support Mr Hume's proposals.She said: ""As with any bill, as it goes through the scrutiny process, there may be amendments and improvements to strengthen the legislation and ensure it is fit for purpose. ""But we believe that the underpinning principles are strong, and that is why I am pleased to support it.""Scottish Labour and a wide range of health organisations have backed his proposals.But the Scottish Conservatives have reservations about how the bill would work in practice.The party's health spokesman Jackson Carlaw said: ""While Scottish Conservatives support any moves which would protect young people from hazardous second hand smoke we have concerns as to how this would be enforced.""It would be a better use of resources to conduct a public awareness campaign similar to that which is being proposed by the government in Wales.""We will be watching this campaign in order to ascertain what lessons may be learned and what approaches may be adopted in Scotland.""Anti-smoking campaigners welcomed the Scottish government's backing for Mr Hume's bill.ASH Scotland's chief executive Sheila Duffy said: ""It is another public health initiative that can help Scotland move forward with its ambition to achieve a tobacco-free generation in 20 years' time.""It is popular with the public and will bring Scotland into line with upcoming legislation in England and Wales.""We believe it can be effectively enforced and that having the legislation focus on cars with children bypasses concerns over interference in people's private lives.""Jim Hume must be congratulated for taking the initiative on this proposal and for all the hard work he and his team have done to bring this important measure forward.""But Simon Clark, director of the smokers' group Forest, said the bill was ""legislation for legislation's sake"".He said: ""Smoking in cars carrying children is inconsiderate. The overwhelming majority of smokers know that and don't do it.""The very small number that do will carry on regardless because the law will be difficult, if not impossible, to enforce.""Education has to be better than legislation but the government prefers gesture politics and the big stick."""
2015-04-10,Candidate quits over UKIP MEP remark,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32038485,"A UKIP election candidate has quit the party over comments made by the party's only Scottish MEP about a Scottish government minister.Tim Wilson has decided not to stand in South Northamptonshire after David Coburn MEP compared Humza Yousaf to convicted terrorist Abu Hamza.Mr Coburn has apologised for the remarks, saying it was a ""joke"".A spokesman for UKIP said Mr Wilson had failed to emphasise local issues in his general election campaign.UKIP leader Nigel Farage said Mr Coburn's remarks were a ""joke in poor taste"" but he would not be taking any action against him.But Mr Wilson said he was disillusioned with the party over the ""racist jibes"" and has decided to stand down.He told BBC Scotland he was appalled by Mr Coburn's comments about Mr Yousaf and frustrated by the inaction of the party's leadership on the issue.  He said David Coburn had produced ""what I can only describe as an Islamaphobic insult, and that's simply not acceptable"".  Mr Wilson added: ""Of course he went on and apologised.  I think, frankly, that if you are in a position of power you have to be able to control what ideas emerge from your head and how they get to your mouth and, in fact, you shouldn't have those ideas in the first place.  ""But the real issue is that when Mr Farage was asked what he thought about this he dismissed this as a joke.  ""I don't think this is a joke. I think this is something very serious.  It may not be that this man intended to cause offence but we aren't interested in what his intentions are.  We are interested in the effect what he says has on other people and the effect is catastrophic, it's appalling and I've resigned.""In his resignation letter, Mr Wilson said he had been ""systematically gagged by the party whip"" and forbidden to speak about Islam favourably. A spokesman for UKIP said Mr Wilson had failed to put more emphasis on local issues in his campaign.He said: ""Whilst we had initially been optimistic about Tim Wilson's abilities as a candidate, it became obvious in recent weeks that he was out of his depth in representing our party in the way we would expect. ""Mr Wilson had clearly misunderstood the expectations that UKIP place on all of its candidates. Principal amongst those is focusing on issues that are relevant to local voters. UKIP put huge emphasis on local issues and Mr Wilson was unwilling to follow UKIP guidelines in this respect.""Last week MSPs at the Scottish Parliament unanimously condemned the remarks made by Mr Coburn during a newspaper interview.MSPs were debating a motion celebrating Scotland's diverse communities.The president of the European Parliament, Martin Schulz, condemned the remarks, saying they were ""not worthy of any elected member"". But a spokesman for the president said he could not act on remarks made outside parliament.The move comes just days after another candidate, Jonathan Stanley, quit in protest at the ""racist filth"" in UKIP. Mr Stanley, who was due to stand in the Cumbrian seat of Westmorland and Lonsdale, was the party's former head of policy in Scotland."

2015-04-10,Manifesto watch,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-29642613,"Political parties are putting together their manifestos for May's general election. Here's a guide to where they currently stand on the issues voters say they care about most (according to pollsters IPSOS Mori).ImmigrationConservatives:  David Cameron wants to make migrants wait four years before they can claim certain benefits, such as tax credits, Universal Credit, or get access to social housing. He wants to stop migrants from claiming child benefit for dependents living outside the UK, and remove those that have failed to find work after six months. Mr Cameron has promised to put reform of EU free movement rules at the heart of his renegotiation of Britain's relationship with the EU. He has ruled out a temporary cap on migrant numbers or an ""emergency brake"" on EU freedom of movement rules - ideas both mooted in recent months, saying this would be less ""effective"" than reducing the incentives for people to come to the UK. The party has a continuing goal to bring net immigration down to below 100,000 people a year (it currently stands at 243,000).Labour: ""Stronger"" border controls to tackle illegal immigration with ""proper"" entry and exit checks. ""Smarter"" targets to reduce low-skilled migration but ensure university students and high-skilled workers are not deterred. Employment agencies who only recruit abroad will be outlawed while the fines for employing illegal immigrants will be increased.Lib Dems: Reintroduce exit checks at borders, so the government can identify people who are overstaying their visa. Will require all new claimants for Jobseekers Allowance to have their English language skills assessed, with JSA then being conditional on attending language courses for those whose English is poor. Ensure that EU migrants have to ""earn"" their entitlement to benefits.SNP: Allow the devolved government to have control over immigration to Scotland, and introduce a Canadian-style earned citizenship system to attract highly-skilled immigrants.Plaid Cymru: Oppose a points-based system. Support the right of asylum seekers to work in Wales while they wait for status decisions to be made. Lobby the Westminster government to ensure that they shut ""detention"" centres.UKIP: Introduce an Australian-style points policy, used to select migrants with the skills and attributes needed to work in the country - covering people from inside and outside the EU. Bring net immigration down to 50,000 people a year. Priority lanes for UK passport holders. Increase UK border staff by 2,500. Tougher English language tests for migrants seeking permanent residence. Opt out of the Dublin treaty to allow the UK to return asylum seekers to other EU countries without considering their claim. Anyone who currently has the legal right to live, work, or study in the UK would not face deportation in the event of the country's withdrawal from the EU.Greens:  Progressively reduce UK immigration controls. Migrants illegally in the UK for over five years will be allowed to remain unless they pose a serious danger to public safety. More legal rights for asylum seekers.Taxes and the economyConservatives: Eradicate the deficit by 2018 and secure an overall budget surplus by 2019-20. Achieve this by spending cuts, not tax rises, while raising NHS spending. An income tax cut for 30 million people by 2020. Tax would start to kick in at £12,500 a year, instead of £10,500. This will cost £5.6bn. The higher tax rate, 40%, would start at £50,000 instead of £41,900, again by 2020, at a cost of £1.6bn. This will be paid for through £25bn in additional spending cuts and economic growth. No increases in VAT.Labour: Get the current budget into surplus and the national debt falling ""as soon as possible in the next parliament"". No additional borrowing for new spending. Reintroduce the 50p top rate of income tax for earnings over £150,000.  Cut income tax for 24 million people by bringing back the 10p rate, paid for by scrapping the Married Couples' Tax Allowance. Bring in a ""mansion tax"" on properties worth over £2m, to raise £1.2bn. A tax on bankers' bonuses. A 5% pay cut for every government minister. Push for UK overseas territories to be put on an international blacklist if they refuse to co-operate with a drive against tax avoidance. No increases in VAT or National Insurance contributions.Lib Dems: Raise the personal allowance - the point at which you start paying income tax - to £11,000 in April 2016 and then to £12,500 by 2020. ""Strict new fiscal rules"" to ensure the deficit has gone by April 2018, with the wealthy contributing the most. The Lib Dems invented the ""mansion tax"" but in contrast to Labour have set out how it would operate - along similar lines to council tax bands. There are also Lib Dem plans to increase capital gains tax - paid on profits from second homes or shares - from 28% to 35%. Impose an additional 8% rate of corporation tax on UK banks to raise an extra £1bn a year to help pay off the deficit.SNP: Oppose UK plans in the Infrastructure Bill which will allow oil and gas drilling and hydraulic fracturing beneath people's homes without consent. Invest in offshore wind farming. Support an international bank tax and limits to industry bonuses.Plaid Cymru: Build a Green Skills Construction College, specialising in green energy. Establish a publicly-owned energy company. Establish a publicly-owned Bank of Wales business investment bank. Enforce a living wage. Give devolved nations an equal say in institutions that affect everyone's lives, such as the Bank of England.UKIP: Increase the personal allowance to the level of full-time minimum wage earnings, about £13,500, by 2020. Abolish inheritance tax. Introduce a 35% income tax rate between £42,285 and £55,000, at which point the 40% rate becomes payable. Set up a Treasury Commission to design a turnover tax on large businesses. Cut foreign aid budget by £9bn a year. Scrap HS2. Save £8bn a year in membership fees by leaving the EU.  Lower the VAT rate charged on restorations to listed buildings.Greens: People earning more than £100,000 a year would pay 50% income tax. Wealth tax of 1% to 2% on people worth £3m or more. Renationalise the railways and energy companies. Scrap HS2. Allow councils to impose extra business rates on out-of-town supermarkets to fund small local businesses. Crackdown on tax avoidance by multinationals. Allow ""the current dependence on economic growth to cease, and allow zero or negative growth to be feasible without individual hardship"". Commit Britain to a ""zero carbon"" future. Cut rail and bus fares by an average of 10%. Enforce a cap on bankers' bonuses.The NHSConservatives:  Chancellor George Osborne says he will put an extra £2bn into frontline health services across the UK, which he described as a ""down payment"" on a plan drawn up by NHS bosses calling for an extra £8bn a year above inflation by 2020. In England, everyone would be able to see a GP seven days a week by 2020. Recruit 5,000 more doctors.Labour:  Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said Labour would commit an extra £2.5bn a year above Mr Osborne's plan. The money will come from three sources - a new ""mansion"" tax, clamping down on tax avoidance by big corporations and a new tax on tobacco companies. Patients in England would get a GP appointment within 48 hours and would not have to wait longer than a week for cancer tests and results. Scrap the Health and Social Care Act and end ""creeping privatisation"" of the NHS.  Integrate health and social care services into a system of ""whole-person care"". Give greater priority to mental health services. Replace the Cancer Drugs Fund in England when it runs out in 2016 with a £330m fund to improve access to innovative cancer drugs, surgery and radiotherapy. Recruit 5,000 more healthcare workers to help patients stay in their homes and introduce new safety checks to identify people at risk of hospitalisation. Prioritise child mental health by increasing the proportion of the mental health budget spent on children.Lib Dems: An extra £1bn for the NHS every year, to be funded by - amongst other things - making higher earners pay more tax on their shares. Half of this will go towards mental health. Ensure that spending on the NHS rises in line with growth in the economy. People who need therapy for conditions such as depression will be guaranteed treatment within 18 weeks. For young patients experiencing psychosis for the first time treatment will be provided within two weeks of being referred by a GP. This is all going to happen from April, with more mental health targets to follow if the Lib Dems return to government. Wants a cross-party review of the future of NHS funding.SNP: Reduce the number of senior managers in the NHS by 25% over the next parliament. Streamline the work of health boards. Real terms increases in year-on-year NHS spending.Plaid Cymru: Recruit 1,000 extra doctors to the Welsh NHS over two terms of a Plaid government. Offer financial incentives for recruiting doctors to areas and specialisms where there are, or are predicted to be, shortages. Encourage innovation and attract more research funding, in part by increasing research and development funding as government finance allows. Improve training for postgraduate doctors and stop them being used to ""plug gaps"" in staff rotas. More recruitment from within the EU to fill vacancies and using international doctors to staff the NHS while a new generation of Welsh doctors are trained.UKIP: An extra £3bn per year in NHS funding paid for by quitting the EU and through ""middle management"" cuts. Keep NHS free at the point of delivery. Stop any further use of PFI, and encourage local authorities to buy out their PFI contracts early where it is affordable to do so. Ensure all visitors and migrants who have been here for fewer than five years have NHS-approved medical insurance as a condition of entry to UK, with £200m of the £2bn saved to be spent on ending hospital parking charges in England. Bring back state-enrolled nurses and return powers to matrons. Monitor and Care Quality Commission to be replaced with elected county health boards. Stop spending £90m a year on gastric band and breast enhancement operations.Greens: Funding to be diverted away from centralised facilities towards community healthcare, illness prevention and health promotion.  Stop privatisation. Abolish prescription charges. Dedicated NHS Tax to go direct to the health service. Ban proactive recruitment of non-British NHS staff from overseas. A complete ban on the promotion of tobacco and alcohol products, including sponsorship.Security, defence and foreign affairsConservatives: Hold a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU by 2017, after negotiating the return of some powers from Brussels. Protect foreign aid budget. Replace Trident.Labour:  Push for reform of European Union and prevent Britain from ""sleepwalking"" towards exit. Commit in law to holding a Strategic Defence and Security Review every 5 years. Outlaw discrimination and abuse of Armed Forces personnel.Lib Dems: Campaign to reduce the number of Trident nuclear submarines. Push for greater European Union efficiency. SNP: Oppose nuclear weapons and push for removal of Trident submarines from Scotland. In 2010, proposed a Scottish Centre for Reconciliation and Conflict Resolution, to promote peaceful alternatives to armed conflict. Maintain 0.7% commitment to foreign aid. Enhanced role for Scotland within the UK in Europe, particularly in fisheries policy.Plaid Cymru: Honour commitment of 0.7% of budget used for foreign aid. Campaign for cancellation of developing countries' debts. Support the Fair Trade movement. Support the 'Tobin' or 'Robin hood' tax as a means of encouraging more responsibility and stability in the global markets. Reform the IMF and World Bank in order to improve regulation and accountability. Continue membership of the EU, but campaign for democratic reform. Support minority nations and minority language speakers around the world. Pass a Military Wellbeing Act to promote and safeguard the physical and mental health and wellbeing of military personnel.UKIP:  Leave the European Union. Remove the passports of any person who has gone to fight for a terrorist organisation and deport anyone who has committed a terrorist act. Cut foreign aid budget by £9bn. Create a Veterans Department to look after the interests of ex-service men and women.Greens: Referendum on Britain's EU membership. Want reform of EU to hand powers back to local communities. Boost overseas aid to 1% of GDP within 10 years. Scrap Britain's nuclear weapons. Take the UK out of NATO unilaterally. End the so-called ""special relationship"" between the UK and the US.  Stop EU-US free trade deal TTIP. JobsConservatives: Create three million apprenticeships to be paid for by benefit cuts.Labour: Guarantee a job for under 25s unemployed for over a year and adults unemployed for more than two years. As many young people to go on an apprenticeship as currently go to university by 2025. Create a million new high technology, green jobs by 2025. Ban ""exploitative"" zero hour contracts.Lib Dems: An extra £1 an hour for the lowest paid apprentices. Campaign to create a million more jobs.SNP: Introduce gender quotas on public boards. Living wage ""a central priority"" in all Scottish government contracts. Continue the 'small business bonus'.Plaid Cymru: Provide rates relief for small businesses. Increase the number and value of contracts from Welsh public bodies that go to firms within Wales.UKIP: Allow firms to offer jobs to British workers first ""without the fear of being sued for discrimination"".Greens: A national energy conservation scheme to create thousands of new jobs. The party wants to create ""sustainable jobs"" and promotes more local production of food and goods.Education Conservatives: Protect England's schools budget - from reception entry at age four or five to the end of GCSEs at 16 - in cash terms although funding per pupil will not keep pace with inflation. Pre-school and post 16 education not ring fenced. Convert up to 3,500 more schools judged by Ofsted to ""require improvement"" into academies. ""War on illiteracy and innumeracy"". State primary schools in England that repeatedly failed to have a proportion of year-six pupil pass times tables and writing tests be forced to become academies, or have sponsorship replaced if already an academy. Opposed to giving votes to 16 and 17-year-olds for UK-wide general elections and local elections in England.Labour:  Increase the overall education budget in England, including schools, nurseries, Sure Start and provision for 16-to 18-year-olds, by at least the rate of inflation, although per-pupil funding is not specifically protected, meaning some of the increase will be eaten up by rising pupil numbers. Parents of primary school children would be guaranteed childcare from 8am to 6pm. The amount of free childcare for three and four year olds would be increased from 15 to 25 hours a week. Compulsory sex and relationship education in all schools. Refuse to grant business rate relief to independent schools unless they can show a ""meaningful impact"" on state schools through a new School Partnership Standard, for example by lending teaching staff or assisting in university admissions procedures. Committed to extending the franchise to 16 and 17-year-olds in elections across the UK. Double the number of Sure Start childcare places to more than 118,000. Tighten up the rules on primary school class sizes to ensure they do not have more than 30 pupils.Lib Dems: Protect the education budget from cuts. Guarantee qualified teachers and a core curriculum set by independent experts, as well as compulsory sex education, in all state schools including academies and free schools. More money for disadvantaged school children and free childcare for all two year olds. A two-thirds discount on all local bus fares for young people aged 16-21. Supports lowering the voting age to 16 in all UK elections.SNP: Guaranteed free 30 hours of childcare a week for three and four-year-olds in Scotland, up from 16 hours. Maintain lack of tuition fees at Scottish universities, and offer financial support in grants and loans to students. Continue to build and refurbish schools. Lower voting age to 16 in all UK elections.Plaid Cymru: Introduce a compulsory modern foreign language GCSE in secondary schools and the teaching of modern foreign languages in primary schools. Look at ways to strengthen the teaching of Welsh history and culture. Oppose foundation schools, academies and free schools. Look at moving from a per-pupil funding mechanism to a funding model based on the catchment area. Will not support any further increases in tuition fees for higher education students, and will seek the abolition of tuition fees as and when public finances allow. Supports lowering the voting age to 16 for elections to the Welsh Assembly and the UK Parliament.UKIP: More grammar schools. Scrap sex education for children aged under seven. Scrap tuition fees for students from poorer backgrounds who take degree courses in the sciences, technology, maths or engineering. Greater emphasis on vocational education with new Apprenticeship Qualification Option. School governing boards must be made up of at least 30% parents of children at the school. Allow universities to charge same amount for EU students as non-EU students.Greens: End performance related pay for teachers. Replace Ofsted with an independent National Council for Educational Excellence. Bring Free Schools and Academies into local authority control.

Withdraw Jobseeker's Allowance from young people after six months unless they take part in ""community projects"". And 18 to 21-year-olds wouldn't be entitled to housing benefit. Ban on zero-hours contracts which stop people getting work elsewhere. Raise the personal allowance - the point at which you start paying income tax - to £11,000 in April 2016 and then to £12,500 by 2020, which means that if you work on minimum wage for 30 hours you will pay no income tax. Young people out of work, education or training for six months will have to do unpaid community work to get benefits. This will apply to about 50,000 18 to 21-year-olds. Universal benefits for pensioners, such as free bus passes, TV licences for the over 75s and the winter fuel allowance. will once again be protected. Labour: Freeze energy prices until 2017. Increase in the minimum wage from £6.50-an-hour to £8-an-hour by 2020. Rises in child benefit capped at 1% for the first two years of the next parliament. Winter fuel allowance would be withdrawn from the wealthiest pensioners. Repeal what the government calls the spare room subsidy, dubbed the ""bedroom tax"" by Labour.  A million interest-free loans to help people insulate their homes. Rail fares would be capped. Double the amount of paid paternity leave available to new fathers from two to four weeks, and increase statutory paternity pay to £260 a week.Lib Dems: Raise the personal allowance - the point at which you start paying income tax - to £11,000 in April 2016 and then to £12,500 by 2020 (the Conservatives are promising the same thing). Nick Clegg has said he would not accept Conservative plans to freeze working-age benefits without taxing the rich too. He hasn't said he would block welfare cuts altogether. Withdraw eligibility for the Winter Fuel Payment and free TV Licence from pensioners on the 40% rate of income tax. A ""yellow card"" system to deal with benefit claimants breaking the rules, rather than imposing sanctions without warning.SNP: Oppose cuts to in-work benefits. Support moves to extend paternity leave. Introduce a maximum combined withdrawal rate for benefits and reforms to employment support allowance and cold weather payments. Protect policies such as concessionary travel for older Scots.Plaid Cymru: Move away from complex and expensive means testing for child-related benefits. Continue to campaign for the introduction of a living pension during the period of the next parliament for those aged 80 and over. UKIP: Only pay child benefit for the first two children for new claimants. Increase the Carers' Allowance to the same level as Jobseekers' Allowance (JSA) and pay a higher rate of JSA if you've been in work and already made tax and National Insurance contributions. Prevent anyone taking up permanent residence in Britain unless they're able to support themselves and any dependents they bring with them for at least five years and stop them receiving benefits. Stop paying child benefit for children who don't live in Britain. Scrap what UKIP calls the ""detested bedroom tax"". Boost ""credit unions"".Greens: The party backs a Citizen's Income, a fixed amount of £72 income a week to be paid to every individual, whether they are in work or not, to be funded by higher taxes on the better off and green levies.  But in the short-term it would increase the minimum wage to £10 by 2020. Ban zero hours contracts. Axe the ""bedroom tax"". Abolish the work capability assessment and restore the level of the former disability living allowance. Scrap the government's welfare cap, which limits the maximum amount a household can claim annually to £26,000 a year."

2015-04-10,Elephant trap?,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32047998,"The campaign has not even got under way, yet in the space of a couple of hours we have now been treated to not only one election pledge, but to two. The prime minister ruled out raising VAT if re-elected - while Labour said National Insurance contributions wouldn't go up.Usually politicians fudge the question of tax rises.  When he was leader of the opposition David Cameron himself said ""we have no need to raise taxes"" - before hiking up VAT after polling day.Famously, John Major said he had ""no plans"" to put up the sales tax -  before his chancellor did just that.And when he appeared in front of the cross-party Treasury committee of MPs on Tuesday, the current chancellor seemed to be continuing that tradition.  Under repeated questioning, George Osborne said: ""The policies we have do not involve a VAT rise.""That formulation appeared to give him not so much wriggle room, but an entire wriggle mansion.Labour assumed their campaign warning of further VAT rises to come under the Tories was very much on the money.But George Osborne's allies are suggesting privately that he had, in fact, been walking Ed Miliband to the edge of an elephant trap, then beckoning the prime minister to push the opposition leader in.Ed Miliband's strategists fully expected Mr Cameron to repeat the chancellor's obfuscation on tax at the final Prime Minister's Questions of this Parliament. They would then have expanded on the theme, inviting the prime minister to answer other difficult questions - then say he wasn't being straight with the British people for avoiding them.But the Labour leader was completely wrong-footed when first the prime minister said he would rule out a VAT rise and then counter-punched, inquiring if Labour would now rule out an increase in National Insurance contributions.Ed Miliband dodged the question and what could have been downbeat Conservative benches, uneasy over the prime minister's announcement this week of his retirement plans, were given something to cheer.The reason Ed Miliband didn't respond is because he was holding the National Insurance pledge back for Labour's manifesto.But that soon became unsustainable - so the other Ed, the shadow chancellor Ed Balls, had to undertake a hasty round of the TV studios to do just that.When I spoke to him mid-tour, he put on a brave face. His view was that George Osborne, having raised VAT from 17.5% to 20%, wanted to give the issue a low profile - whereas the prime minister had now made the mistake of putting it centre stage. And he believed David Cameron's promise would be judged against his past VAT-raising performance.He defended Ed Miliband's reluctance to talk about National Insurance as he felt it would have been ""inappropriate"" to announce Labour tax policy at PMQs.So the prime minister - always a better tactician than strategist - can at least satisfy himself that he smoked Labour out on NI and disrupted at least one entry in their election campaign grid.But the exchange actually raised more questions than it answered.If the main parties are ruling out further potential sources of revenue, but still committing themselves to eradicating a £90bn black hole in the public finances, will they now be under more pressure during the election campaign to spell out in much greater detail exactly what they intend to cut?"
2015-04-10,Who's next?,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32031343,"David Cameron's declaration that he will not seek a third term in office if he retains power in May has immediately stoked interest in who might fill his shoes when he's gone. Here are the likely - and perhaps less obvious - possibilities.Claim? As chancellor of the exchequer he's the man in charge of the purse strings and master strategist - and reportedly the PM's favourite to succeed him, although he hasn't said as much. Mr Cameron's right-hand man has had an image makeover of late, with a new haircut and a diet to shed some pounds. And he has seemingly recovered from his ""omnishambles"" Budget in 2012, with his latest - and last Budget - of the parliament giving the Tories a lead in some polls. He's said to be well liked among Conservative cabinet ministers and backbench MPs, whose support is vital for any candidate wanting to take on the party leadership. He shas some work to do among grassroots Tory members, however, coming fifth in ConservativeHome's latest online poll of party members on future leaders.Latest odds: 10/1 (according to William Hill)What's he said? ""The prime minister leads a strong team but what you see from him is answering a direct question with a direct answer. I think that's really refreshing. He says he's going to serve that full five years so the real question facing the country now is do you want the strong leadership of David Cameron that's delivering zero inflation and record jobs or do you want the chaos and incompetence of Ed Miliband.""Claim? The longest-serving home secretary in 50 years, she is only the second Conservative woman to secure one of the top four jobs in government. In her role, she has talked tough on immigration and crime and taken on the Police Federation. And she is popular with Tory activists, consistently occupying either first or second place in ConservativeHome's online polls on future party leaders. There have long been claims of Mrs May positioning herself for the top job, with reported tensions between her and the prime minister. Critics say she lacks charisma and micro-manages - while some cannot forget her coining the now infamous ""nasty party"" phrase at a Tory conference in 2002, but supporters say she is a formidable operator, and have dubbed her Britain's Angela Merkel. Latest odds: 9/2What's she said? ""My view is very simple, David Cameron is a first class leader of the party and a first class prime minister and I hope he is going to be doing that for a very long time."" (Desert Island discs, 23 November 2014)Claim? The blonde bombshell and mayor of London who can seemingly reach voters that others in the party cannot. Casting aside a rather chequered past he steered the capital through the 2012 Olympics, launched the successful and popular ""Boris bikes"" and got rid of London's ""bendy buses"" in favour of the new Routemaster double deckers. Mr Johnson hopes to revive his Westminster parliamentary career at the general election. He has been tipped by many to take the helm of the Conservative Party, and has not discouraged the idea. Like Theresa May, he is also a favourite among the grassroots of the party, pipping her to the top spot in ConservativeHome's latest poll of party members on future leaders. (he's ahead by 2 points). Critics say the gaffe-prone politician is not the right man for the job, but his supporters point to his wide-spread appeal.Latest odds: 9/4What's he said? ""I think what David Cameron is saying is banal and obvious. There has already been a leader of the Conservative Party for ten years and he's done an outstanding job. What he's saying now is that he wants to serve through to 2020 and that is frankly what we need him to do... five more years is what this country needs. I'm not entirely certain I see what the story is. He was asked a straight question, are you going to serve a third term like Mrs Thatcher or Tony Blair and he said no, because he thinks that ten years on top of British politics is an incredibly long time.""Claim? A self-made millionaire and devotee of Margaret Thatcher, he is regarded as one of the Conservatives' fastest-rising stars. The Treasury minister-turned-culture secretary became the first of the 2010 intake of MPs to reach cabinet level, and the first Asian male Conservative cabinet minister. He's currently polling well among the Conservative grassroots, who voted him third most preferable leader in ConservativeHome's latest online future leader poll. David Cameron recently said he wants to see a British Asian prime minister in his lifetime.Latest odds: 12/1Claim? Currently holding one of the four great offices of state - foreign secretary - Mr Hammond's name has often cropped up whenever talk of leadership contenders has emerged. He has built up an impressive CV in government since the Conservatives came to power in 2010, being first awarded the job of transport secretary before his promotion to defence secretary where he stayed for three years. He's regarded by many commentators as being a potential candidate for the Tory right. He seems to have work to do among party activists, scoring only 4% in ConservativeHome's future leader poll.Latest odds: 12/1"
2015-04-10,Cereal number,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-magazine-monitor-31962592,"David Cameron has declared he won't seek a third term as prime minister, citing an advertising slogan for Shredded Wheat used in the UK more than 30 years ago. What's its enduring power, asks Justin Parkinson.The hotel kitchen staff are in disbelief. Someone in room 147 has ordered three Shredded Wheat. The maid transports them upstairs to find England cricketer Ian Botham waiting at a table, dressed in full whites.The maid leaves. Botham hides one of the Shredded Wheat under a napkin and winks to camera. Cue music, as the slogan ""Shredded Wheat. Bet you can't eat three"" appears.This advert and others featuring football manager Brian Clough and the actor Richard Kiel, who played Jaws in James Bond films, have not run for some time. Nestle, which owns the brand, says the last probably aired in 1984.But their message seems to have waned little. Telling the BBC he would only serve a limited time in Downing Street, David Cameron said: ""Terms are like Shredded Wheat - two are wonderful but three might just be too many.""The prime minister's reprise was unlikely to be accidental, says Thayne Forbes, joint managing director of the brand-valuation company Intangible Business. ""Everybody would empathise with the view that three Shredded Wheat would probably be too much,"" he says. ""The slogan suggests people shouldn't overdo it. It sounds modest and reasoned.""As marketing goes, it might seem counter-intuitive, as it discourages excessive consumption. But it also sounds honest and unexploitative.Other advertising slogans and themes are in wide use in public and political discourse. Examples include Marmite being a by-word for divisiveness - a ""Marmite person"" is either loved or hated. Cameron has twice referred to Ronseal - the woodcare product that does ""exactly what it says on the tin"". But Shredded Wheat, its best-known slogan having lain dormant for so long, appears to be used less often. The cereal, created in the US in the 1890s, has long been sold as good for the evolving British lifestyle. A newspaper advert in 1902 described it as ""a relief from the monotony of everlasting porridge"", while, by 1943, it was ""an ideal food for all war workers"". The 1980s saw an emphasis on ""simple, honest goodness"", while, in the 2000s, its long heritage and reliability was promoted.""It's a good association for Cameron,"" says Forbes. ""He must have been brought up on it, like lots of other people. It will be great marketing for Shredded Wheat to have the slogan used after so many years, too.""Subscribe to the BBC News Magazine's email newsletter to get articles sent to your inbox"
2015-04-10,Are you 'cosmopolitan'?,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32021853,"The rise of UKIP heralds the emergence of a new divide in British politics, with cosmopolitan voters on one side and non-cosmopolitan ones on the other, argues Jeremy Cliffe.We hear a lot about UKIP these days. The party stole the show at the local and European elections last year, then again in the autumn when it lured two Conservative MPs to defect.  In the past weeks alone there have been three much-discussed television programmes about the party: ""Meet the Ukippers"", ""Farage Fans and UKIP Lovers"" and ""100 Days of UKIP"". At the upcoming general election the party will probably increase its share of seats in Westminster - and will certainly affect the results in dozens of other constituencies by taking votes from the other parties. But ask some of those academics who have been watching UKIP's rise, and they will tell you that it is just one part of a bigger story. We are all used to the left-right divide in politics: a spectrum of different views on how much the government should tax, spend, regulate and otherwise intervene in the economy. But according to Dr Rob Ford of Manchester University, UKIP exists on a different axis, one to do with cultural rather than economic matters. This new political scale is ever more prominent in British political life.Radio 4's Analysis programmeOn the one end of it is what you might call a ""cosmopolitan"" philosophy: a relaxed, liberal attitude to issues concerning national identity (like immigration) and to questions of morality and lifestyle (like gay marriage). On the other end is a ""non-cosmopolitan"" outlook: more nationalist, socially conservative and less comfortable with social change, or in other words the ideological stance often associated with typical UKIP voters. This divide cuts across the left-right scale: there are cosmopolitan and non-cosmopolitan voters in both the Conservative and the Labour camps, which is why UKIP takes support from both.Lots of things are making this cosmopolitanism divide more important. One is that the old class-based, ideological conflict between left and right has declined. Dr James Tilley of Oxford University argues that politicians are partly to blame. The economic philosophies of the Conservative and Labour parties are so similar, he argues, that other, cultural issues are becoming more important. Another factor is the growing gap between the generations: the difference in outlook between the cosmopolitan young and less cosmopolitan, older voters is greater than it was in the past (partly due to the recent rise in levels of university education, which tend to correlate with liberal views). This trend presents the established parties with some difficult questions. As Dr Ford puts it, they ""have to try and deal with this rising value divide, particularly now that UKIP has mobilised it into the political debate."" ""They have to make a move,"" he adds, ""but any move that they make risks making their position worse with one or the other of these groups of voters."" Sound too cosmopolitan, and the parties risk losing supporters to UKIP. Try to ""out-UKIP UKIP"", and they could alienate their younger, more socially liberal supporters. So both are doing the political splits, trying to reconcile the cosmopolitans within their ranks with the non-cosmopolitans. Witness the tortuous attempts by Ed Miliband to sound tough on immigration without sounding too tough. Witness, too, the recent struggles of David Cameron to persuade social conservatives in his party that gay marriage can be an innately conservative institution. In the long-term, this divide will become less problematic. That is because over the years the country will tilt towards the cosmopolitan end of this new spectrum. So says Penny Young of NatCen, the research organisation that conducts the extensive British Social Attitudes survey. Various demographic factors explain this trend. The country as a whole is becoming more accepting of same-sex relationships. Younger voters are more relaxed about things like immigration and national identity than were previous generations when they were young, suggesting that the overall population will tilt in an internationalist direction over time. And ever more parts of the country are acquiring the ethnic and social diversity once confined to the inner cities, a trend that generally makes people more comfortable with immigration. According to Dr Ford the question is therefore: how should the main political parties navigate this period of transition? It would be wrong to simply abandon the swathes of voters at the less cosmopolitan end of the scale; voters who are usually older and more isolated than the average member of the population.Yet the politicians do need to adapt to the changing attitudes of British society and be honest with voters rather than pandering to views that, deep down, they do not share. This quandary may not decide the upcoming general election, but in the established parties savvy strategists with an eye to elections in 2020 and beyond are grappling with it nonetheless. That is a wise move."
2015-04-10,Dudley debate,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32015334,"I met Afzal Amin for the first time on Friday, but I already knew who he was. In Dudley North, the seat he was selected by the Conservatives to fight in the general election, Mr Amin had become hard to avoid. When I first looked at the local newspaper online, the pages were surrounded by ""Amin"" logos in the preferred Tory shade of blue.Not long after we met, he asked me to pose for a photo, snapped by one of his campaign team, and doubtless rapidly tweeted out to followers of the would-be MP.Perhaps no surprise that the man running such a disciplined operation has served in the army and been to Sandhurst. That was very much the message he delivered on Friday, as he addressed school and college pupils at a hustings in Dudley which I'd been invited to chair.There was combative debate, too, not least with his Labour rival, the MP Ian Austin. Both men knew the Dudley contest was critical for their respective parties; Ian Austin held the seat by just over 600 votes in 2010. Just as David Cameron was denied a majority by failing to take seats like this one, so Ed Miliband is unlikely to be in No 10 if Labour loses Dudley North.He was self-confident and fluent. The only obvious mis-step came right at the end, when he interrupted Vicky Duckworth, the Green candidate for the neighbouring seat. She expressed the opinion that politics often seemed to be about men shouting at each other; Mr Amin complained she was engaging in gender bias.A few weeks ago, one Conservative MP who knows him well and respects his talents, said Afzal Amin had warned him of the risks of over-confidence. He thought he risked running before he could walk.Well, he stumbled badly this weekend. Whatever the purpose of his contacts with the English Defence League - and he strongly disputes claims that he wanted them to hold a protest that would then be called off, for which he could then take the credit - the exposure has damaged him and, potentially, the prospects of his party re-taking the seat.In February, the EDL staged a rally against plans for a new mosque in the town. As the Mail on Sunday story makes clear, Afzal Amin pleaded with them beforehand not to hold that demonstration; but it went ahead anyway. It's what happened subsequently which will feature in Tuesday's disciplinary hearing.Over the weekend, I put his defence to a very senior Conservative source - that this was an attempt to broker a compromise in order to bring together a divided community. The arch response: Dudley isn't Kandahar.Nor do I think from my visits to the town, where I'm going to be based for the general election, will people in Dudley appreciate being painted as somewhere riven by racial discord.True, Dudley was the scene of one of England's earliest race riots. But that was in 1962. Although the controversy over replacing the mosque - currently in a converted school and inadequate for the numbers who want to worship there - has been running for a decade, community relations are generally good. Even those who don't want a new mosque didn't want the EDL protestors - nor to be fair the anti-fascist counter-demonstrators who followed them.As for the Conservative Party, the view of the national leadership is that you don't collaborate with the EDL. Not least because the Tories are still struggling to bury some historic baggage in the Black Country: Enoch Powell was an MP in Wolverhampton when he delivered his Rivers of Blood speech about immigration in 1968.Four years before that, there was the notorious election in Smethwick which the Conservatives were accused of winning by wooing white voters with an offensive rhyme suggesting who'd they'd get as a neighbour if they voted Labour. Afzal Amin grew up in Smethwick so he should be aware of that history. He was, until his suspension on Saturday, one of about 17% of Conservative parliamentary candidates who are not white. The party is proud of that, but it's still struggling to translate that into votes.Afzal Amin may believe that he can persuade the party to lift the suspension when he meets party officials on Tuesday. I have my doubts. Even if they accept his defence, will the other parties be so charitable? The allegations would follow him on the campaign trail, and make planned visits by cabinet ministers next to impossible.On Friday, just before the hustings in Dudley began, Afzal Amin gave me his business card. It introduces him as 'prospective member of Parliament Dudley North'. I think I'll keep it; it could yet become a collector's item."

2015-04-11,Bid to change Speaker election rules,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32061097,"A last-minute bid to change the way the Speaker of the House of Commons is elected is to be debated by MPs.Labour criticised the government motion, to be debated on the final day before the dissolution of Parliament, saying the Conservatives were ""trying to play politics with the speakership"".Under the proposals, a secret ballot would decide whether there should be a contested election for the post.MPs currently have to file through the division lobbies to cast their vote.This means it is clear who does or does not back the incumbent as Speaker.Labour's shadow leader of the Commons Angela Eagle raised the party's concerns in the House on Wednesday evening, questioning whether the motion was within parliamentary rules.Current Speaker John Bercow is - technically - one of them, but many Tory MPs have never liked him.They resent his personal style and some believe he is far from impartial in the way he conducts business in the Commons.Attempts by some to force a vote on his resumption as Speaker in 2010 came to nothing. There have been the occasional measured jibes at him from the prime minister. Other Tories reportedly went much further and formed a group whose members had all been reprimanded by him. But the Speaker is a reformer who believes passionately that the people who elect the members, and pay the bills, should come first.The last act of the coalition looks like being an attempt to unseat him. And they are very serious about it.One Tory MP fighting an important marginal seat had been cleared by his party to be away from Parliament but he is now staying for the vote, such is the importance of it.She told Deputy Speaker Lindsay Hoyle: ""It's just come to my attention that the government has tabled a motion for debate on the final day of this Parliament, with no notice whatsoever to myself as shadow leader of the House, proposing changes to the way in which the Speaker of this House is elected.""Procedural matters in this House, with no consultation with the opposition, no consultation with the chair of the committee itself, for debate in only one hour tomorrow.""Mr Hoyle said the motion had been ""rightly or wrongly"" agreed to on Tuesday, saying that ""business of the House is decided by the government, not by the chair.""A spokesman for Commons Leader William Hague said the motion had been tabled as a free hour had opened up in Thursday's business after the House of Lords approved the Modern Slavery Bill.The proposed change would apply when a Speaker wishes to continue in the post after a general election.Under the current rules, if the Speaker's re-appointment is objected to, a division is held, with MPs choosing to back or oppose the Speaker in the division lobbies.The replacement of this method with a secret ballot was suggested in 2010 by a committee of MPs, which said the public method ""can be seen as a deterrent to the House expressing its views honestly"".MPs will now debate whether this change should be made."

2015-04-11,MPs warn on growth of UK jihadists,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32059813,"Not enough is being done to prevent people leaving the UK to join Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, a group of MPs has warned.Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said Britain must win their ""hearts and minds"".The committee's report comes as the BBC launches a database tracking British jihadists in Syria and Iraq. It shows that many people left in clusters from certain UK areas - often due to friendships and peer groups. The MPs' report argued that preventative work with communities, families and international partners was ""vital"" and needs to be a top priority for the Home Office.  ""The number of cases being brought to public attention should ring alarm bells,"" said Labour MP Mr Vaz.  ""This must be a relentless battle for hearts and minds, and without a strong counter-narrative we are in danger of failing to prevent even more departures. We are at the edge of a cliff."" The BBC has been tracking the stories of the men, women, boys and girls who have gone to Syria and Iraq to understand why they go, where they go from and what happens to them. By analysing around 160 profiles, it reveals the way in which people have travelled in clusters - a group of three young friends from Coventry, another group from Portsmouth, drawn out by one person they knew, others in Cardiff linked to people involved in an extremist organisation. Social media might play a part but face-to-face contact appears just as, if not more, important, according to the database.It includes the stories of: The BBC research emphasises the extent to which real-world contacts, rather than just online connections, are often a key driver of radicalisation and intent to travel to Iraq and Syria. Some of the experts who appeared before the Home Affairs Committee also argued the internet was a secondary influence. They said that universities and prisons were among the two most significant places where radicalisation occurred. A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police, which was not aware of the report, said it would have ""welcomed the opportunity"" to have given evidence to the committee and that it planned to look at the report in detail.The disappearance of schoolgirls Shamima Begum, Amira Abase, both 15, and Kadiza Sultana, 16, from east London in February, raised questions as to who could have done more to prevent their departure. After taking evidence from the police and the families of the girls among others, Mr Vaz said their case suffered from a ""lack of immediate action"". He added: ""Schools and the police must inform parents immediately, and work with them even if there is the smallest hint of radicalisation, or a close association with someone who is thought to have been radicalised.""However, the Met Police spokesman defended the speed of the police response to the schoolgirls' disappearance.  He said the committee's criticism was ""misleading"", pointing to the evidence given by both UK and Turkish authorities of ""rapid exchanges"" between the two.The committee's report said there needed to be an advice service which would be a less extreme step than calling the anti-terrorist hotline.The Association of Chief Police Officer's lead officer for the government's anti-terror strategy Prevent, Chief Constable Sir Peter Fahy, agreed that more needed to be done.However, he said the police ""do not have the capacity"" to routinely work with every school in the country.He added: ""The police service will play its part but the prime responsibility for dissuading young people from getting involved in extremist activity has to lie with parents, families and carers.""The committee also pointed to weaknesses in information sharing with airlines and other countries. It said greater care needed to be taken at airport check-in desks when people were travelling to destinations of concern - namely Syria, Somalia, Iraq and Nigeria, as well as neighbouring countries, such as Turkey. The report said police also needed to work faster to alert overseas partners and airlines when there were concerns over individuals.There were signs that some of the girls had followed extremist accounts on social media, the report said.The committee said that social media companies, such as Facebook and Twitter, should be prepared to suspend accounts when there is evidence they are being used to promote violent extremism.  The report also said it was disappointed the Home Office had not implemented a programme for individuals returning to Britain where there is evidence they had fought in Syria.Security officials estimate that some 600 Britons have left the country to join IS - and while around half may have returned, many are still out there - and some have died.  The BBC project includes detailed profiles of individuals which can be searched, based on hometown, age and gender, as well as those who have been convicted in the courts or who are believed to have been killed."

If not, the prince's private letters will either remain confidential, as the sender intended, or they'll be exposed to a large and inquisitive audience.

That will be a clear pledge from us.""He accused Mr Cameron of making an ""out of the blue, panicky"" announcement on VAT that ""no one in Britain will believe"".Labour, which has already announced plans to increase the top rate of income tax and impose a new ""mansion tax"" on high value properties, insists its plans are fully costed and will not require additional tax hikes if it wins May's general election.Mr Miliband began his final head-to-head encounter with Mr Cameron before the election by joking that the PM had ""announced his retirement plans"" - a reference to a BBC interview in which the prime minister said he would not serve a third term if the Tories remained in power.Challenging Mr Cameron to give a ""straight answer to a straight question"", Mr Miliband pressed him on whether he would rule out a rise in VAT after the election, as Labour had done.In response, the prime minister immediately said ""yes"", prompting loud cheers in turn from the Conservative benches. He contrasted what he said was a ""clear promise"" with Labour's unwillingness to rule out a rise in National Insurance.""I answered a very simple question about VAT. I ruled out an increase... straight answer to him, straight question from me. I have ruled out VAT. Will he rule out national insurance contributions. Yes or no?"" Mr Cameron added: ""We all know this is Labour's job tax. This is their tax of choice. This is what they clobber working people, families and enterprises with.""But Mr Miliband responded by saying there was ""only one person who is going to raise taxes on working families and that is him"".He said nobody would believe Mr Cameron on VAT ""because of his extreme spending plans, because his numbers do not add up and because he promised it last time and broke his promise"".Mr Cameron, he added, had broken other promises made before the last election to reduce annual net migration below 100,000 and not to pursue a major structural re-organisation of the NHS, adding that it was ""time for a better plan and time for a Labour government"".But Mr Cameron suggested a future Labour government would result in the ""chaos of economic crisis"", with Ed Miliband being ""held hostage"" by the SNP.The packed session provided a last opportunity for the two men to rally their MPs and set out their arguments before the start of the election campaign next week.Speaking after the exchanges and the other parties' tax pledges, deputy prime minister Nick Clegg said the Lib Dems ""don't need to raise VAT, national insurance or headline rates of income tax or corporation tax either"".""There are other taxes and other tax loopholes that we can increase or close in order to balance the books,"" he said.

2015-04-11,Met police 'had files on MPs in 90s',https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32044580,"A former undercover police officer has told BBC News that Scotland Yard kept intelligence files on MPs during the 1990s. Ex-Special Branch officer Peter Francis says he saw files on 10 Labour MPs which he and others regularly updated. He says he personally gathered information on three MPs as part of his work infiltrating left-wing groups. The MPs named, and Labour, have called for a forthcoming public inquiry into undercover policing to be widened. Mr Francis operated undercover between 1993 and 1997 in the Met's now disbanded Special Demonstration Squad. He was told to embed himself in left-wing groups or causes that were deemed to pose a potential threat to security. He says that during this period he was told to gather intelligence on MPs and their activities if and when they featured in any of his operations. That information, he says, was added to a special pink file that was available for Special Branch officers to read. Between 1990 and 2001, he claims to have personally seen records relating to Diane Abbott, the late Tony Benn, Jeremy Corbyn, the late Bernie Grant, Peter Hain, Harriet Harman, Ken Livingstone, Joan Ruddock, Dennis Skinner and Jack Straw.Four of the group became ministers during Mr Francis's time in Special Branch - including Jack Straw who was home secretary after 1997. ""When I was deployed undercover in the Special Demonstration Squad, any MP that I came across, such as on demonstrations, I would report back on them,"" he said. Mr Francis says that the files not only contained the MPs' publicly-stated political views - but also intelligence on what was going on behind the scenes in the party or their group. He says some of the information would have been things said in private by the MP, depending on how close each undercover officer had been able to get. Mr Francis said that when he first saw the files he understood that each had probably been created before the individual was an MP because of their personal involvement in radical causes or protests.But he added: ""When they became MPs these files carried on. It [was] your duty as an SDS officer to report back any intelligence that you come across. ""I felt that it was OK to report back on MPs,"" he said. ""I used to give myself a pat on the back, thinking 'I have done a good job'. These MPs were spied on and they should know.""""I don't think the police force should be monitoring MPs, full stop. I don't think we have any right to do that at all. It may be justifiable to say that the Security Service should be doing it - but I certainly don't think the police should be doing it.""Scotland Yard has refused to comment on the substance of the claims, but a spokesman said it had not shied away from serious allegations about the SDS. It said that Operation Herne, the internal police investigation into what happened in the unit, remained an ongoing investigation.""Operation Herne maintains that without speaking to Peter Francis it is simply not possible to fully investigate allegations he makes,"" said a spokesman. ""Operation Herne remains very willing to engage with him.""Mr Francis said that he has refused to speak to Operation Herne because he fears being interviewed under caution as a suspect, rather than a whistleblower. Scotland Yard told the BBC that Operation Herne detectives would be prepared to speak to him as a witness. He has, however, spoken to Mark Ellison QC who reviewed allegations about the SDS for the Home Secretary Theresa May - prompting her to launch a statutory inquiry. He says he will appear before those hearings. Peter Hain, who was a leader of the anti-apartheid movement in the late 1960s and 70s and became an MP in 1991, said he now wants full answers from Scotland Yard. ""I was deeply disturbed to find that files were still being kept by the Special Branch while I and others were serving Members of Parliament,"" he said. ""That is constitutionally an outrage. It infringes the sovereignty of Parliament. ""I want to see the home secretary widen the scope of the inquiry into the SDS to look specifically at the surveillance of MPs and the fact that there were active files on us while we were serving Members of Parliament. ""This should never have happened and it should have been reported and properly authorised - and we don't know whether it was.""Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper echoed the call for the inquiry to be widened in light of what she described as ""extremely serious and disturbing allegations"".""While undercover policing remains a crucial tool in combating serious and organised crime it must not be abused,"" she said.""There have now been a series of serious allegations about undercover policing - ranging from the treatment of Stephen Lawrence's family to police having long-term inappropriate relationships. ""We called some time ago for much stronger oversight of undercover policing and it is also vital to get to the truth about what has happened."" Mrs May announced earlier this month that Lord Justice Pitchford would lead the inquiry into the SDS allegations - but the precise shape of that inquiry is not yet clear.A Home Office spokesman said the review by Mark Ellison QC had unearthed ""serious historical failings"". ""That is why the Home Secretary established a public inquiry to thoroughly investigate undercover policing and the operation of the Special Demonstration Squad. ""Lord Justice Pitchford will consult interested parties to the inquiry over the coming months on setting the terms of reference, with a view to publishing these at the end of July.""Undercover policing is an essential tactic in the fight against crime but to improve the public's confidence in undercover work we must ensure there is no repeat of these failings in the future."""
2015-04-11,NHS problems worst 'since 1990s',https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/health-32057948,"Services in the NHS in England are deteriorating in a way not seen since the early 1990s, according to a leading health think tank. The King's Fund review said waiting times for A&E, cancer care and routine operations had all started getting worse, while deficits were growing.It said such drops in performance had not been seen for 20 years.But the think tank acknowledged the NHS had done as well as could be expected, given the financial climate.Professor John Appleby, chief economist at the King's Fund, which specialises in health care policy, said: ""The next government will inherit a health service that has run out of money and is operating at the very edge of its limits. ""There is now a real risk that patient care will deteriorate as service and financial pressures become overwhelming.""He said in terms of how standards were slipping - not how low they had reached - the situation was the worst it had been since the ""early 1990s"".The report noted much of the deterioration has happened in the second-half of the Parliament with many measures of performance being maintained in the first few years.It said the next government had to address the funding situation, adding the extra £8bn a year NHS England says is needed by 2020, was the ""minimum"" that would be required.The report - a review of performance this Parliament - highlights a range of problems as well as achievements. These include:The report is the second part of the King's Fund pre-election review of the NHS this Parliament.Last month it warned the coalition government's reforms of the health service had been ""damaging and distracting"".The King's Fund report should make worrying reading. The reference to the 1990s conjures up images of - for the NHS at least - a bygone era. The think tank's point was not that waiting times had reached the level they were at then, rather that this is the first time in two decades of almost continuous improvement that there has been a sustained drop in performance.In many ways, that had to happen. Services cannot keep getting better for ever. Nonetheless, the findings are crystal clear: the NHS is at a critical juncture. But what is less easy to determine is to what extent the coalition's policies have contributed to the difficulties.The think tank has already provided a critical analysis of the government's reforms - and when pushed, acknowledged the health service may have been ""in better shape"" if they had not happened.But the more significant issue for the health of the health service this Parliament has been the squeeze on finances. Even though the budget has been increased, it has felt more like a cut to many because demands have risen so quickly.On this though, the King's Fund accepted that the government's hands were tied. Given the state of the economy, ministers did as much as they could have.Read more from NickRoyal College of Nursing general secretary Peter Carter said politicians needed to take note of the warnings made by the King's Fund.""Morale is low, and more and more staff are being made sick with stress because of the intolerable pressure they are under,"" he added. Katherine Murphy, of the Patients Association, said: ""The findings echo what we are hearing on a daily basis on our helpline. It is clear to the public that the future of the NHS is one of the most important issues facing the nation and it should be a central issue in the election campaign.""Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham said: ""Five years ago David Cameron stood on a promise to protect the NHS. This report provides authoritative proof that he has broken that promise.""But a Department of Health spokesman said: ""As the King's Fund says, the NHS has 'performed well in the face of huge challenges', but if we are to continue to invest in the NHS going forward it needs to be backed by a strong economy.""

2015-04-11,SNP 'could block Tory government',https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32045419,"The SNP would block a minority Conservative government by voting down its Queen's Speech if it holds the post-election balance of power, its former leader Alex Salmond has said.Mr Salmond said the move could bring down the government if Labour joined in, with David Cameron ""locked out"".The Conservatives accused him of ""trying to sabotage the democratic will of the British people"".Labour has called his balance of power prediction ""bluster and bluff"".In recent days Mr Salmond, who is bidding to become a Westminster MP at the 7 May general election, has claimed his party could ""hold the power"" in a hung Parliament and would be able to influence the Budget of a minority Labour government.This was dismissed by Labour leader Ed Miliband, who has ruled out a formal coalition with the Scottish nationalists.The SNP currently has six MPs at Westminster, but recent opinion polls suggest its share could increase dramatically at the general election.James Cook, BBC News Scotland correspondentIf the Conservatives attempt to form a minority government and enough MPs vote against their Queen's Speech the administration would fall at the first hurdle and the leader of the opposition would have a shot at forming a government.That's how parliamentary democracy works in the event of a hung Parliament.And yet the Conservatives are saying that by planning to vote against a government he opposes Alex Salmond has ""confirmed he would sabotage the democratic will of the British people in order to make Ed Miliband prime minister"".It is part of their continuing attempt to portray Mr Miliband as a weak leader whose strings are being pulled by Mr Salmond.This kind of language causes despair among Tories north of the border who fear that the party in London is waltzing into an SNP trap.They know that many voters in Scotland will read the phrase ""democratic will of the British people"" and hear ""democratic will of the English people"".Because, if it is illegitimate for Scottish MPs, from whatever party, to vote against one government and support another in the British parliament, then what, voters may ask, is the point of the union?Who is dancing to Mr Salmond's tune now?Mr Salmond, the former Scottish first minister, told the New Statesman that in the event of a hung Parliament, a minority Conservative government would have to ""go straight effectively for a vote of confidence - usually the Queen's Speech, although it could be otherwise, of course - and we'd be voting against.""If David Cameron lost this vote, he said, there would be a two-week period for another government to be formed.BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said Mr Salmond had ""hardened his anti-Conservative rhetoric"" in the interview.A Conservative spokesman said:  ""Alex Salmond has confirmed he would sabotage the democratic will of the British people in order to make Ed Miliband prime minister. ""That would mean chaos for Britain, with weak Ed Miliband dancing to Alex Salmond's tune.""He said the ""only way to keep Britain together"" was to vote Conservative.Mr Salmond's latest comments come after Mr Miliband said the only people writing a future Labour Budget would be himself and shadow chancellor Ed Balls.Speaking in Clydebank on Monday, he added: ""It's not going to be Alex Salmond - not in a million years."""
2015-04-11,MPs criticise 'lack of EU debate',https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32045290,"The government's ""failure"" to let MPs debate EU legislation is ""deplorable"", a Parliamentary committee says.The European Scrutiny Committee said ministers had refused to schedule debates on issues such as free movement and the EU's Budget.It also said BBC coverage of EU matters should be ""improved substantially"".The government said the number of EU debates had doubled since 2009-10, while the BBC said its coverage was ""extensive and impartial"".The cross-party committee's role includes scrutinising EU documents and recommending the most important for debate in the House of Commons.Its report said in the period covering most of the 2014-15 financial year there were three debates on the floor of the House, compared with 12 in 2013-14.It also pointed out that not a single debate had taken place during a nine-month period, between 9 June 2014 and 9 March 2015.""The government's collective failure to schedule so many debates on EU documents over the past year is deplorable, and is a discourtesy to this committee and to all members of the House,"" the MPs said.Prime Minister David Cameron has sought to rally support from other EU leaders for his plans to curb welfare payments to European migrants ahead of a referendum on the UK's membership if he wins the general election.The committee said the government's ""cavalier"" approach was ""at odds with UK ministers' claims in their speeches across the EU about the role of national parliaments"".The Foreign Office said the government was committed to a ""strong EU scrutiny system that enables Parliament to hold it to account for the decisions taken in Brussels"".It added: ""We have made good on our commitment to raise standards by doubling the number of Europe debates on the floor of the House since 2009-10.""This government has also increased by around a fifth since 2010 the number of EU proposals that have been scrutinised and cleared by Parliament before being agreed in Brussels.""The committee has also been examining the BBC's coverage of European issues, taking evidence from director general Lord Hall and head of news James Harding earlier this month.During that appearance, Lord Hall said the desire for balanced output ""ran deep"" within the BBC and he believed that this was being achieved.Mr Harding said if the public was going to trust the BBC to report on politicians impartially it had to be clear that BBC journalists weren't ""asked by politicians to come and account for what they do and in effect do the bidding of those politicians"".But the committee said it was ""concerned about the manner in which the BBC treats EU issues"", calling for coverage to be ""improved substantially"".It suggested coverage did not reflect all sides of the debate on the European Union, and more analysis was needed. Its chairman, Conservative MP Sir William Cash, said the BBC had ""very particular obligations"" to be impartial and to ""educate and inform"".He added:  ""We do not believe this is currently being achieved in the context of the BBC's EU coverage.""A BBC spokesman said the corporation provided extensive and impartial coverage of European and Parliamentary issues, and it would be a breach of the corporation's independence if a committee of MPs instructed the BBC on its coverage."
2015-04-11,Lobbyists must 'conform' with rules,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32047992,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe woman in charge of the government's new register of lobbyists has said she expects the industry to ""conform"" with the statutory system. Speaking ahead of the register's launch, Alison White conceded a lot of lobbyists would not be listed on it.But she said her job was to make sure the rules were implemented and she would do so with ""extreme verve and vigour.""But one critic of the register said it was ""fake"" and full of ""loopholes"".Lobbyists are companies or individuals paid to influence government decisions.The coalition promised to introduce a statutory register of lobbyists when it came to power in 2010, and legislation was passed last year, with ministers saying the move would help clean up politics.However, the new register will only cover consultant lobbyists and will not apply to lobbyists working ""in-house"" for companies or organisations.A person or company will only need to be registered if they are contacting a government minister or permanent secretary in a government department - leading to criticism it will not come close to reflecting the scale or nature of lobbying that goes on across Whitehall.But Ms White, who is independent of the government, said her task was to implement the law as it stood not to question the powers she had been given. ""We are having something that has never been in place before,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""This is a statutory register. The industry tells me it is a professional industry. I expect them to conform with the legislation. It is my job to make sure they do so.""Ms White, who was appointed as the registrar of consultant lobbyists in September, acknowledged the register would not indicate different ""levels of lobbying"".""The legislation was quite narrowly drafted to address a particular issue, which was that it was not always particularly clear, when ministers were being lobbied, who the client of the lobbyist was. That is what the register was set up to do,"" she said.She added: ""This will give anyone who wishes to access the register the opportunity to be able to see who is lobbying and being paid for it and who their clients are. That is the main information the register will contain.""If a lobbyist sets out to influence government policy in some way, they would have to be registered. If they are not registered, then they would not be conforming. They have to go on the register before they lobby.""Ms White said last month that the register would not have any entries on its launch day but she had received more than ""20 expressions of interest"" about joining and companies and individuals might be required to sign up retrospectively.Potential registrants will be able to log on and create an account to file an ""information return"".But Tamasin Cave, from the Alliance for Lobbying Transparency coalition, said ""hardly anyone"" in the industry would be covered by the provisions of the new law. ""You have a huge commercial lobbying industry, and very few of them will have to sign up,"" she told Today.""The second flaw is that it won't show the interaction between lobbyists and government, and that is what a register is for.""It is to show the activity - who is discussing what with whom, but this shows nothing of this interaction. It is a fake register."""
2015-04-11,Car smoking ban MSP welcomes backing,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-south-scotland-32055226,"The Liberal Democrat MSP behind a bill to ban smoking in cars when children are present has welcomed the support of the Scottish government.South of Scotland MSP Jim Hume launched the members' bill in December.The government said it was ""very supportive"" of the principles of the bill, but changes could be needed to make it ""workable"".Motorists could potentially be fined £100 for breaching the rule if it becomes law.Mr Hume lodged draft proposals for a bill last May calling for a ban in Scotland on smoking in private vehicles when children under 18 were present.He said he was ""over the moon"" at the news the Scottish government would endorse the Smoking Prohibition (Children in Motor Vehicles) (Scotland) Bill.He said: ""With cross-party support and the support of many third sector organisations, there is every chance that this could be in place in the next year.""Eighty-four per cent of the 160 responses to my consultation were positive and people from across Scotland have expressed their support for the move.""The bill is about guaranteeing that children in Scotland can have the freedom to go on and lead healthy lives if they choose to.""I look forward to working with MSPs from all parties as the bill progresses.""Public Health Minister Maureen Watt said the Scottish government had considered including the measure in its Public Health Bill, but instead decided to support Mr Hume's proposals.She said: ""As with any bill, as it goes through the scrutiny process, there may be amendments and improvements to strengthen the legislation and ensure it is fit for purpose. ""But we believe that the underpinning principles are strong, and that is why I am pleased to support it.""Scottish Labour and a wide range of health organisations have backed his proposals.But the Scottish Conservatives have reservations about how the bill would work in practice.The party's health spokesman Jackson Carlaw said: ""While Scottish Conservatives support any moves which would protect young people from hazardous second hand smoke we have concerns as to how this would be enforced.""It would be a better use of resources to conduct a public awareness campaign similar to that which is being proposed by the government in Wales.""We will be watching this campaign in order to ascertain what lessons may be learned and what approaches may be adopted in Scotland.""Anti-smoking campaigners welcomed the Scottish government's backing for Mr Hume's bill.ASH Scotland's chief executive Sheila Duffy said: ""It is another public health initiative that can help Scotland move forward with its ambition to achieve a tobacco-free generation in 20 years' time.""It is popular with the public and will bring Scotland into line with upcoming legislation in England and Wales.""We believe it can be effectively enforced and that having the legislation focus on cars with children bypasses concerns over interference in people's private lives.""Jim Hume must be congratulated for taking the initiative on this proposal and for all the hard work he and his team have done to bring this important measure forward.""But Simon Clark, director of the smokers' group Forest, said the bill was ""legislation for legislation's sake"".He said: ""Smoking in cars carrying children is inconsiderate. The overwhelming majority of smokers know that and don't do it.""The very small number that do will carry on regardless because the law will be difficult, if not impossible, to enforce.""Education has to be better than legislation but the government prefers gesture politics and the big stick."""
2015-04-11,Candidate quits over UKIP MEP remark,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32038485,"A UKIP election candidate has quit the party over comments made by the party's only Scottish MEP about a Scottish government minister.Tim Wilson has decided not to stand in South Northamptonshire after David Coburn MEP compared Humza Yousaf to convicted terrorist Abu Hamza.Mr Coburn has apologised for the remarks, saying it was a ""joke"".A spokesman for UKIP said Mr Wilson had failed to emphasise local issues in his general election campaign.UKIP leader Nigel Farage said Mr Coburn's remarks were a ""joke in poor taste"" but he would not be taking any action against him.But Mr Wilson said he was disillusioned with the party over the ""racist jibes"" and has decided to stand down.He told BBC Scotland he was appalled by Mr Coburn's comments about Mr Yousaf and frustrated by the inaction of the party's leadership on the issue.  He said David Coburn had produced ""what I can only describe as an Islamaphobic insult, and that's simply not acceptable"".  Mr Wilson added: ""Of course he went on and apologised.  I think, frankly, that if you are in a position of power you have to be able to control what ideas emerge from your head and how they get to your mouth and, in fact, you shouldn't have those ideas in the first place.  ""But the real issue is that when Mr Farage was asked what he thought about this he dismissed this as a joke.  ""I don't think this is a joke. I think this is something very serious.  It may not be that this man intended to cause offence but we aren't interested in what his intentions are.  We are interested in the effect what he says has on other people and the effect is catastrophic, it's appalling and I've resigned.""In his resignation letter, Mr Wilson said he had been ""systematically gagged by the party whip"" and forbidden to speak about Islam favourably. A spokesman for UKIP said Mr Wilson had failed to put more emphasis on local issues in his campaign.He said: ""Whilst we had initially been optimistic about Tim Wilson's abilities as a candidate, it became obvious in recent weeks that he was out of his depth in representing our party in the way we would expect. ""Mr Wilson had clearly misunderstood the expectations that UKIP place on all of its candidates. Principal amongst those is focusing on issues that are relevant to local voters. UKIP put huge emphasis on local issues and Mr Wilson was unwilling to follow UKIP guidelines in this respect.""Last week MSPs at the Scottish Parliament unanimously condemned the remarks made by Mr Coburn during a newspaper interview.MSPs were debating a motion celebrating Scotland's diverse communities.The president of the European Parliament, Martin Schulz, condemned the remarks, saying they were ""not worthy of any elected member"". But a spokesman for the president said he could not act on remarks made outside parliament.The move comes just days after another candidate, Jonathan Stanley, quit in protest at the ""racist filth"" in UKIP. Mr Stanley, who was due to stand in the Cumbrian seat of Westmorland and Lonsdale, was the party's former head of policy in Scotland."

2015-04-11,Manifesto watch,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-29642613,"Political parties are putting together their manifestos for May's general election. Here's a guide to where they currently stand on the issues voters say they care about most (according to pollsters IPSOS Mori).ImmigrationConservatives:  David Cameron wants to make migrants wait four years before they can claim certain benefits, such as tax credits, Universal Credit, or get access to social housing. He wants to stop migrants from claiming child benefit for dependents living outside the UK, and remove those that have failed to find work after six months. Mr Cameron has promised to put reform of EU free movement rules at the heart of his renegotiation of Britain's relationship with the EU. He has ruled out a temporary cap on migrant numbers or an ""emergency brake"" on EU freedom of movement rules - ideas both mooted in recent months, saying this would be less ""effective"" than reducing the incentives for people to come to the UK. The party has a continuing goal to bring net immigration down to below 100,000 people a year (it currently stands at 243,000).Labour: ""Stronger"" border controls to tackle illegal immigration with ""proper"" entry and exit checks. ""Smarter"" targets to reduce low-skilled migration but ensure university students and high-skilled workers are not deterred. Employment agencies who only recruit abroad will be outlawed while the fines for employing illegal immigrants will be increased.Lib Dems: Reintroduce exit checks at borders, so the government can identify people who are overstaying their visa. Will require all new claimants for Jobseekers Allowance to have their English language skills assessed, with JSA then being conditional on attending language courses for those whose English is poor. Ensure that EU migrants have to ""earn"" their entitlement to benefits.SNP: Allow the devolved government to have control over immigration to Scotland, and introduce a Canadian-style earned citizenship system to attract highly-skilled immigrants.Plaid Cymru: Oppose a points-based system. Support the right of asylum seekers to work in Wales while they wait for status decisions to be made. Lobby the Westminster government to ensure that they shut ""detention"" centres.UKIP: Introduce an Australian-style points policy, used to select migrants with the skills and attributes needed to work in the country - covering people from inside and outside the EU. Bring net immigration down to 50,000 people a year. Priority lanes for UK passport holders. Increase UK border staff by 2,500. Tougher English language tests for migrants seeking permanent residence. Opt out of the Dublin treaty to allow the UK to return asylum seekers to other EU countries without considering their claim. Anyone who currently has the legal right to live, work, or study in the UK would not face deportation in the event of the country's withdrawal from the EU.Greens:  Progressively reduce UK immigration controls. Migrants illegally in the UK for over five years will be allowed to remain unless they pose a serious danger to public safety. More legal rights for asylum seekers.Taxes and the economyConservatives: Eradicate the deficit by 2018 and secure an overall budget surplus by 2019-20. Achieve this by spending cuts, not tax rises, while raising NHS spending. An income tax cut for 30 million people by 2020. Tax would start to kick in at £12,500 a year, instead of £10,500. This will cost £5.6bn. The higher tax rate, 40%, would start at £50,000 instead of £41,900, again by 2020, at a cost of £1.6bn. This will be paid for through £25bn in additional spending cuts and economic growth. No increases in VAT.Labour: Get the current budget into surplus and the national debt falling ""as soon as possible in the next parliament"". No additional borrowing for new spending. Reintroduce the 50p top rate of income tax for earnings over £150,000.  Cut income tax for 24 million people by bringing back the 10p rate, paid for by scrapping the Married Couples' Tax Allowance. Bring in a ""mansion tax"" on properties worth over £2m, to raise £1.2bn. A tax on bankers' bonuses. A 5% pay cut for every government minister. Push for UK overseas territories to be put on an international blacklist if they refuse to co-operate with a drive against tax avoidance. No increases in VAT or National Insurance contributions.Lib Dems: Raise the personal allowance - the point at which you start paying income tax - to £11,000 in April 2016 and then to £12,500 by 2020. ""Strict new fiscal rules"" to ensure the deficit has gone by April 2018, with the wealthy contributing the most. The Lib Dems invented the ""mansion tax"" but in contrast to Labour have set out how it would operate - along similar lines to council tax bands. There are also Lib Dem plans to increase capital gains tax - paid on profits from second homes or shares - from 28% to 35%. Impose an additional 8% rate of corporation tax on UK banks to raise an extra £1bn a year to help pay off the deficit.SNP: Oppose UK plans in the Infrastructure Bill which will allow oil and gas drilling and hydraulic fracturing beneath people's homes without consent. Invest in offshore wind farming. Support an international bank tax and limits to industry bonuses.Plaid Cymru: Build a Green Skills Construction College, specialising in green energy. Establish a publicly-owned energy company. Establish a publicly-owned Bank of Wales business investment bank. Enforce a living wage. Give devolved nations an equal say in institutions that affect everyone's lives, such as the Bank of England.UKIP: Increase the personal allowance to the level of full-time minimum wage earnings, about £13,500, by 2020. Abolish inheritance tax. Introduce a 35% income tax rate between £42,285 and £55,000, at which point the 40% rate becomes payable. Set up a Treasury Commission to design a turnover tax on large businesses. Cut foreign aid budget by £9bn a year. Scrap HS2. Save £8bn a year in membership fees by leaving the EU.  Lower the VAT rate charged on restorations to listed buildings.Greens: People earning more than £100,000 a year would pay 50% income tax. Wealth tax of 1% to 2% on people worth £3m or more. Renationalise the railways and energy companies. Scrap HS2. Allow councils to impose extra business rates on out-of-town supermarkets to fund small local businesses. Crackdown on tax avoidance by multinationals. Allow ""the current dependence on economic growth to cease, and allow zero or negative growth to be feasible without individual hardship"". Commit Britain to a ""zero carbon"" future. Cut rail and bus fares by an average of 10%. Enforce a cap on bankers' bonuses.The NHSConservatives:  Chancellor George Osborne says he will put an extra £2bn into frontline health services across the UK, which he described as a ""down payment"" on a plan drawn up by NHS bosses calling for an extra £8bn a year above inflation by 2020. In England, everyone would be able to see a GP seven days a week by 2020. Recruit 5,000 more doctors.Labour:  Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said Labour would commit an extra £2.5bn a year above Mr Osborne's plan. The money will come from three sources - a new ""mansion"" tax, clamping down on tax avoidance by big corporations and a new tax on tobacco companies. Patients in England would get a GP appointment within 48 hours and would not have to wait longer than a week for cancer tests and results. Scrap the Health and Social Care Act and end ""creeping privatisation"" of the NHS.  Integrate health and social care services into a system of ""whole-person care"". Give greater priority to mental health services. Replace the Cancer Drugs Fund in England when it runs out in 2016 with a £330m fund to improve access to innovative cancer drugs, surgery and radiotherapy. Recruit 5,000 more healthcare workers to help patients stay in their homes and introduce new safety checks to identify people at risk of hospitalisation. Prioritise child mental health by increasing the proportion of the mental health budget spent on children.Lib Dems: An extra £1bn for the NHS every year, to be funded by - amongst other things - making higher earners pay more tax on their shares. Half of this will go towards mental health. Ensure that spending on the NHS rises in line with growth in the economy. People who need therapy for conditions such as depression will be guaranteed treatment within 18 weeks. For young patients experiencing psychosis for the first time treatment will be provided within two weeks of being referred by a GP. This is all going to happen from April, with more mental health targets to follow if the Lib Dems return to government. Wants a cross-party review of the future of NHS funding.SNP: Reduce the number of senior managers in the NHS by 25% over the next parliament. Streamline the work of health boards. Real terms increases in year-on-year NHS spending.Plaid Cymru: Recruit 1,000 extra doctors to the Welsh NHS over two terms of a Plaid government. Offer financial incentives for recruiting doctors to areas and specialisms where there are, or are predicted to be, shortages. Encourage innovation and attract more research funding, in part by increasing research and development funding as government finance allows. Improve training for postgraduate doctors and stop them being used to ""plug gaps"" in staff rotas. More recruitment from within the EU to fill vacancies and using international doctors to staff the NHS while a new generation of Welsh doctors are trained.UKIP: An extra £3bn per year in NHS funding paid for by quitting the EU and through ""middle management"" cuts. Keep NHS free at the point of delivery. Stop any further use of PFI, and encourage local authorities to buy out their PFI contracts early where it is affordable to do so. Ensure all visitors and migrants who have been here for fewer than five years have NHS-approved medical insurance as a condition of entry to UK, with £200m of the £2bn saved to be spent on ending hospital parking charges in England. Bring back state-enrolled nurses and return powers to matrons. Monitor and Care Quality Commission to be replaced with elected county health boards. Stop spending £90m a year on gastric band and breast enhancement operations.Greens: Funding to be diverted away from centralised facilities towards community healthcare, illness prevention and health promotion.  Stop privatisation. Abolish prescription charges. Dedicated NHS Tax to go direct to the health service. Ban proactive recruitment of non-British NHS staff from overseas. A complete ban on the promotion of tobacco and alcohol products, including sponsorship.Security, defence and foreign affairsConservatives: Hold a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU by 2017, after negotiating the return of some powers from Brussels. Protect foreign aid budget. Replace Trident.Labour:  Push for reform of European Union and prevent Britain from ""sleepwalking"" towards exit. Commit in law to holding a Strategic Defence and Security Review every 5 years. Outlaw discrimination and abuse of Armed Forces personnel.Lib Dems: Campaign to reduce the number of Trident nuclear submarines. Push for greater European Union efficiency. SNP: Oppose nuclear weapons and push for removal of Trident submarines from Scotland. In 2010, proposed a Scottish Centre for Reconciliation and Conflict Resolution, to promote peaceful alternatives to armed conflict. Maintain 0.7% commitment to foreign aid. Enhanced role for Scotland within the UK in Europe, particularly in fisheries policy.Plaid Cymru: Honour commitment of 0.7% of budget used for foreign aid. Campaign for cancellation of developing countries' debts. Support the Fair Trade movement. Support the 'Tobin' or 'Robin hood' tax as a means of encouraging more responsibility and stability in the global markets. Reform the IMF and World Bank in order to improve regulation and accountability. Continue membership of the EU, but campaign for democratic reform. Support minority nations and minority language speakers around the world. Pass a Military Wellbeing Act to promote and safeguard the physical and mental health and wellbeing of military personnel.UKIP:  Leave the European Union. Remove the passports of any person who has gone to fight for a terrorist organisation and deport anyone who has committed a terrorist act. Cut foreign aid budget by £9bn. Create a Veterans Department to look after the interests of ex-service men and women.Greens: Referendum on Britain's EU membership. Want reform of EU to hand powers back to local communities. Boost overseas aid to 1% of GDP within 10 years. Scrap Britain's nuclear weapons. Take the UK out of NATO unilaterally. End the so-called ""special relationship"" between the UK and the US.  Stop EU-US free trade deal TTIP. JobsConservatives: Create three million apprenticeships to be paid for by benefit cuts.Labour: Guarantee a job for under 25s unemployed for over a year and adults unemployed for more than two years. As many young people to go on an apprenticeship as currently go to university by 2025. Create a million new high technology, green jobs by 2025. Ban ""exploitative"" zero hour contracts.Lib Dems: An extra £1 an hour for the lowest paid apprentices. Campaign to create a million more jobs.SNP: Introduce gender quotas on public boards. Living wage ""a central priority"" in all Scottish government contracts. Continue the 'small business bonus'.Plaid Cymru: Provide rates relief for small businesses. Increase the number and value of contracts from Welsh public bodies that go to firms within Wales.UKIP: Allow firms to offer jobs to British workers first ""without the fear of being sued for discrimination"".Greens: A national energy conservation scheme to create thousands of new jobs. The party wants to create ""sustainable jobs"" and promotes more local production of food and goods.Education Conservatives: Protect England's schools budget - from reception entry at age four or five to the end of GCSEs at 16 - in cash terms although funding per pupil will not keep pace with inflation. Pre-school and post 16 education not ring fenced. Convert up to 3,500 more schools judged by Ofsted to ""require improvement"" into academies. ""War on illiteracy and innumeracy"". State primary schools in England that repeatedly failed to have a proportion of year-six pupil pass times tables and writing tests be forced to become academies, or have sponsorship replaced if already an academy. Opposed to giving votes to 16 and 17-year-olds for UK-wide general elections and local elections in England.Labour:  Increase the overall education budget in England, including schools, nurseries, Sure Start and provision for 16-to 18-year-olds, by at least the rate of inflation, although per-pupil funding is not specifically protected, meaning some of the increase will be eaten up by rising pupil numbers. Parents of primary school children would be guaranteed childcare from 8am to 6pm. The amount of free childcare for three and four year olds would be increased from 15 to 25 hours a week. Compulsory sex and relationship education in all schools. Refuse to grant business rate relief to independent schools unless they can show a ""meaningful impact"" on state schools through a new School Partnership Standard, for example by lending teaching staff or assisting in university admissions procedures. Committed to extending the franchise to 16 and 17-year-olds in elections across the UK. Double the number of Sure Start childcare places to more than 118,000. Tighten up the rules on primary school class sizes to ensure they do not have more than 30 pupils.Lib Dems: Protect the education budget from cuts. Guarantee qualified teachers and a core curriculum set by independent experts, as well as compulsory sex education, in all state schools including academies and free schools. More money for disadvantaged school children and free childcare for all two year olds. A two-thirds discount on all local bus fares for young people aged 16-21. Supports lowering the voting age to 16 in all UK elections.SNP: Guaranteed free 30 hours of childcare a week for three and four-year-olds in Scotland, up from 16 hours. Maintain lack of tuition fees at Scottish universities, and offer financial support in grants and loans to students. Continue to build and refurbish schools. Lower voting age to 16 in all UK elections.Plaid Cymru: Introduce a compulsory modern foreign language GCSE in secondary schools and the teaching of modern foreign languages in primary schools. Look at ways to strengthen the teaching of Welsh history and culture. Oppose foundation schools, academies and free schools. Look at moving from a per-pupil funding mechanism to a funding model based on the catchment area. Will not support any further increases in tuition fees for higher education students, and will seek the abolition of tuition fees as and when public finances allow. Supports lowering the voting age to 16 for elections to the Welsh Assembly and the UK Parliament.UKIP: More grammar schools. Scrap sex education for children aged under seven. Scrap tuition fees for students from poorer backgrounds who take degree courses in the sciences, technology, maths or engineering. Greater emphasis on vocational education with new Apprenticeship Qualification Option. School governing boards must be made up of at least 30% parents of children at the school. Allow universities to charge same amount for EU students as non-EU students.Greens: End performance related pay for teachers. Replace Ofsted with an independent National Council for Educational Excellence. Bring Free Schools and Academies into local authority control.

Withdraw Jobseeker's Allowance from young people after six months unless they take part in ""community projects"". And 18 to 21-year-olds wouldn't be entitled to housing benefit. Ban on zero-hours contracts which stop people getting work elsewhere. Raise the personal allowance - the point at which you start paying income tax - to £11,000 in April 2016 and then to £12,500 by 2020, which means that if you work on minimum wage for 30 hours you will pay no income tax. Young people out of work, education or training for six months will have to do unpaid community work to get benefits. This will apply to about 50,000 18 to 21-year-olds. Universal benefits for pensioners, such as free bus passes, TV licences for the over 75s and the winter fuel allowance. will once again be protected. Labour: Freeze energy prices until 2017. Increase in the minimum wage from £6.50-an-hour to £8-an-hour by 2020. Rises in child benefit capped at 1% for the first two years of the next parliament. Winter fuel allowance would be withdrawn from the wealthiest pensioners. Repeal what the government calls the spare room subsidy, dubbed the ""bedroom tax"" by Labour.  A million interest-free loans to help people insulate their homes. Rail fares would be capped. Double the amount of paid paternity leave available to new fathers from two to four weeks, and increase statutory paternity pay to £260 a week.Lib Dems: Raise the personal allowance - the point at which you start paying income tax - to £11,000 in April 2016 and then to £12,500 by 2020 (the Conservatives are promising the same thing). Nick Clegg has said he would not accept Conservative plans to freeze working-age benefits without taxing the rich too. He hasn't said he would block welfare cuts altogether. Withdraw eligibility for the Winter Fuel Payment and free TV Licence from pensioners on the 40% rate of income tax. A ""yellow card"" system to deal with benefit claimants breaking the rules, rather than imposing sanctions without warning.SNP: Oppose cuts to in-work benefits. Support moves to extend paternity leave. Introduce a maximum combined withdrawal rate for benefits and reforms to employment support allowance and cold weather payments. Protect policies such as concessionary travel for older Scots.Plaid Cymru: Move away from complex and expensive means testing for child-related benefits. Continue to campaign for the introduction of a living pension during the period of the next parliament for those aged 80 and over. UKIP: Only pay child benefit for the first two children for new claimants. Increase the Carers' Allowance to the same level as Jobseekers' Allowance (JSA) and pay a higher rate of JSA if you've been in work and already made tax and National Insurance contributions. Prevent anyone taking up permanent residence in Britain unless they're able to support themselves and any dependents they bring with them for at least five years and stop them receiving benefits. Stop paying child benefit for children who don't live in Britain. Scrap what UKIP calls the ""detested bedroom tax"". Boost ""credit unions"".Greens: The party backs a Citizen's Income, a fixed amount of £72 income a week to be paid to every individual, whether they are in work or not, to be funded by higher taxes on the better off and green levies.  But in the short-term it would increase the minimum wage to £10 by 2020. Ban zero hours contracts. Axe the ""bedroom tax"". Abolish the work capability assessment and restore the level of the former disability living allowance. Scrap the government's welfare cap, which limits the maximum amount a household can claim annually to £26,000 a year."

2015-04-11,Elephant trap?,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32047998,"The campaign has not even got under way, yet in the space of a couple of hours we have now been treated to not only one election pledge, but to two. The prime minister ruled out raising VAT if re-elected - while Labour said National Insurance contributions wouldn't go up.Usually politicians fudge the question of tax rises.  When he was leader of the opposition David Cameron himself said ""we have no need to raise taxes"" - before hiking up VAT after polling day.Famously, John Major said he had ""no plans"" to put up the sales tax -  before his chancellor did just that.And when he appeared in front of the cross-party Treasury committee of MPs on Tuesday, the current chancellor seemed to be continuing that tradition.  Under repeated questioning, George Osborne said: ""The policies we have do not involve a VAT rise.""That formulation appeared to give him not so much wriggle room, but an entire wriggle mansion.Labour assumed their campaign warning of further VAT rises to come under the Tories was very much on the money.But George Osborne's allies are suggesting privately that he had, in fact, been walking Ed Miliband to the edge of an elephant trap, then beckoning the prime minister to push the opposition leader in.Ed Miliband's strategists fully expected Mr Cameron to repeat the chancellor's obfuscation on tax at the final Prime Minister's Questions of this Parliament. They would then have expanded on the theme, inviting the prime minister to answer other difficult questions - then say he wasn't being straight with the British people for avoiding them.But the Labour leader was completely wrong-footed when first the prime minister said he would rule out a VAT rise and then counter-punched, inquiring if Labour would now rule out an increase in National Insurance contributions.Ed Miliband dodged the question and what could have been downbeat Conservative benches, uneasy over the prime minister's announcement this week of his retirement plans, were given something to cheer.The reason Ed Miliband didn't respond is because he was holding the National Insurance pledge back for Labour's manifesto.But that soon became unsustainable - so the other Ed, the shadow chancellor Ed Balls, had to undertake a hasty round of the TV studios to do just that.When I spoke to him mid-tour, he put on a brave face. His view was that George Osborne, having raised VAT from 17.5% to 20%, wanted to give the issue a low profile - whereas the prime minister had now made the mistake of putting it centre stage. And he believed David Cameron's promise would be judged against his past VAT-raising performance.He defended Ed Miliband's reluctance to talk about National Insurance as he felt it would have been ""inappropriate"" to announce Labour tax policy at PMQs.So the prime minister - always a better tactician than strategist - can at least satisfy himself that he smoked Labour out on NI and disrupted at least one entry in their election campaign grid.But the exchange actually raised more questions than it answered.If the main parties are ruling out further potential sources of revenue, but still committing themselves to eradicating a £90bn black hole in the public finances, will they now be under more pressure during the election campaign to spell out in much greater detail exactly what they intend to cut?"
2015-04-11,Who's next?,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32031343,"David Cameron's declaration that he will not seek a third term in office if he retains power in May has immediately stoked interest in who might fill his shoes when he's gone. Here are the likely - and perhaps less obvious - possibilities.Claim? As chancellor of the exchequer he's the man in charge of the purse strings and master strategist - and reportedly the PM's favourite to succeed him, although he hasn't said as much. Mr Cameron's right-hand man has had an image makeover of late, with a new haircut and a diet to shed some pounds. And he has seemingly recovered from his ""omnishambles"" Budget in 2012, with his latest - and last Budget - of the parliament giving the Tories a lead in some polls. He's said to be well liked among Conservative cabinet ministers and backbench MPs, whose support is vital for any candidate wanting to take on the party leadership. He shas some work to do among grassroots Tory members, however, coming fifth in ConservativeHome's latest online poll of party members on future leaders.Latest odds: 10/1 (according to William Hill)What's he said? ""The prime minister leads a strong team but what you see from him is answering a direct question with a direct answer. I think that's really refreshing. He says he's going to serve that full five years so the real question facing the country now is do you want the strong leadership of David Cameron that's delivering zero inflation and record jobs or do you want the chaos and incompetence of Ed Miliband.""Claim? The longest-serving home secretary in 50 years, she is only the second Conservative woman to secure one of the top four jobs in government. In her role, she has talked tough on immigration and crime and taken on the Police Federation. And she is popular with Tory activists, consistently occupying either first or second place in ConservativeHome's online polls on future party leaders. There have long been claims of Mrs May positioning herself for the top job, with reported tensions between her and the prime minister. Critics say she lacks charisma and micro-manages - while some cannot forget her coining the now infamous ""nasty party"" phrase at a Tory conference in 2002, but supporters say she is a formidable operator, and have dubbed her Britain's Angela Merkel. Latest odds: 9/2What's she said? ""My view is very simple, David Cameron is a first class leader of the party and a first class prime minister and I hope he is going to be doing that for a very long time."" (Desert Island discs, 23 November 2014)Claim? The blonde bombshell and mayor of London who can seemingly reach voters that others in the party cannot. Casting aside a rather chequered past he steered the capital through the 2012 Olympics, launched the successful and popular ""Boris bikes"" and got rid of London's ""bendy buses"" in favour of the new Routemaster double deckers. Mr Johnson hopes to revive his Westminster parliamentary career at the general election. He has been tipped by many to take the helm of the Conservative Party, and has not discouraged the idea. Like Theresa May, he is also a favourite among the grassroots of the party, pipping her to the top spot in ConservativeHome's latest poll of party members on future leaders. (he's ahead by 2 points). Critics say the gaffe-prone politician is not the right man for the job, but his supporters point to his wide-spread appeal.Latest odds: 9/4What's he said? ""I think what David Cameron is saying is banal and obvious. There has already been a leader of the Conservative Party for ten years and he's done an outstanding job. What he's saying now is that he wants to serve through to 2020 and that is frankly what we need him to do... five more years is what this country needs. I'm not entirely certain I see what the story is. He was asked a straight question, are you going to serve a third term like Mrs Thatcher or Tony Blair and he said no, because he thinks that ten years on top of British politics is an incredibly long time.""Claim? A self-made millionaire and devotee of Margaret Thatcher, he is regarded as one of the Conservatives' fastest-rising stars. The Treasury minister-turned-culture secretary became the first of the 2010 intake of MPs to reach cabinet level, and the first Asian male Conservative cabinet minister. He's currently polling well among the Conservative grassroots, who voted him third most preferable leader in ConservativeHome's latest online future leader poll. David Cameron recently said he wants to see a British Asian prime minister in his lifetime.Latest odds: 12/1Claim? Currently holding one of the four great offices of state - foreign secretary - Mr Hammond's name has often cropped up whenever talk of leadership contenders has emerged. He has built up an impressive CV in government since the Conservatives came to power in 2010, being first awarded the job of transport secretary before his promotion to defence secretary where he stayed for three years. He's regarded by many commentators as being a potential candidate for the Tory right. He seems to have work to do among party activists, scoring only 4% in ConservativeHome's future leader poll.Latest odds: 12/1"
2015-04-11,Cereal number,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-magazine-monitor-31962592,"David Cameron has declared he won't seek a third term as prime minister, citing an advertising slogan for Shredded Wheat used in the UK more than 30 years ago. What's its enduring power, asks Justin Parkinson.The hotel kitchen staff are in disbelief. Someone in room 147 has ordered three Shredded Wheat. The maid transports them upstairs to find England cricketer Ian Botham waiting at a table, dressed in full whites.The maid leaves. Botham hides one of the Shredded Wheat under a napkin and winks to camera. Cue music, as the slogan ""Shredded Wheat. Bet you can't eat three"" appears.This advert and others featuring football manager Brian Clough and the actor Richard Kiel, who played Jaws in James Bond films, have not run for some time. Nestle, which owns the brand, says the last probably aired in 1984.But their message seems to have waned little. Telling the BBC he would only serve a limited time in Downing Street, David Cameron said: ""Terms are like Shredded Wheat - two are wonderful but three might just be too many.""The prime minister's reprise was unlikely to be accidental, says Thayne Forbes, joint managing director of the brand-valuation company Intangible Business. ""Everybody would empathise with the view that three Shredded Wheat would probably be too much,"" he says. ""The slogan suggests people shouldn't overdo it. It sounds modest and reasoned.""As marketing goes, it might seem counter-intuitive, as it discourages excessive consumption. But it also sounds honest and unexploitative.Other advertising slogans and themes are in wide use in public and political discourse. Examples include Marmite being a by-word for divisiveness - a ""Marmite person"" is either loved or hated. Cameron has twice referred to Ronseal - the woodcare product that does ""exactly what it says on the tin"". But Shredded Wheat, its best-known slogan having lain dormant for so long, appears to be used less often. The cereal, created in the US in the 1890s, has long been sold as good for the evolving British lifestyle. A newspaper advert in 1902 described it as ""a relief from the monotony of everlasting porridge"", while, by 1943, it was ""an ideal food for all war workers"". The 1980s saw an emphasis on ""simple, honest goodness"", while, in the 2000s, its long heritage and reliability was promoted.""It's a good association for Cameron,"" says Forbes. ""He must have been brought up on it, like lots of other people. It will be great marketing for Shredded Wheat to have the slogan used after so many years, too.""Subscribe to the BBC News Magazine's email newsletter to get articles sent to your inbox"
2015-04-11,Are you 'cosmopolitan'?,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32021853,"The rise of UKIP heralds the emergence of a new divide in British politics, with cosmopolitan voters on one side and non-cosmopolitan ones on the other, argues Jeremy Cliffe.We hear a lot about UKIP these days. The party stole the show at the local and European elections last year, then again in the autumn when it lured two Conservative MPs to defect.  In the past weeks alone there have been three much-discussed television programmes about the party: ""Meet the Ukippers"", ""Farage Fans and UKIP Lovers"" and ""100 Days of UKIP"". At the upcoming general election the party will probably increase its share of seats in Westminster - and will certainly affect the results in dozens of other constituencies by taking votes from the other parties. But ask some of those academics who have been watching UKIP's rise, and they will tell you that it is just one part of a bigger story. We are all used to the left-right divide in politics: a spectrum of different views on how much the government should tax, spend, regulate and otherwise intervene in the economy. But according to Dr Rob Ford of Manchester University, UKIP exists on a different axis, one to do with cultural rather than economic matters. This new political scale is ever more prominent in British political life.Radio 4's Analysis programmeOn the one end of it is what you might call a ""cosmopolitan"" philosophy: a relaxed, liberal attitude to issues concerning national identity (like immigration) and to questions of morality and lifestyle (like gay marriage). On the other end is a ""non-cosmopolitan"" outlook: more nationalist, socially conservative and less comfortable with social change, or in other words the ideological stance often associated with typical UKIP voters. This divide cuts across the left-right scale: there are cosmopolitan and non-cosmopolitan voters in both the Conservative and the Labour camps, which is why UKIP takes support from both.Lots of things are making this cosmopolitanism divide more important. One is that the old class-based, ideological conflict between left and right has declined. Dr James Tilley of Oxford University argues that politicians are partly to blame. The economic philosophies of the Conservative and Labour parties are so similar, he argues, that other, cultural issues are becoming more important. Another factor is the growing gap between the generations: the difference in outlook between the cosmopolitan young and less cosmopolitan, older voters is greater than it was in the past (partly due to the recent rise in levels of university education, which tend to correlate with liberal views). This trend presents the established parties with some difficult questions. As Dr Ford puts it, they ""have to try and deal with this rising value divide, particularly now that UKIP has mobilised it into the political debate."" ""They have to make a move,"" he adds, ""but any move that they make risks making their position worse with one or the other of these groups of voters."" Sound too cosmopolitan, and the parties risk losing supporters to UKIP. Try to ""out-UKIP UKIP"", and they could alienate their younger, more socially liberal supporters. So both are doing the political splits, trying to reconcile the cosmopolitans within their ranks with the non-cosmopolitans. Witness the tortuous attempts by Ed Miliband to sound tough on immigration without sounding too tough. Witness, too, the recent struggles of David Cameron to persuade social conservatives in his party that gay marriage can be an innately conservative institution. In the long-term, this divide will become less problematic. That is because over the years the country will tilt towards the cosmopolitan end of this new spectrum. So says Penny Young of NatCen, the research organisation that conducts the extensive British Social Attitudes survey. Various demographic factors explain this trend. The country as a whole is becoming more accepting of same-sex relationships. Younger voters are more relaxed about things like immigration and national identity than were previous generations when they were young, suggesting that the overall population will tilt in an internationalist direction over time. And ever more parts of the country are acquiring the ethnic and social diversity once confined to the inner cities, a trend that generally makes people more comfortable with immigration. According to Dr Ford the question is therefore: how should the main political parties navigate this period of transition? It would be wrong to simply abandon the swathes of voters at the less cosmopolitan end of the scale; voters who are usually older and more isolated than the average member of the population.Yet the politicians do need to adapt to the changing attitudes of British society and be honest with voters rather than pandering to views that, deep down, they do not share. This quandary may not decide the upcoming general election, but in the established parties savvy strategists with an eye to elections in 2020 and beyond are grappling with it nonetheless. That is a wise move."
2015-04-11,Dudley debate,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32015334,"I met Afzal Amin for the first time on Friday, but I already knew who he was. In Dudley North, the seat he was selected by the Conservatives to fight in the general election, Mr Amin had become hard to avoid. When I first looked at the local newspaper online, the pages were surrounded by ""Amin"" logos in the preferred Tory shade of blue.Not long after we met, he asked me to pose for a photo, snapped by one of his campaign team, and doubtless rapidly tweeted out to followers of the would-be MP.Perhaps no surprise that the man running such a disciplined operation has served in the army and been to Sandhurst. That was very much the message he delivered on Friday, as he addressed school and college pupils at a hustings in Dudley which I'd been invited to chair.There was combative debate, too, not least with his Labour rival, the MP Ian Austin. Both men knew the Dudley contest was critical for their respective parties; Ian Austin held the seat by just over 600 votes in 2010. Just as David Cameron was denied a majority by failing to take seats like this one, so Ed Miliband is unlikely to be in No 10 if Labour loses Dudley North.He was self-confident and fluent. The only obvious mis-step came right at the end, when he interrupted Vicky Duckworth, the Green candidate for the neighbouring seat. She expressed the opinion that politics often seemed to be about men shouting at each other; Mr Amin complained she was engaging in gender bias.A few weeks ago, one Conservative MP who knows him well and respects his talents, said Afzal Amin had warned him of the risks of over-confidence. He thought he risked running before he could walk.Well, he stumbled badly this weekend. Whatever the purpose of his contacts with the English Defence League - and he strongly disputes claims that he wanted them to hold a protest that would then be called off, for which he could then take the credit - the exposure has damaged him and, potentially, the prospects of his party re-taking the seat.In February, the EDL staged a rally against plans for a new mosque in the town. As the Mail on Sunday story makes clear, Afzal Amin pleaded with them beforehand not to hold that demonstration; but it went ahead anyway. It's what happened subsequently which will feature in Tuesday's disciplinary hearing.Over the weekend, I put his defence to a very senior Conservative source - that this was an attempt to broker a compromise in order to bring together a divided community. The arch response: Dudley isn't Kandahar.Nor do I think from my visits to the town, where I'm going to be based for the general election, will people in Dudley appreciate being painted as somewhere riven by racial discord.True, Dudley was the scene of one of England's earliest race riots. But that was in 1962. Although the controversy over replacing the mosque - currently in a converted school and inadequate for the numbers who want to worship there - has been running for a decade, community relations are generally good. Even those who don't want a new mosque didn't want the EDL protestors - nor to be fair the anti-fascist counter-demonstrators who followed them.As for the Conservative Party, the view of the national leadership is that you don't collaborate with the EDL. Not least because the Tories are still struggling to bury some historic baggage in the Black Country: Enoch Powell was an MP in Wolverhampton when he delivered his Rivers of Blood speech about immigration in 1968.Four years before that, there was the notorious election in Smethwick which the Conservatives were accused of winning by wooing white voters with an offensive rhyme suggesting who'd they'd get as a neighbour if they voted Labour. Afzal Amin grew up in Smethwick so he should be aware of that history. He was, until his suspension on Saturday, one of about 17% of Conservative parliamentary candidates who are not white. The party is proud of that, but it's still struggling to translate that into votes.Afzal Amin may believe that he can persuade the party to lift the suspension when he meets party officials on Tuesday. I have my doubts. Even if they accept his defence, will the other parties be so charitable? The allegations would follow him on the campaign trail, and make planned visits by cabinet ministers next to impossible.On Friday, just before the hustings in Dudley began, Afzal Amin gave me his business card. It introduces him as 'prospective member of Parliament Dudley North'. I think I'll keep it; it could yet become a collector's item."

2015-04-12,Bid to change Speaker election rules,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32061097,"A last-minute bid to change the way the Speaker of the House of Commons is elected is to be debated by MPs.Labour criticised the government motion, to be debated on the final day before the dissolution of Parliament, saying the Conservatives were ""trying to play politics with the speakership"".Under the proposals, a secret ballot would decide whether there should be a contested election for the post.MPs currently have to file through the division lobbies to cast their vote.This means it is clear who does or does not back the incumbent as Speaker.Labour's shadow leader of the Commons Angela Eagle raised the party's concerns in the House on Wednesday evening, questioning whether the motion was within parliamentary rules.Current Speaker John Bercow is - technically - one of them, but many Tory MPs have never liked him.They resent his personal style and some believe he is far from impartial in the way he conducts business in the Commons.Attempts by some to force a vote on his resumption as Speaker in 2010 came to nothing. There have been the occasional measured jibes at him from the prime minister. Other Tories reportedly went much further and formed a group whose members had all been reprimanded by him. But the Speaker is a reformer who believes passionately that the people who elect the members, and pay the bills, should come first.The last act of the coalition looks like being an attempt to unseat him. And they are very serious about it.One Tory MP fighting an important marginal seat had been cleared by his party to be away from Parliament but he is now staying for the vote, such is the importance of it.She told Deputy Speaker Lindsay Hoyle: ""It's just come to my attention that the government has tabled a motion for debate on the final day of this Parliament, with no notice whatsoever to myself as shadow leader of the House, proposing changes to the way in which the Speaker of this House is elected.""Procedural matters in this House, with no consultation with the opposition, no consultation with the chair of the committee itself, for debate in only one hour tomorrow.""Mr Hoyle said the motion had been ""rightly or wrongly"" agreed to on Tuesday, saying that ""business of the House is decided by the government, not by the chair.""A spokesman for Commons Leader William Hague said the motion had been tabled as a free hour had opened up in Thursday's business after the House of Lords approved the Modern Slavery Bill.The proposed change would apply when a Speaker wishes to continue in the post after a general election.Under the current rules, if the Speaker's re-appointment is objected to, a division is held, with MPs choosing to back or oppose the Speaker in the division lobbies.The replacement of this method with a secret ballot was suggested in 2010 by a committee of MPs, which said the public method ""can be seen as a deterrent to the House expressing its views honestly"".MPs will now debate whether this change should be made."

2015-04-12,MPs warn on growth of UK jihadists,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32059813,"Not enough is being done to prevent people leaving the UK to join Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, a group of MPs has warned.Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said Britain must win their ""hearts and minds"".The committee's report comes as the BBC launches a database tracking British jihadists in Syria and Iraq. It shows that many people left in clusters from certain UK areas - often due to friendships and peer groups. The MPs' report argued that preventative work with communities, families and international partners was ""vital"" and needs to be a top priority for the Home Office.  ""The number of cases being brought to public attention should ring alarm bells,"" said Labour MP Mr Vaz.  ""This must be a relentless battle for hearts and minds, and without a strong counter-narrative we are in danger of failing to prevent even more departures. We are at the edge of a cliff."" The BBC has been tracking the stories of the men, women, boys and girls who have gone to Syria and Iraq to understand why they go, where they go from and what happens to them. By analysing around 160 profiles, it reveals the way in which people have travelled in clusters - a group of three young friends from Coventry, another group from Portsmouth, drawn out by one person they knew, others in Cardiff linked to people involved in an extremist organisation. Social media might play a part but face-to-face contact appears just as, if not more, important, according to the database.It includes the stories of: The BBC research emphasises the extent to which real-world contacts, rather than just online connections, are often a key driver of radicalisation and intent to travel to Iraq and Syria. Some of the experts who appeared before the Home Affairs Committee also argued the internet was a secondary influence. They said that universities and prisons were among the two most significant places where radicalisation occurred. A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police, which was not aware of the report, said it would have ""welcomed the opportunity"" to have given evidence to the committee and that it planned to look at the report in detail.The disappearance of schoolgirls Shamima Begum, Amira Abase, both 15, and Kadiza Sultana, 16, from east London in February, raised questions as to who could have done more to prevent their departure. After taking evidence from the police and the families of the girls among others, Mr Vaz said their case suffered from a ""lack of immediate action"". He added: ""Schools and the police must inform parents immediately, and work with them even if there is the smallest hint of radicalisation, or a close association with someone who is thought to have been radicalised.""However, the Met Police spokesman defended the speed of the police response to the schoolgirls' disappearance.  He said the committee's criticism was ""misleading"", pointing to the evidence given by both UK and Turkish authorities of ""rapid exchanges"" between the two.The committee's report said there needed to be an advice service which would be a less extreme step than calling the anti-terrorist hotline.The Association of Chief Police Officer's lead officer for the government's anti-terror strategy Prevent, Chief Constable Sir Peter Fahy, agreed that more needed to be done.However, he said the police ""do not have the capacity"" to routinely work with every school in the country.He added: ""The police service will play its part but the prime responsibility for dissuading young people from getting involved in extremist activity has to lie with parents, families and carers.""The committee also pointed to weaknesses in information sharing with airlines and other countries. It said greater care needed to be taken at airport check-in desks when people were travelling to destinations of concern - namely Syria, Somalia, Iraq and Nigeria, as well as neighbouring countries, such as Turkey. The report said police also needed to work faster to alert overseas partners and airlines when there were concerns over individuals.There were signs that some of the girls had followed extremist accounts on social media, the report said.The committee said that social media companies, such as Facebook and Twitter, should be prepared to suspend accounts when there is evidence they are being used to promote violent extremism.  The report also said it was disappointed the Home Office had not implemented a programme for individuals returning to Britain where there is evidence they had fought in Syria.Security officials estimate that some 600 Britons have left the country to join IS - and while around half may have returned, many are still out there - and some have died.  The BBC project includes detailed profiles of individuals which can be searched, based on hometown, age and gender, as well as those who have been convicted in the courts or who are believed to have been killed."

If not, the prince's private letters will either remain confidential, as the sender intended, or they'll be exposed to a large and inquisitive audience.

That will be a clear pledge from us.""He accused Mr Cameron of making an ""out of the blue, panicky"" announcement on VAT that ""no one in Britain will believe"".Labour, which has already announced plans to increase the top rate of income tax and impose a new ""mansion tax"" on high value properties, insists its plans are fully costed and will not require additional tax hikes if it wins May's general election.Mr Miliband began his final head-to-head encounter with Mr Cameron before the election by joking that the PM had ""announced his retirement plans"" - a reference to a BBC interview in which the prime minister said he would not serve a third term if the Tories remained in power.Challenging Mr Cameron to give a ""straight answer to a straight question"", Mr Miliband pressed him on whether he would rule out a rise in VAT after the election, as Labour had done.In response, the prime minister immediately said ""yes"", prompting loud cheers in turn from the Conservative benches. He contrasted what he said was a ""clear promise"" with Labour's unwillingness to rule out a rise in National Insurance.""I answered a very simple question about VAT. I ruled out an increase... straight answer to him, straight question from me. I have ruled out VAT. Will he rule out national insurance contributions. Yes or no?"" Mr Cameron added: ""We all know this is Labour's job tax. This is their tax of choice. This is what they clobber working people, families and enterprises with.""But Mr Miliband responded by saying there was ""only one person who is going to raise taxes on working families and that is him"".He said nobody would believe Mr Cameron on VAT ""because of his extreme spending plans, because his numbers do not add up and because he promised it last time and broke his promise"".Mr Cameron, he added, had broken other promises made before the last election to reduce annual net migration below 100,000 and not to pursue a major structural re-organisation of the NHS, adding that it was ""time for a better plan and time for a Labour government"".But Mr Cameron suggested a future Labour government would result in the ""chaos of economic crisis"", with Ed Miliband being ""held hostage"" by the SNP.The packed session provided a last opportunity for the two men to rally their MPs and set out their arguments before the start of the election campaign next week.Speaking after the exchanges and the other parties' tax pledges, deputy prime minister Nick Clegg said the Lib Dems ""don't need to raise VAT, national insurance or headline rates of income tax or corporation tax either"".""There are other taxes and other tax loopholes that we can increase or close in order to balance the books,"" he said.

2015-04-12,Met police 'had files on MPs in 90s',https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32044580,"A former undercover police officer has told BBC News that Scotland Yard kept intelligence files on MPs during the 1990s. Ex-Special Branch officer Peter Francis says he saw files on 10 Labour MPs which he and others regularly updated. He says he personally gathered information on three MPs as part of his work infiltrating left-wing groups. The MPs named, and Labour, have called for a forthcoming public inquiry into undercover policing to be widened. Mr Francis operated undercover between 1993 and 1997 in the Met's now disbanded Special Demonstration Squad. He was told to embed himself in left-wing groups or causes that were deemed to pose a potential threat to security. He says that during this period he was told to gather intelligence on MPs and their activities if and when they featured in any of his operations. That information, he says, was added to a special pink file that was available for Special Branch officers to read. Between 1990 and 2001, he claims to have personally seen records relating to Diane Abbott, the late Tony Benn, Jeremy Corbyn, the late Bernie Grant, Peter Hain, Harriet Harman, Ken Livingstone, Joan Ruddock, Dennis Skinner and Jack Straw.Four of the group became ministers during Mr Francis's time in Special Branch - including Jack Straw who was home secretary after 1997. ""When I was deployed undercover in the Special Demonstration Squad, any MP that I came across, such as on demonstrations, I would report back on them,"" he said. Mr Francis says that the files not only contained the MPs' publicly-stated political views - but also intelligence on what was going on behind the scenes in the party or their group. He says some of the information would have been things said in private by the MP, depending on how close each undercover officer had been able to get. Mr Francis said that when he first saw the files he understood that each had probably been created before the individual was an MP because of their personal involvement in radical causes or protests.But he added: ""When they became MPs these files carried on. It [was] your duty as an SDS officer to report back any intelligence that you come across. ""I felt that it was OK to report back on MPs,"" he said. ""I used to give myself a pat on the back, thinking 'I have done a good job'. These MPs were spied on and they should know.""""I don't think the police force should be monitoring MPs, full stop. I don't think we have any right to do that at all. It may be justifiable to say that the Security Service should be doing it - but I certainly don't think the police should be doing it.""Scotland Yard has refused to comment on the substance of the claims, but a spokesman said it had not shied away from serious allegations about the SDS. It said that Operation Herne, the internal police investigation into what happened in the unit, remained an ongoing investigation.""Operation Herne maintains that without speaking to Peter Francis it is simply not possible to fully investigate allegations he makes,"" said a spokesman. ""Operation Herne remains very willing to engage with him.""Mr Francis said that he has refused to speak to Operation Herne because he fears being interviewed under caution as a suspect, rather than a whistleblower. Scotland Yard told the BBC that Operation Herne detectives would be prepared to speak to him as a witness. He has, however, spoken to Mark Ellison QC who reviewed allegations about the SDS for the Home Secretary Theresa May - prompting her to launch a statutory inquiry. He says he will appear before those hearings. Peter Hain, who was a leader of the anti-apartheid movement in the late 1960s and 70s and became an MP in 1991, said he now wants full answers from Scotland Yard. ""I was deeply disturbed to find that files were still being kept by the Special Branch while I and others were serving Members of Parliament,"" he said. ""That is constitutionally an outrage. It infringes the sovereignty of Parliament. ""I want to see the home secretary widen the scope of the inquiry into the SDS to look specifically at the surveillance of MPs and the fact that there were active files on us while we were serving Members of Parliament. ""This should never have happened and it should have been reported and properly authorised - and we don't know whether it was.""Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper echoed the call for the inquiry to be widened in light of what she described as ""extremely serious and disturbing allegations"".""While undercover policing remains a crucial tool in combating serious and organised crime it must not be abused,"" she said.""There have now been a series of serious allegations about undercover policing - ranging from the treatment of Stephen Lawrence's family to police having long-term inappropriate relationships. ""We called some time ago for much stronger oversight of undercover policing and it is also vital to get to the truth about what has happened."" Mrs May announced earlier this month that Lord Justice Pitchford would lead the inquiry into the SDS allegations - but the precise shape of that inquiry is not yet clear.A Home Office spokesman said the review by Mark Ellison QC had unearthed ""serious historical failings"". ""That is why the Home Secretary established a public inquiry to thoroughly investigate undercover policing and the operation of the Special Demonstration Squad. ""Lord Justice Pitchford will consult interested parties to the inquiry over the coming months on setting the terms of reference, with a view to publishing these at the end of July.""Undercover policing is an essential tactic in the fight against crime but to improve the public's confidence in undercover work we must ensure there is no repeat of these failings in the future."""
2015-04-12,NHS problems worst 'since 1990s',https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/health-32057948,"Services in the NHS in England are deteriorating in a way not seen since the early 1990s, according to a leading health think tank. The King's Fund review said waiting times for A&E, cancer care and routine operations had all started getting worse, while deficits were growing.It said such drops in performance had not been seen for 20 years.But the think tank acknowledged the NHS had done as well as could be expected, given the financial climate.Professor John Appleby, chief economist at the King's Fund, which specialises in health care policy, said: ""The next government will inherit a health service that has run out of money and is operating at the very edge of its limits. ""There is now a real risk that patient care will deteriorate as service and financial pressures become overwhelming.""He said in terms of how standards were slipping - not how low they had reached - the situation was the worst it had been since the ""early 1990s"".The report noted much of the deterioration has happened in the second-half of the Parliament with many measures of performance being maintained in the first few years.It said the next government had to address the funding situation, adding the extra £8bn a year NHS England says is needed by 2020, was the ""minimum"" that would be required.The report - a review of performance this Parliament - highlights a range of problems as well as achievements. These include:The report is the second part of the King's Fund pre-election review of the NHS this Parliament.Last month it warned the coalition government's reforms of the health service had been ""damaging and distracting"".The King's Fund report should make worrying reading. The reference to the 1990s conjures up images of - for the NHS at least - a bygone era. The think tank's point was not that waiting times had reached the level they were at then, rather that this is the first time in two decades of almost continuous improvement that there has been a sustained drop in performance.In many ways, that had to happen. Services cannot keep getting better for ever. Nonetheless, the findings are crystal clear: the NHS is at a critical juncture. But what is less easy to determine is to what extent the coalition's policies have contributed to the difficulties.The think tank has already provided a critical analysis of the government's reforms - and when pushed, acknowledged the health service may have been ""in better shape"" if they had not happened.But the more significant issue for the health of the health service this Parliament has been the squeeze on finances. Even though the budget has been increased, it has felt more like a cut to many because demands have risen so quickly.On this though, the King's Fund accepted that the government's hands were tied. Given the state of the economy, ministers did as much as they could have.Read more from NickRoyal College of Nursing general secretary Peter Carter said politicians needed to take note of the warnings made by the King's Fund.""Morale is low, and more and more staff are being made sick with stress because of the intolerable pressure they are under,"" he added. Katherine Murphy, of the Patients Association, said: ""The findings echo what we are hearing on a daily basis on our helpline. It is clear to the public that the future of the NHS is one of the most important issues facing the nation and it should be a central issue in the election campaign.""Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham said: ""Five years ago David Cameron stood on a promise to protect the NHS. This report provides authoritative proof that he has broken that promise.""But a Department of Health spokesman said: ""As the King's Fund says, the NHS has 'performed well in the face of huge challenges', but if we are to continue to invest in the NHS going forward it needs to be backed by a strong economy.""

2015-04-12,SNP 'could block Tory government',https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32045419,"The SNP would block a minority Conservative government by voting down its Queen's Speech if it holds the post-election balance of power, its former leader Alex Salmond has said.Mr Salmond said the move could bring down the government if Labour joined in, with David Cameron ""locked out"".The Conservatives accused him of ""trying to sabotage the democratic will of the British people"".Labour has called his balance of power prediction ""bluster and bluff"".In recent days Mr Salmond, who is bidding to become a Westminster MP at the 7 May general election, has claimed his party could ""hold the power"" in a hung Parliament and would be able to influence the Budget of a minority Labour government.This was dismissed by Labour leader Ed Miliband, who has ruled out a formal coalition with the Scottish nationalists.The SNP currently has six MPs at Westminster, but recent opinion polls suggest its share could increase dramatically at the general election.James Cook, BBC News Scotland correspondentIf the Conservatives attempt to form a minority government and enough MPs vote against their Queen's Speech the administration would fall at the first hurdle and the leader of the opposition would have a shot at forming a government.That's how parliamentary democracy works in the event of a hung Parliament.And yet the Conservatives are saying that by planning to vote against a government he opposes Alex Salmond has ""confirmed he would sabotage the democratic will of the British people in order to make Ed Miliband prime minister"".It is part of their continuing attempt to portray Mr Miliband as a weak leader whose strings are being pulled by Mr Salmond.This kind of language causes despair among Tories north of the border who fear that the party in London is waltzing into an SNP trap.They know that many voters in Scotland will read the phrase ""democratic will of the British people"" and hear ""democratic will of the English people"".Because, if it is illegitimate for Scottish MPs, from whatever party, to vote against one government and support another in the British parliament, then what, voters may ask, is the point of the union?Who is dancing to Mr Salmond's tune now?Mr Salmond, the former Scottish first minister, told the New Statesman that in the event of a hung Parliament, a minority Conservative government would have to ""go straight effectively for a vote of confidence - usually the Queen's Speech, although it could be otherwise, of course - and we'd be voting against.""If David Cameron lost this vote, he said, there would be a two-week period for another government to be formed.BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said Mr Salmond had ""hardened his anti-Conservative rhetoric"" in the interview.A Conservative spokesman said:  ""Alex Salmond has confirmed he would sabotage the democratic will of the British people in order to make Ed Miliband prime minister. ""That would mean chaos for Britain, with weak Ed Miliband dancing to Alex Salmond's tune.""He said the ""only way to keep Britain together"" was to vote Conservative.Mr Salmond's latest comments come after Mr Miliband said the only people writing a future Labour Budget would be himself and shadow chancellor Ed Balls.Speaking in Clydebank on Monday, he added: ""It's not going to be Alex Salmond - not in a million years."""
2015-04-12,MPs criticise 'lack of EU debate',https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32045290,"The government's ""failure"" to let MPs debate EU legislation is ""deplorable"", a Parliamentary committee says.The European Scrutiny Committee said ministers had refused to schedule debates on issues such as free movement and the EU's Budget.It also said BBC coverage of EU matters should be ""improved substantially"".The government said the number of EU debates had doubled since 2009-10, while the BBC said its coverage was ""extensive and impartial"".The cross-party committee's role includes scrutinising EU documents and recommending the most important for debate in the House of Commons.Its report said in the period covering most of the 2014-15 financial year there were three debates on the floor of the House, compared with 12 in 2013-14.It also pointed out that not a single debate had taken place during a nine-month period, between 9 June 2014 and 9 March 2015.""The government's collective failure to schedule so many debates on EU documents over the past year is deplorable, and is a discourtesy to this committee and to all members of the House,"" the MPs said.Prime Minister David Cameron has sought to rally support from other EU leaders for his plans to curb welfare payments to European migrants ahead of a referendum on the UK's membership if he wins the general election.The committee said the government's ""cavalier"" approach was ""at odds with UK ministers' claims in their speeches across the EU about the role of national parliaments"".The Foreign Office said the government was committed to a ""strong EU scrutiny system that enables Parliament to hold it to account for the decisions taken in Brussels"".It added: ""We have made good on our commitment to raise standards by doubling the number of Europe debates on the floor of the House since 2009-10.""This government has also increased by around a fifth since 2010 the number of EU proposals that have been scrutinised and cleared by Parliament before being agreed in Brussels.""The committee has also been examining the BBC's coverage of European issues, taking evidence from director general Lord Hall and head of news James Harding earlier this month.During that appearance, Lord Hall said the desire for balanced output ""ran deep"" within the BBC and he believed that this was being achieved.Mr Harding said if the public was going to trust the BBC to report on politicians impartially it had to be clear that BBC journalists weren't ""asked by politicians to come and account for what they do and in effect do the bidding of those politicians"".But the committee said it was ""concerned about the manner in which the BBC treats EU issues"", calling for coverage to be ""improved substantially"".It suggested coverage did not reflect all sides of the debate on the European Union, and more analysis was needed. Its chairman, Conservative MP Sir William Cash, said the BBC had ""very particular obligations"" to be impartial and to ""educate and inform"".He added:  ""We do not believe this is currently being achieved in the context of the BBC's EU coverage.""A BBC spokesman said the corporation provided extensive and impartial coverage of European and Parliamentary issues, and it would be a breach of the corporation's independence if a committee of MPs instructed the BBC on its coverage."
2015-04-12,Lobbyists must 'conform' with rules,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32047992,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe woman in charge of the government's new register of lobbyists has said she expects the industry to ""conform"" with the statutory system. Speaking ahead of the register's launch, Alison White conceded a lot of lobbyists would not be listed on it.But she said her job was to make sure the rules were implemented and she would do so with ""extreme verve and vigour.""But one critic of the register said it was ""fake"" and full of ""loopholes"".Lobbyists are companies or individuals paid to influence government decisions.The coalition promised to introduce a statutory register of lobbyists when it came to power in 2010, and legislation was passed last year, with ministers saying the move would help clean up politics.However, the new register will only cover consultant lobbyists and will not apply to lobbyists working ""in-house"" for companies or organisations.A person or company will only need to be registered if they are contacting a government minister or permanent secretary in a government department - leading to criticism it will not come close to reflecting the scale or nature of lobbying that goes on across Whitehall.But Ms White, who is independent of the government, said her task was to implement the law as it stood not to question the powers she had been given. ""We are having something that has never been in place before,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""This is a statutory register. The industry tells me it is a professional industry. I expect them to conform with the legislation. It is my job to make sure they do so.""Ms White, who was appointed as the registrar of consultant lobbyists in September, acknowledged the register would not indicate different ""levels of lobbying"".""The legislation was quite narrowly drafted to address a particular issue, which was that it was not always particularly clear, when ministers were being lobbied, who the client of the lobbyist was. That is what the register was set up to do,"" she said.She added: ""This will give anyone who wishes to access the register the opportunity to be able to see who is lobbying and being paid for it and who their clients are. That is the main information the register will contain.""If a lobbyist sets out to influence government policy in some way, they would have to be registered. If they are not registered, then they would not be conforming. They have to go on the register before they lobby.""Ms White said last month that the register would not have any entries on its launch day but she had received more than ""20 expressions of interest"" about joining and companies and individuals might be required to sign up retrospectively.Potential registrants will be able to log on and create an account to file an ""information return"".But Tamasin Cave, from the Alliance for Lobbying Transparency coalition, said ""hardly anyone"" in the industry would be covered by the provisions of the new law. ""You have a huge commercial lobbying industry, and very few of them will have to sign up,"" she told Today.""The second flaw is that it won't show the interaction between lobbyists and government, and that is what a register is for.""It is to show the activity - who is discussing what with whom, but this shows nothing of this interaction. It is a fake register."""
2015-04-12,Car smoking ban MSP welcomes backing,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-south-scotland-32055226,"The Liberal Democrat MSP behind a bill to ban smoking in cars when children are present has welcomed the support of the Scottish government.South of Scotland MSP Jim Hume launched the members' bill in December.The government said it was ""very supportive"" of the principles of the bill, but changes could be needed to make it ""workable"".Motorists could potentially be fined £100 for breaching the rule if it becomes law.Mr Hume lodged draft proposals for a bill last May calling for a ban in Scotland on smoking in private vehicles when children under 18 were present.He said he was ""over the moon"" at the news the Scottish government would endorse the Smoking Prohibition (Children in Motor Vehicles) (Scotland) Bill.He said: ""With cross-party support and the support of many third sector organisations, there is every chance that this could be in place in the next year.""Eighty-four per cent of the 160 responses to my consultation were positive and people from across Scotland have expressed their support for the move.""The bill is about guaranteeing that children in Scotland can have the freedom to go on and lead healthy lives if they choose to.""I look forward to working with MSPs from all parties as the bill progresses.""Public Health Minister Maureen Watt said the Scottish government had considered including the measure in its Public Health Bill, but instead decided to support Mr Hume's proposals.She said: ""As with any bill, as it goes through the scrutiny process, there may be amendments and improvements to strengthen the legislation and ensure it is fit for purpose. ""But we believe that the underpinning principles are strong, and that is why I am pleased to support it.""Scottish Labour and a wide range of health organisations have backed his proposals.But the Scottish Conservatives have reservations about how the bill would work in practice.The party's health spokesman Jackson Carlaw said: ""While Scottish Conservatives support any moves which would protect young people from hazardous second hand smoke we have concerns as to how this would be enforced.""It would be a better use of resources to conduct a public awareness campaign similar to that which is being proposed by the government in Wales.""We will be watching this campaign in order to ascertain what lessons may be learned and what approaches may be adopted in Scotland.""Anti-smoking campaigners welcomed the Scottish government's backing for Mr Hume's bill.ASH Scotland's chief executive Sheila Duffy said: ""It is another public health initiative that can help Scotland move forward with its ambition to achieve a tobacco-free generation in 20 years' time.""It is popular with the public and will bring Scotland into line with upcoming legislation in England and Wales.""We believe it can be effectively enforced and that having the legislation focus on cars with children bypasses concerns over interference in people's private lives.""Jim Hume must be congratulated for taking the initiative on this proposal and for all the hard work he and his team have done to bring this important measure forward.""But Simon Clark, director of the smokers' group Forest, said the bill was ""legislation for legislation's sake"".He said: ""Smoking in cars carrying children is inconsiderate. The overwhelming majority of smokers know that and don't do it.""The very small number that do will carry on regardless because the law will be difficult, if not impossible, to enforce.""Education has to be better than legislation but the government prefers gesture politics and the big stick."""
2015-04-12,Candidate quits over UKIP MEP remark,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32038485,"A UKIP election candidate has quit the party over comments made by the party's only Scottish MEP about a Scottish government minister.Tim Wilson has decided not to stand in South Northamptonshire after David Coburn MEP compared Humza Yousaf to convicted terrorist Abu Hamza.Mr Coburn has apologised for the remarks, saying it was a ""joke"".A spokesman for UKIP said Mr Wilson had failed to emphasise local issues in his general election campaign.UKIP leader Nigel Farage said Mr Coburn's remarks were a ""joke in poor taste"" but he would not be taking any action against him.But Mr Wilson said he was disillusioned with the party over the ""racist jibes"" and has decided to stand down.He told BBC Scotland he was appalled by Mr Coburn's comments about Mr Yousaf and frustrated by the inaction of the party's leadership on the issue.  He said David Coburn had produced ""what I can only describe as an Islamaphobic insult, and that's simply not acceptable"".  Mr Wilson added: ""Of course he went on and apologised.  I think, frankly, that if you are in a position of power you have to be able to control what ideas emerge from your head and how they get to your mouth and, in fact, you shouldn't have those ideas in the first place.  ""But the real issue is that when Mr Farage was asked what he thought about this he dismissed this as a joke.  ""I don't think this is a joke. I think this is something very serious.  It may not be that this man intended to cause offence but we aren't interested in what his intentions are.  We are interested in the effect what he says has on other people and the effect is catastrophic, it's appalling and I've resigned.""In his resignation letter, Mr Wilson said he had been ""systematically gagged by the party whip"" and forbidden to speak about Islam favourably. A spokesman for UKIP said Mr Wilson had failed to put more emphasis on local issues in his campaign.He said: ""Whilst we had initially been optimistic about Tim Wilson's abilities as a candidate, it became obvious in recent weeks that he was out of his depth in representing our party in the way we would expect. ""Mr Wilson had clearly misunderstood the expectations that UKIP place on all of its candidates. Principal amongst those is focusing on issues that are relevant to local voters. UKIP put huge emphasis on local issues and Mr Wilson was unwilling to follow UKIP guidelines in this respect.""Last week MSPs at the Scottish Parliament unanimously condemned the remarks made by Mr Coburn during a newspaper interview.MSPs were debating a motion celebrating Scotland's diverse communities.The president of the European Parliament, Martin Schulz, condemned the remarks, saying they were ""not worthy of any elected member"". But a spokesman for the president said he could not act on remarks made outside parliament.The move comes just days after another candidate, Jonathan Stanley, quit in protest at the ""racist filth"" in UKIP. Mr Stanley, who was due to stand in the Cumbrian seat of Westmorland and Lonsdale, was the party's former head of policy in Scotland."

2015-04-12,Manifesto watch,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-29642613,"Political parties are putting together their manifestos for May's general election. Here's a guide to where they currently stand on the issues voters say they care about most (according to pollsters IPSOS Mori).ImmigrationConservatives:  David Cameron wants to make migrants wait four years before they can claim certain benefits, such as tax credits, Universal Credit, or get access to social housing. He wants to stop migrants from claiming child benefit for dependents living outside the UK, and remove those that have failed to find work after six months. Mr Cameron has promised to put reform of EU free movement rules at the heart of his renegotiation of Britain's relationship with the EU. He has ruled out a temporary cap on migrant numbers or an ""emergency brake"" on EU freedom of movement rules - ideas both mooted in recent months, saying this would be less ""effective"" than reducing the incentives for people to come to the UK. The party has a continuing goal to bring net immigration down to below 100,000 people a year (it currently stands at 243,000).Labour: ""Stronger"" border controls to tackle illegal immigration with ""proper"" entry and exit checks. ""Smarter"" targets to reduce low-skilled migration but ensure university students and high-skilled workers are not deterred. Employment agencies who only recruit abroad will be outlawed while the fines for employing illegal immigrants will be increased.Lib Dems: Reintroduce exit checks at borders, so the government can identify people who are overstaying their visa. Will require all new claimants for Jobseekers Allowance to have their English language skills assessed, with JSA then being conditional on attending language courses for those whose English is poor. Ensure that EU migrants have to ""earn"" their entitlement to benefits.SNP: Allow the devolved government to have control over immigration to Scotland, and introduce a Canadian-style earned citizenship system to attract highly-skilled immigrants.Plaid Cymru: Oppose a points-based system. Support the right of asylum seekers to work in Wales while they wait for status decisions to be made. Lobby the Westminster government to ensure that they shut ""detention"" centres.UKIP: Introduce an Australian-style points policy, used to select migrants with the skills and attributes needed to work in the country - covering people from inside and outside the EU. Bring net immigration down to 50,000 people a year. Priority lanes for UK passport holders. Increase UK border staff by 2,500. Tougher English language tests for migrants seeking permanent residence. Opt out of the Dublin treaty to allow the UK to return asylum seekers to other EU countries without considering their claim. Anyone who currently has the legal right to live, work, or study in the UK would not face deportation in the event of the country's withdrawal from the EU.Greens:  Progressively reduce UK immigration controls. Migrants illegally in the UK for over five years will be allowed to remain unless they pose a serious danger to public safety. More legal rights for asylum seekers.Taxes and the economyConservatives: Eradicate the deficit by 2018 and secure an overall budget surplus by 2019-20. Achieve this by spending cuts, not tax rises, while raising NHS spending. An income tax cut for 30 million people by 2020. Tax would start to kick in at £12,500 a year, instead of £10,500. This will cost £5.6bn. The higher tax rate, 40%, would start at £50,000 instead of £41,900, again by 2020, at a cost of £1.6bn. This will be paid for through £25bn in additional spending cuts and economic growth. No increases in VAT.Labour: Get the current budget into surplus and the national debt falling ""as soon as possible in the next parliament"". No additional borrowing for new spending. Reintroduce the 50p top rate of income tax for earnings over £150,000.  Cut income tax for 24 million people by bringing back the 10p rate, paid for by scrapping the Married Couples' Tax Allowance. Bring in a ""mansion tax"" on properties worth over £2m, to raise £1.2bn. A tax on bankers' bonuses. A 5% pay cut for every government minister. Push for UK overseas territories to be put on an international blacklist if they refuse to co-operate with a drive against tax avoidance. No increases in VAT or National Insurance contributions.Lib Dems: Raise the personal allowance - the point at which you start paying income tax - to £11,000 in April 2016 and then to £12,500 by 2020. ""Strict new fiscal rules"" to ensure the deficit has gone by April 2018, with the wealthy contributing the most. The Lib Dems invented the ""mansion tax"" but in contrast to Labour have set out how it would operate - along similar lines to council tax bands. There are also Lib Dem plans to increase capital gains tax - paid on profits from second homes or shares - from 28% to 35%. Impose an additional 8% rate of corporation tax on UK banks to raise an extra £1bn a year to help pay off the deficit.SNP: Oppose UK plans in the Infrastructure Bill which will allow oil and gas drilling and hydraulic fracturing beneath people's homes without consent. Invest in offshore wind farming. Support an international bank tax and limits to industry bonuses.Plaid Cymru: Build a Green Skills Construction College, specialising in green energy. Establish a publicly-owned energy company. Establish a publicly-owned Bank of Wales business investment bank. Enforce a living wage. Give devolved nations an equal say in institutions that affect everyone's lives, such as the Bank of England.UKIP: Increase the personal allowance to the level of full-time minimum wage earnings, about £13,500, by 2020. Abolish inheritance tax. Introduce a 35% income tax rate between £42,285 and £55,000, at which point the 40% rate becomes payable. Set up a Treasury Commission to design a turnover tax on large businesses. Cut foreign aid budget by £9bn a year. Scrap HS2. Save £8bn a year in membership fees by leaving the EU.  Lower the VAT rate charged on restorations to listed buildings.Greens: People earning more than £100,000 a year would pay 50% income tax. Wealth tax of 1% to 2% on people worth £3m or more. Renationalise the railways and energy companies. Scrap HS2. Allow councils to impose extra business rates on out-of-town supermarkets to fund small local businesses. Crackdown on tax avoidance by multinationals. Allow ""the current dependence on economic growth to cease, and allow zero or negative growth to be feasible without individual hardship"". Commit Britain to a ""zero carbon"" future. Cut rail and bus fares by an average of 10%. Enforce a cap on bankers' bonuses.The NHSConservatives:  Chancellor George Osborne says he will put an extra £2bn into frontline health services across the UK, which he described as a ""down payment"" on a plan drawn up by NHS bosses calling for an extra £8bn a year above inflation by 2020. In England, everyone would be able to see a GP seven days a week by 2020. Recruit 5,000 more doctors.Labour:  Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said Labour would commit an extra £2.5bn a year above Mr Osborne's plan. The money will come from three sources - a new ""mansion"" tax, clamping down on tax avoidance by big corporations and a new tax on tobacco companies. Patients in England would get a GP appointment within 48 hours and would not have to wait longer than a week for cancer tests and results. Scrap the Health and Social Care Act and end ""creeping privatisation"" of the NHS.  Integrate health and social care services into a system of ""whole-person care"". Give greater priority to mental health services. Replace the Cancer Drugs Fund in England when it runs out in 2016 with a £330m fund to improve access to innovative cancer drugs, surgery and radiotherapy. Recruit 5,000 more healthcare workers to help patients stay in their homes and introduce new safety checks to identify people at risk of hospitalisation. Prioritise child mental health by increasing the proportion of the mental health budget spent on children.Lib Dems: An extra £1bn for the NHS every year, to be funded by - amongst other things - making higher earners pay more tax on their shares. Half of this will go towards mental health. Ensure that spending on the NHS rises in line with growth in the economy. People who need therapy for conditions such as depression will be guaranteed treatment within 18 weeks. For young patients experiencing psychosis for the first time treatment will be provided within two weeks of being referred by a GP. This is all going to happen from April, with more mental health targets to follow if the Lib Dems return to government. Wants a cross-party review of the future of NHS funding.SNP: Reduce the number of senior managers in the NHS by 25% over the next parliament. Streamline the work of health boards. Real terms increases in year-on-year NHS spending.Plaid Cymru: Recruit 1,000 extra doctors to the Welsh NHS over two terms of a Plaid government. Offer financial incentives for recruiting doctors to areas and specialisms where there are, or are predicted to be, shortages. Encourage innovation and attract more research funding, in part by increasing research and development funding as government finance allows. Improve training for postgraduate doctors and stop them being used to ""plug gaps"" in staff rotas. More recruitment from within the EU to fill vacancies and using international doctors to staff the NHS while a new generation of Welsh doctors are trained.UKIP: An extra £3bn per year in NHS funding paid for by quitting the EU and through ""middle management"" cuts. Keep NHS free at the point of delivery. Stop any further use of PFI, and encourage local authorities to buy out their PFI contracts early where it is affordable to do so. Ensure all visitors and migrants who have been here for fewer than five years have NHS-approved medical insurance as a condition of entry to UK, with £200m of the £2bn saved to be spent on ending hospital parking charges in England. Bring back state-enrolled nurses and return powers to matrons. Monitor and Care Quality Commission to be replaced with elected county health boards. Stop spending £90m a year on gastric band and breast enhancement operations.Greens: Funding to be diverted away from centralised facilities towards community healthcare, illness prevention and health promotion.  Stop privatisation. Abolish prescription charges. Dedicated NHS Tax to go direct to the health service. Ban proactive recruitment of non-British NHS staff from overseas. A complete ban on the promotion of tobacco and alcohol products, including sponsorship.Security, defence and foreign affairsConservatives: Hold a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU by 2017, after negotiating the return of some powers from Brussels. Protect foreign aid budget. Replace Trident.Labour:  Push for reform of European Union and prevent Britain from ""sleepwalking"" towards exit. Commit in law to holding a Strategic Defence and Security Review every 5 years. Outlaw discrimination and abuse of Armed Forces personnel.Lib Dems: Campaign to reduce the number of Trident nuclear submarines. Push for greater European Union efficiency. SNP: Oppose nuclear weapons and push for removal of Trident submarines from Scotland. In 2010, proposed a Scottish Centre for Reconciliation and Conflict Resolution, to promote peaceful alternatives to armed conflict. Maintain 0.7% commitment to foreign aid. Enhanced role for Scotland within the UK in Europe, particularly in fisheries policy.Plaid Cymru: Honour commitment of 0.7% of budget used for foreign aid. Campaign for cancellation of developing countries' debts. Support the Fair Trade movement. Support the 'Tobin' or 'Robin hood' tax as a means of encouraging more responsibility and stability in the global markets. Reform the IMF and World Bank in order to improve regulation and accountability. Continue membership of the EU, but campaign for democratic reform. Support minority nations and minority language speakers around the world. Pass a Military Wellbeing Act to promote and safeguard the physical and mental health and wellbeing of military personnel.UKIP:  Leave the European Union. Remove the passports of any person who has gone to fight for a terrorist organisation and deport anyone who has committed a terrorist act. Cut foreign aid budget by £9bn. Create a Veterans Department to look after the interests of ex-service men and women.Greens: Referendum on Britain's EU membership. Want reform of EU to hand powers back to local communities. Boost overseas aid to 1% of GDP within 10 years. Scrap Britain's nuclear weapons. Take the UK out of NATO unilaterally. End the so-called ""special relationship"" between the UK and the US.  Stop EU-US free trade deal TTIP. JobsConservatives: Create three million apprenticeships to be paid for by benefit cuts.Labour: Guarantee a job for under 25s unemployed for over a year and adults unemployed for more than two years. As many young people to go on an apprenticeship as currently go to university by 2025. Create a million new high technology, green jobs by 2025. Ban ""exploitative"" zero hour contracts.Lib Dems: An extra £1 an hour for the lowest paid apprentices. Campaign to create a million more jobs.SNP: Introduce gender quotas on public boards. Living wage ""a central priority"" in all Scottish government contracts. Continue the 'small business bonus'.Plaid Cymru: Provide rates relief for small businesses. Increase the number and value of contracts from Welsh public bodies that go to firms within Wales.UKIP: Allow firms to offer jobs to British workers first ""without the fear of being sued for discrimination"".Greens: A national energy conservation scheme to create thousands of new jobs. The party wants to create ""sustainable jobs"" and promotes more local production of food and goods.Education Conservatives: Protect England's schools budget - from reception entry at age four or five to the end of GCSEs at 16 - in cash terms although funding per pupil will not keep pace with inflation. Pre-school and post 16 education not ring fenced. Convert up to 3,500 more schools judged by Ofsted to ""require improvement"" into academies. ""War on illiteracy and innumeracy"". State primary schools in England that repeatedly failed to have a proportion of year-six pupil pass times tables and writing tests be forced to become academies, or have sponsorship replaced if already an academy. Opposed to giving votes to 16 and 17-year-olds for UK-wide general elections and local elections in England.Labour:  Increase the overall education budget in England, including schools, nurseries, Sure Start and provision for 16-to 18-year-olds, by at least the rate of inflation, although per-pupil funding is not specifically protected, meaning some of the increase will be eaten up by rising pupil numbers. Parents of primary school children would be guaranteed childcare from 8am to 6pm. The amount of free childcare for three and four year olds would be increased from 15 to 25 hours a week. Compulsory sex and relationship education in all schools. Refuse to grant business rate relief to independent schools unless they can show a ""meaningful impact"" on state schools through a new School Partnership Standard, for example by lending teaching staff or assisting in university admissions procedures. Committed to extending the franchise to 16 and 17-year-olds in elections across the UK. Double the number of Sure Start childcare places to more than 118,000. Tighten up the rules on primary school class sizes to ensure they do not have more than 30 pupils.Lib Dems: Protect the education budget from cuts. Guarantee qualified teachers and a core curriculum set by independent experts, as well as compulsory sex education, in all state schools including academies and free schools. More money for disadvantaged school children and free childcare for all two year olds. A two-thirds discount on all local bus fares for young people aged 16-21. Supports lowering the voting age to 16 in all UK elections.SNP: Guaranteed free 30 hours of childcare a week for three and four-year-olds in Scotland, up from 16 hours. Maintain lack of tuition fees at Scottish universities, and offer financial support in grants and loans to students. Continue to build and refurbish schools. Lower voting age to 16 in all UK elections.Plaid Cymru: Introduce a compulsory modern foreign language GCSE in secondary schools and the teaching of modern foreign languages in primary schools. Look at ways to strengthen the teaching of Welsh history and culture. Oppose foundation schools, academies and free schools. Look at moving from a per-pupil funding mechanism to a funding model based on the catchment area. Will not support any further increases in tuition fees for higher education students, and will seek the abolition of tuition fees as and when public finances allow. Supports lowering the voting age to 16 for elections to the Welsh Assembly and the UK Parliament.UKIP: More grammar schools. Scrap sex education for children aged under seven. Scrap tuition fees for students from poorer backgrounds who take degree courses in the sciences, technology, maths or engineering. Greater emphasis on vocational education with new Apprenticeship Qualification Option. School governing boards must be made up of at least 30% parents of children at the school. Allow universities to charge same amount for EU students as non-EU students.Greens: End performance related pay for teachers. Replace Ofsted with an independent National Council for Educational Excellence. Bring Free Schools and Academies into local authority control.

Withdraw Jobseeker's Allowance from young people after six months unless they take part in ""community projects"". And 18 to 21-year-olds wouldn't be entitled to housing benefit. Ban on zero-hours contracts which stop people getting work elsewhere. Raise the personal allowance - the point at which you start paying income tax - to £11,000 in April 2016 and then to £12,500 by 2020, which means that if you work on minimum wage for 30 hours you will pay no income tax. Young people out of work, education or training for six months will have to do unpaid community work to get benefits. This will apply to about 50,000 18 to 21-year-olds. Universal benefits for pensioners, such as free bus passes, TV licences for the over 75s and the winter fuel allowance. will once again be protected. Labour: Freeze energy prices until 2017. Increase in the minimum wage from £6.50-an-hour to £8-an-hour by 2020. Rises in child benefit capped at 1% for the first two years of the next parliament. Winter fuel allowance would be withdrawn from the wealthiest pensioners. Repeal what the government calls the spare room subsidy, dubbed the ""bedroom tax"" by Labour.  A million interest-free loans to help people insulate their homes. Rail fares would be capped. Double the amount of paid paternity leave available to new fathers from two to four weeks, and increase statutory paternity pay to £260 a week.Lib Dems: Raise the personal allowance - the point at which you start paying income tax - to £11,000 in April 2016 and then to £12,500 by 2020 (the Conservatives are promising the same thing). Nick Clegg has said he would not accept Conservative plans to freeze working-age benefits without taxing the rich too. He hasn't said he would block welfare cuts altogether. Withdraw eligibility for the Winter Fuel Payment and free TV Licence from pensioners on the 40% rate of income tax. A ""yellow card"" system to deal with benefit claimants breaking the rules, rather than imposing sanctions without warning.SNP: Oppose cuts to in-work benefits. Support moves to extend paternity leave. Introduce a maximum combined withdrawal rate for benefits and reforms to employment support allowance and cold weather payments. Protect policies such as concessionary travel for older Scots.Plaid Cymru: Move away from complex and expensive means testing for child-related benefits. Continue to campaign for the introduction of a living pension during the period of the next parliament for those aged 80 and over. UKIP: Only pay child benefit for the first two children for new claimants. Increase the Carers' Allowance to the same level as Jobseekers' Allowance (JSA) and pay a higher rate of JSA if you've been in work and already made tax and National Insurance contributions. Prevent anyone taking up permanent residence in Britain unless they're able to support themselves and any dependents they bring with them for at least five years and stop them receiving benefits. Stop paying child benefit for children who don't live in Britain. Scrap what UKIP calls the ""detested bedroom tax"". Boost ""credit unions"".Greens: The party backs a Citizen's Income, a fixed amount of £72 income a week to be paid to every individual, whether they are in work or not, to be funded by higher taxes on the better off and green levies.  But in the short-term it would increase the minimum wage to £10 by 2020. Ban zero hours contracts. Axe the ""bedroom tax"". Abolish the work capability assessment and restore the level of the former disability living allowance. Scrap the government's welfare cap, which limits the maximum amount a household can claim annually to £26,000 a year."

2015-04-12,Elephant trap?,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32047998,"The campaign has not even got under way, yet in the space of a couple of hours we have now been treated to not only one election pledge, but to two. The prime minister ruled out raising VAT if re-elected - while Labour said National Insurance contributions wouldn't go up.Usually politicians fudge the question of tax rises.  When he was leader of the opposition David Cameron himself said ""we have no need to raise taxes"" - before hiking up VAT after polling day.Famously, John Major said he had ""no plans"" to put up the sales tax -  before his chancellor did just that.And when he appeared in front of the cross-party Treasury committee of MPs on Tuesday, the current chancellor seemed to be continuing that tradition.  Under repeated questioning, George Osborne said: ""The policies we have do not involve a VAT rise.""That formulation appeared to give him not so much wriggle room, but an entire wriggle mansion.Labour assumed their campaign warning of further VAT rises to come under the Tories was very much on the money.But George Osborne's allies are suggesting privately that he had, in fact, been walking Ed Miliband to the edge of an elephant trap, then beckoning the prime minister to push the opposition leader in.Ed Miliband's strategists fully expected Mr Cameron to repeat the chancellor's obfuscation on tax at the final Prime Minister's Questions of this Parliament. They would then have expanded on the theme, inviting the prime minister to answer other difficult questions - then say he wasn't being straight with the British people for avoiding them.But the Labour leader was completely wrong-footed when first the prime minister said he would rule out a VAT rise and then counter-punched, inquiring if Labour would now rule out an increase in National Insurance contributions.Ed Miliband dodged the question and what could have been downbeat Conservative benches, uneasy over the prime minister's announcement this week of his retirement plans, were given something to cheer.The reason Ed Miliband didn't respond is because he was holding the National Insurance pledge back for Labour's manifesto.But that soon became unsustainable - so the other Ed, the shadow chancellor Ed Balls, had to undertake a hasty round of the TV studios to do just that.When I spoke to him mid-tour, he put on a brave face. His view was that George Osborne, having raised VAT from 17.5% to 20%, wanted to give the issue a low profile - whereas the prime minister had now made the mistake of putting it centre stage. And he believed David Cameron's promise would be judged against his past VAT-raising performance.He defended Ed Miliband's reluctance to talk about National Insurance as he felt it would have been ""inappropriate"" to announce Labour tax policy at PMQs.So the prime minister - always a better tactician than strategist - can at least satisfy himself that he smoked Labour out on NI and disrupted at least one entry in their election campaign grid.But the exchange actually raised more questions than it answered.If the main parties are ruling out further potential sources of revenue, but still committing themselves to eradicating a £90bn black hole in the public finances, will they now be under more pressure during the election campaign to spell out in much greater detail exactly what they intend to cut?"
2015-04-12,Who's next?,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32031343,"David Cameron's declaration that he will not seek a third term in office if he retains power in May has immediately stoked interest in who might fill his shoes when he's gone. Here are the likely - and perhaps less obvious - possibilities.Claim? As chancellor of the exchequer he's the man in charge of the purse strings and master strategist - and reportedly the PM's favourite to succeed him, although he hasn't said as much. Mr Cameron's right-hand man has had an image makeover of late, with a new haircut and a diet to shed some pounds. And he has seemingly recovered from his ""omnishambles"" Budget in 2012, with his latest - and last Budget - of the parliament giving the Tories a lead in some polls. He's said to be well liked among Conservative cabinet ministers and backbench MPs, whose support is vital for any candidate wanting to take on the party leadership. He shas some work to do among grassroots Tory members, however, coming fifth in ConservativeHome's latest online poll of party members on future leaders.Latest odds: 10/1 (according to William Hill)What's he said? ""The prime minister leads a strong team but what you see from him is answering a direct question with a direct answer. I think that's really refreshing. He says he's going to serve that full five years so the real question facing the country now is do you want the strong leadership of David Cameron that's delivering zero inflation and record jobs or do you want the chaos and incompetence of Ed Miliband.""Claim? The longest-serving home secretary in 50 years, she is only the second Conservative woman to secure one of the top four jobs in government. In her role, she has talked tough on immigration and crime and taken on the Police Federation. And she is popular with Tory activists, consistently occupying either first or second place in ConservativeHome's online polls on future party leaders. There have long been claims of Mrs May positioning herself for the top job, with reported tensions between her and the prime minister. Critics say she lacks charisma and micro-manages - while some cannot forget her coining the now infamous ""nasty party"" phrase at a Tory conference in 2002, but supporters say she is a formidable operator, and have dubbed her Britain's Angela Merkel. Latest odds: 9/2What's she said? ""My view is very simple, David Cameron is a first class leader of the party and a first class prime minister and I hope he is going to be doing that for a very long time."" (Desert Island discs, 23 November 2014)Claim? The blonde bombshell and mayor of London who can seemingly reach voters that others in the party cannot. Casting aside a rather chequered past he steered the capital through the 2012 Olympics, launched the successful and popular ""Boris bikes"" and got rid of London's ""bendy buses"" in favour of the new Routemaster double deckers. Mr Johnson hopes to revive his Westminster parliamentary career at the general election. He has been tipped by many to take the helm of the Conservative Party, and has not discouraged the idea. Like Theresa May, he is also a favourite among the grassroots of the party, pipping her to the top spot in ConservativeHome's latest poll of party members on future leaders. (he's ahead by 2 points). Critics say the gaffe-prone politician is not the right man for the job, but his supporters point to his wide-spread appeal.Latest odds: 9/4What's he said? ""I think what David Cameron is saying is banal and obvious. There has already been a leader of the Conservative Party for ten years and he's done an outstanding job. What he's saying now is that he wants to serve through to 2020 and that is frankly what we need him to do... five more years is what this country needs. I'm not entirely certain I see what the story is. He was asked a straight question, are you going to serve a third term like Mrs Thatcher or Tony Blair and he said no, because he thinks that ten years on top of British politics is an incredibly long time.""Claim? A self-made millionaire and devotee of Margaret Thatcher, he is regarded as one of the Conservatives' fastest-rising stars. The Treasury minister-turned-culture secretary became the first of the 2010 intake of MPs to reach cabinet level, and the first Asian male Conservative cabinet minister. He's currently polling well among the Conservative grassroots, who voted him third most preferable leader in ConservativeHome's latest online future leader poll. David Cameron recently said he wants to see a British Asian prime minister in his lifetime.Latest odds: 12/1Claim? Currently holding one of the four great offices of state - foreign secretary - Mr Hammond's name has often cropped up whenever talk of leadership contenders has emerged. He has built up an impressive CV in government since the Conservatives came to power in 2010, being first awarded the job of transport secretary before his promotion to defence secretary where he stayed for three years. He's regarded by many commentators as being a potential candidate for the Tory right. He seems to have work to do among party activists, scoring only 4% in ConservativeHome's future leader poll.Latest odds: 12/1"
2015-04-12,Cereal number,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-magazine-monitor-31962592,"David Cameron has declared he won't seek a third term as prime minister, citing an advertising slogan for Shredded Wheat used in the UK more than 30 years ago. What's its enduring power, asks Justin Parkinson.The hotel kitchen staff are in disbelief. Someone in room 147 has ordered three Shredded Wheat. The maid transports them upstairs to find England cricketer Ian Botham waiting at a table, dressed in full whites.The maid leaves. Botham hides one of the Shredded Wheat under a napkin and winks to camera. Cue music, as the slogan ""Shredded Wheat. Bet you can't eat three"" appears.This advert and others featuring football manager Brian Clough and the actor Richard Kiel, who played Jaws in James Bond films, have not run for some time. Nestle, which owns the brand, says the last probably aired in 1984.But their message seems to have waned little. Telling the BBC he would only serve a limited time in Downing Street, David Cameron said: ""Terms are like Shredded Wheat - two are wonderful but three might just be too many.""The prime minister's reprise was unlikely to be accidental, says Thayne Forbes, joint managing director of the brand-valuation company Intangible Business. ""Everybody would empathise with the view that three Shredded Wheat would probably be too much,"" he says. ""The slogan suggests people shouldn't overdo it. It sounds modest and reasoned.""As marketing goes, it might seem counter-intuitive, as it discourages excessive consumption. But it also sounds honest and unexploitative.Other advertising slogans and themes are in wide use in public and political discourse. Examples include Marmite being a by-word for divisiveness - a ""Marmite person"" is either loved or hated. Cameron has twice referred to Ronseal - the woodcare product that does ""exactly what it says on the tin"". But Shredded Wheat, its best-known slogan having lain dormant for so long, appears to be used less often. The cereal, created in the US in the 1890s, has long been sold as good for the evolving British lifestyle. A newspaper advert in 1902 described it as ""a relief from the monotony of everlasting porridge"", while, by 1943, it was ""an ideal food for all war workers"". The 1980s saw an emphasis on ""simple, honest goodness"", while, in the 2000s, its long heritage and reliability was promoted.""It's a good association for Cameron,"" says Forbes. ""He must have been brought up on it, like lots of other people. It will be great marketing for Shredded Wheat to have the slogan used after so many years, too.""Subscribe to the BBC News Magazine's email newsletter to get articles sent to your inbox"
2015-04-12,Are you 'cosmopolitan'?,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32021853,"The rise of UKIP heralds the emergence of a new divide in British politics, with cosmopolitan voters on one side and non-cosmopolitan ones on the other, argues Jeremy Cliffe.We hear a lot about UKIP these days. The party stole the show at the local and European elections last year, then again in the autumn when it lured two Conservative MPs to defect.  In the past weeks alone there have been three much-discussed television programmes about the party: ""Meet the Ukippers"", ""Farage Fans and UKIP Lovers"" and ""100 Days of UKIP"". At the upcoming general election the party will probably increase its share of seats in Westminster - and will certainly affect the results in dozens of other constituencies by taking votes from the other parties. But ask some of those academics who have been watching UKIP's rise, and they will tell you that it is just one part of a bigger story. We are all used to the left-right divide in politics: a spectrum of different views on how much the government should tax, spend, regulate and otherwise intervene in the economy. But according to Dr Rob Ford of Manchester University, UKIP exists on a different axis, one to do with cultural rather than economic matters. This new political scale is ever more prominent in British political life.Radio 4's Analysis programmeOn the one end of it is what you might call a ""cosmopolitan"" philosophy: a relaxed, liberal attitude to issues concerning national identity (like immigration) and to questions of morality and lifestyle (like gay marriage). On the other end is a ""non-cosmopolitan"" outlook: more nationalist, socially conservative and less comfortable with social change, or in other words the ideological stance often associated with typical UKIP voters. This divide cuts across the left-right scale: there are cosmopolitan and non-cosmopolitan voters in both the Conservative and the Labour camps, which is why UKIP takes support from both.Lots of things are making this cosmopolitanism divide more important. One is that the old class-based, ideological conflict between left and right has declined. Dr James Tilley of Oxford University argues that politicians are partly to blame. The economic philosophies of the Conservative and Labour parties are so similar, he argues, that other, cultural issues are becoming more important. Another factor is the growing gap between the generations: the difference in outlook between the cosmopolitan young and less cosmopolitan, older voters is greater than it was in the past (partly due to the recent rise in levels of university education, which tend to correlate with liberal views). This trend presents the established parties with some difficult questions. As Dr Ford puts it, they ""have to try and deal with this rising value divide, particularly now that UKIP has mobilised it into the political debate."" ""They have to make a move,"" he adds, ""but any move that they make risks making their position worse with one or the other of these groups of voters."" Sound too cosmopolitan, and the parties risk losing supporters to UKIP. Try to ""out-UKIP UKIP"", and they could alienate their younger, more socially liberal supporters. So both are doing the political splits, trying to reconcile the cosmopolitans within their ranks with the non-cosmopolitans. Witness the tortuous attempts by Ed Miliband to sound tough on immigration without sounding too tough. Witness, too, the recent struggles of David Cameron to persuade social conservatives in his party that gay marriage can be an innately conservative institution. In the long-term, this divide will become less problematic. That is because over the years the country will tilt towards the cosmopolitan end of this new spectrum. So says Penny Young of NatCen, the research organisation that conducts the extensive British Social Attitudes survey. Various demographic factors explain this trend. The country as a whole is becoming more accepting of same-sex relationships. Younger voters are more relaxed about things like immigration and national identity than were previous generations when they were young, suggesting that the overall population will tilt in an internationalist direction over time. And ever more parts of the country are acquiring the ethnic and social diversity once confined to the inner cities, a trend that generally makes people more comfortable with immigration. According to Dr Ford the question is therefore: how should the main political parties navigate this period of transition? It would be wrong to simply abandon the swathes of voters at the less cosmopolitan end of the scale; voters who are usually older and more isolated than the average member of the population.Yet the politicians do need to adapt to the changing attitudes of British society and be honest with voters rather than pandering to views that, deep down, they do not share. This quandary may not decide the upcoming general election, but in the established parties savvy strategists with an eye to elections in 2020 and beyond are grappling with it nonetheless. That is a wise move."
2015-04-12,Dudley debate,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32015334,"I met Afzal Amin for the first time on Friday, but I already knew who he was. In Dudley North, the seat he was selected by the Conservatives to fight in the general election, Mr Amin had become hard to avoid. When I first looked at the local newspaper online, the pages were surrounded by ""Amin"" logos in the preferred Tory shade of blue.Not long after we met, he asked me to pose for a photo, snapped by one of his campaign team, and doubtless rapidly tweeted out to followers of the would-be MP.Perhaps no surprise that the man running such a disciplined operation has served in the army and been to Sandhurst. That was very much the message he delivered on Friday, as he addressed school and college pupils at a hustings in Dudley which I'd been invited to chair.There was combative debate, too, not least with his Labour rival, the MP Ian Austin. Both men knew the Dudley contest was critical for their respective parties; Ian Austin held the seat by just over 600 votes in 2010. Just as David Cameron was denied a majority by failing to take seats like this one, so Ed Miliband is unlikely to be in No 10 if Labour loses Dudley North.He was self-confident and fluent. The only obvious mis-step came right at the end, when he interrupted Vicky Duckworth, the Green candidate for the neighbouring seat. She expressed the opinion that politics often seemed to be about men shouting at each other; Mr Amin complained she was engaging in gender bias.A few weeks ago, one Conservative MP who knows him well and respects his talents, said Afzal Amin had warned him of the risks of over-confidence. He thought he risked running before he could walk.Well, he stumbled badly this weekend. Whatever the purpose of his contacts with the English Defence League - and he strongly disputes claims that he wanted them to hold a protest that would then be called off, for which he could then take the credit - the exposure has damaged him and, potentially, the prospects of his party re-taking the seat.In February, the EDL staged a rally against plans for a new mosque in the town. As the Mail on Sunday story makes clear, Afzal Amin pleaded with them beforehand not to hold that demonstration; but it went ahead anyway. It's what happened subsequently which will feature in Tuesday's disciplinary hearing.Over the weekend, I put his defence to a very senior Conservative source - that this was an attempt to broker a compromise in order to bring together a divided community. The arch response: Dudley isn't Kandahar.Nor do I think from my visits to the town, where I'm going to be based for the general election, will people in Dudley appreciate being painted as somewhere riven by racial discord.True, Dudley was the scene of one of England's earliest race riots. But that was in 1962. Although the controversy over replacing the mosque - currently in a converted school and inadequate for the numbers who want to worship there - has been running for a decade, community relations are generally good. Even those who don't want a new mosque didn't want the EDL protestors - nor to be fair the anti-fascist counter-demonstrators who followed them.As for the Conservative Party, the view of the national leadership is that you don't collaborate with the EDL. Not least because the Tories are still struggling to bury some historic baggage in the Black Country: Enoch Powell was an MP in Wolverhampton when he delivered his Rivers of Blood speech about immigration in 1968.Four years before that, there was the notorious election in Smethwick which the Conservatives were accused of winning by wooing white voters with an offensive rhyme suggesting who'd they'd get as a neighbour if they voted Labour. Afzal Amin grew up in Smethwick so he should be aware of that history. He was, until his suspension on Saturday, one of about 17% of Conservative parliamentary candidates who are not white. The party is proud of that, but it's still struggling to translate that into votes.Afzal Amin may believe that he can persuade the party to lift the suspension when he meets party officials on Tuesday. I have my doubts. Even if they accept his defence, will the other parties be so charitable? The allegations would follow him on the campaign trail, and make planned visits by cabinet ministers next to impossible.On Friday, just before the hustings in Dudley began, Afzal Amin gave me his business card. It introduces him as 'prospective member of Parliament Dudley North'. I think I'll keep it; it could yet become a collector's item."

2015-04-13,Bid to change Speaker election rules,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32061097,"A last-minute bid to change the way the Speaker of the House of Commons is elected is to be debated by MPs.Labour criticised the government motion, to be debated on the final day before the dissolution of Parliament, saying the Conservatives were ""trying to play politics with the speakership"".Under the proposals, a secret ballot would decide whether there should be a contested election for the post.MPs currently have to file through the division lobbies to cast their vote.This means it is clear who does or does not back the incumbent as Speaker.Labour's shadow leader of the Commons Angela Eagle raised the party's concerns in the House on Wednesday evening, questioning whether the motion was within parliamentary rules.Current Speaker John Bercow is - technically - one of them, but many Tory MPs have never liked him.They resent his personal style and some believe he is far from impartial in the way he conducts business in the Commons.Attempts by some to force a vote on his resumption as Speaker in 2010 came to nothing. There have been the occasional measured jibes at him from the prime minister. Other Tories reportedly went much further and formed a group whose members had all been reprimanded by him. But the Speaker is a reformer who believes passionately that the people who elect the members, and pay the bills, should come first.The last act of the coalition looks like being an attempt to unseat him. And they are very serious about it.One Tory MP fighting an important marginal seat had been cleared by his party to be away from Parliament but he is now staying for the vote, such is the importance of it.She told Deputy Speaker Lindsay Hoyle: ""It's just come to my attention that the government has tabled a motion for debate on the final day of this Parliament, with no notice whatsoever to myself as shadow leader of the House, proposing changes to the way in which the Speaker of this House is elected.""Procedural matters in this House, with no consultation with the opposition, no consultation with the chair of the committee itself, for debate in only one hour tomorrow.""Mr Hoyle said the motion had been ""rightly or wrongly"" agreed to on Tuesday, saying that ""business of the House is decided by the government, not by the chair.""A spokesman for Commons Leader William Hague said the motion had been tabled as a free hour had opened up in Thursday's business after the House of Lords approved the Modern Slavery Bill.The proposed change would apply when a Speaker wishes to continue in the post after a general election.Under the current rules, if the Speaker's re-appointment is objected to, a division is held, with MPs choosing to back or oppose the Speaker in the division lobbies.The replacement of this method with a secret ballot was suggested in 2010 by a committee of MPs, which said the public method ""can be seen as a deterrent to the House expressing its views honestly"".MPs will now debate whether this change should be made."

2015-04-13,MPs warn on growth of UK jihadists,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32059813,"Not enough is being done to prevent people leaving the UK to join Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, a group of MPs has warned.Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said Britain must win their ""hearts and minds"".The committee's report comes as the BBC launches a database tracking British jihadists in Syria and Iraq. It shows that many people left in clusters from certain UK areas - often due to friendships and peer groups. The MPs' report argued that preventative work with communities, families and international partners was ""vital"" and needs to be a top priority for the Home Office.  ""The number of cases being brought to public attention should ring alarm bells,"" said Labour MP Mr Vaz.  ""This must be a relentless battle for hearts and minds, and without a strong counter-narrative we are in danger of failing to prevent even more departures. We are at the edge of a cliff."" The BBC has been tracking the stories of the men, women, boys and girls who have gone to Syria and Iraq to understand why they go, where they go from and what happens to them. By analysing around 160 profiles, it reveals the way in which people have travelled in clusters - a group of three young friends from Coventry, another group from Portsmouth, drawn out by one person they knew, others in Cardiff linked to people involved in an extremist organisation. Social media might play a part but face-to-face contact appears just as, if not more, important, according to the database.It includes the stories of: The BBC research emphasises the extent to which real-world contacts, rather than just online connections, are often a key driver of radicalisation and intent to travel to Iraq and Syria. Some of the experts who appeared before the Home Affairs Committee also argued the internet was a secondary influence. They said that universities and prisons were among the two most significant places where radicalisation occurred. A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police, which was not aware of the report, said it would have ""welcomed the opportunity"" to have given evidence to the committee and that it planned to look at the report in detail.The disappearance of schoolgirls Shamima Begum, Amira Abase, both 15, and Kadiza Sultana, 16, from east London in February, raised questions as to who could have done more to prevent their departure. After taking evidence from the police and the families of the girls among others, Mr Vaz said their case suffered from a ""lack of immediate action"". He added: ""Schools and the police must inform parents immediately, and work with them even if there is the smallest hint of radicalisation, or a close association with someone who is thought to have been radicalised.""However, the Met Police spokesman defended the speed of the police response to the schoolgirls' disappearance.  He said the committee's criticism was ""misleading"", pointing to the evidence given by both UK and Turkish authorities of ""rapid exchanges"" between the two.The committee's report said there needed to be an advice service which would be a less extreme step than calling the anti-terrorist hotline.The Association of Chief Police Officer's lead officer for the government's anti-terror strategy Prevent, Chief Constable Sir Peter Fahy, agreed that more needed to be done.However, he said the police ""do not have the capacity"" to routinely work with every school in the country.He added: ""The police service will play its part but the prime responsibility for dissuading young people from getting involved in extremist activity has to lie with parents, families and carers.""The committee also pointed to weaknesses in information sharing with airlines and other countries. It said greater care needed to be taken at airport check-in desks when people were travelling to destinations of concern - namely Syria, Somalia, Iraq and Nigeria, as well as neighbouring countries, such as Turkey. The report said police also needed to work faster to alert overseas partners and airlines when there were concerns over individuals.There were signs that some of the girls had followed extremist accounts on social media, the report said.The committee said that social media companies, such as Facebook and Twitter, should be prepared to suspend accounts when there is evidence they are being used to promote violent extremism.  The report also said it was disappointed the Home Office had not implemented a programme for individuals returning to Britain where there is evidence they had fought in Syria.Security officials estimate that some 600 Britons have left the country to join IS - and while around half may have returned, many are still out there - and some have died.  The BBC project includes detailed profiles of individuals which can be searched, based on hometown, age and gender, as well as those who have been convicted in the courts or who are believed to have been killed."

If not, the prince's private letters will either remain confidential, as the sender intended, or they'll be exposed to a large and inquisitive audience.

That will be a clear pledge from us.""He accused Mr Cameron of making an ""out of the blue, panicky"" announcement on VAT that ""no one in Britain will believe"".Labour, which has already announced plans to increase the top rate of income tax and impose a new ""mansion tax"" on high value properties, insists its plans are fully costed and will not require additional tax hikes if it wins May's general election.Mr Miliband began his final head-to-head encounter with Mr Cameron before the election by joking that the PM had ""announced his retirement plans"" - a reference to a BBC interview in which the prime minister said he would not serve a third term if the Tories remained in power.Challenging Mr Cameron to give a ""straight answer to a straight question"", Mr Miliband pressed him on whether he would rule out a rise in VAT after the election, as Labour had done.In response, the prime minister immediately said ""yes"", prompting loud cheers in turn from the Conservative benches. He contrasted what he said was a ""clear promise"" with Labour's unwillingness to rule out a rise in National Insurance.""I answered a very simple question about VAT. I ruled out an increase... straight answer to him, straight question from me. I have ruled out VAT. Will he rule out national insurance contributions. Yes or no?"" Mr Cameron added: ""We all know this is Labour's job tax. This is their tax of choice. This is what they clobber working people, families and enterprises with.""But Mr Miliband responded by saying there was ""only one person who is going to raise taxes on working families and that is him"".He said nobody would believe Mr Cameron on VAT ""because of his extreme spending plans, because his numbers do not add up and because he promised it last time and broke his promise"".Mr Cameron, he added, had broken other promises made before the last election to reduce annual net migration below 100,000 and not to pursue a major structural re-organisation of the NHS, adding that it was ""time for a better plan and time for a Labour government"".But Mr Cameron suggested a future Labour government would result in the ""chaos of economic crisis"", with Ed Miliband being ""held hostage"" by the SNP.The packed session provided a last opportunity for the two men to rally their MPs and set out their arguments before the start of the election campaign next week.Speaking after the exchanges and the other parties' tax pledges, deputy prime minister Nick Clegg said the Lib Dems ""don't need to raise VAT, national insurance or headline rates of income tax or corporation tax either"".""There are other taxes and other tax loopholes that we can increase or close in order to balance the books,"" he said.

2015-04-13,Met police 'had files on MPs in 90s',https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32044580,"A former undercover police officer has told BBC News that Scotland Yard kept intelligence files on MPs during the 1990s. Ex-Special Branch officer Peter Francis says he saw files on 10 Labour MPs which he and others regularly updated. He says he personally gathered information on three MPs as part of his work infiltrating left-wing groups. The MPs named, and Labour, have called for a forthcoming public inquiry into undercover policing to be widened. Mr Francis operated undercover between 1993 and 1997 in the Met's now disbanded Special Demonstration Squad. He was told to embed himself in left-wing groups or causes that were deemed to pose a potential threat to security. He says that during this period he was told to gather intelligence on MPs and their activities if and when they featured in any of his operations. That information, he says, was added to a special pink file that was available for Special Branch officers to read. Between 1990 and 2001, he claims to have personally seen records relating to Diane Abbott, the late Tony Benn, Jeremy Corbyn, the late Bernie Grant, Peter Hain, Harriet Harman, Ken Livingstone, Joan Ruddock, Dennis Skinner and Jack Straw.Four of the group became ministers during Mr Francis's time in Special Branch - including Jack Straw who was home secretary after 1997. ""When I was deployed undercover in the Special Demonstration Squad, any MP that I came across, such as on demonstrations, I would report back on them,"" he said. Mr Francis says that the files not only contained the MPs' publicly-stated political views - but also intelligence on what was going on behind the scenes in the party or their group. He says some of the information would have been things said in private by the MP, depending on how close each undercover officer had been able to get. Mr Francis said that when he first saw the files he understood that each had probably been created before the individual was an MP because of their personal involvement in radical causes or protests.But he added: ""When they became MPs these files carried on. It [was] your duty as an SDS officer to report back any intelligence that you come across. ""I felt that it was OK to report back on MPs,"" he said. ""I used to give myself a pat on the back, thinking 'I have done a good job'. These MPs were spied on and they should know.""""I don't think the police force should be monitoring MPs, full stop. I don't think we have any right to do that at all. It may be justifiable to say that the Security Service should be doing it - but I certainly don't think the police should be doing it.""Scotland Yard has refused to comment on the substance of the claims, but a spokesman said it had not shied away from serious allegations about the SDS. It said that Operation Herne, the internal police investigation into what happened in the unit, remained an ongoing investigation.""Operation Herne maintains that without speaking to Peter Francis it is simply not possible to fully investigate allegations he makes,"" said a spokesman. ""Operation Herne remains very willing to engage with him.""Mr Francis said that he has refused to speak to Operation Herne because he fears being interviewed under caution as a suspect, rather than a whistleblower. Scotland Yard told the BBC that Operation Herne detectives would be prepared to speak to him as a witness. He has, however, spoken to Mark Ellison QC who reviewed allegations about the SDS for the Home Secretary Theresa May - prompting her to launch a statutory inquiry. He says he will appear before those hearings. Peter Hain, who was a leader of the anti-apartheid movement in the late 1960s and 70s and became an MP in 1991, said he now wants full answers from Scotland Yard. ""I was deeply disturbed to find that files were still being kept by the Special Branch while I and others were serving Members of Parliament,"" he said. ""That is constitutionally an outrage. It infringes the sovereignty of Parliament. ""I want to see the home secretary widen the scope of the inquiry into the SDS to look specifically at the surveillance of MPs and the fact that there were active files on us while we were serving Members of Parliament. ""This should never have happened and it should have been reported and properly authorised - and we don't know whether it was.""Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper echoed the call for the inquiry to be widened in light of what she described as ""extremely serious and disturbing allegations"".""While undercover policing remains a crucial tool in combating serious and organised crime it must not be abused,"" she said.""There have now been a series of serious allegations about undercover policing - ranging from the treatment of Stephen Lawrence's family to police having long-term inappropriate relationships. ""We called some time ago for much stronger oversight of undercover policing and it is also vital to get to the truth about what has happened."" Mrs May announced earlier this month that Lord Justice Pitchford would lead the inquiry into the SDS allegations - but the precise shape of that inquiry is not yet clear.A Home Office spokesman said the review by Mark Ellison QC had unearthed ""serious historical failings"". ""That is why the Home Secretary established a public inquiry to thoroughly investigate undercover policing and the operation of the Special Demonstration Squad. ""Lord Justice Pitchford will consult interested parties to the inquiry over the coming months on setting the terms of reference, with a view to publishing these at the end of July.""Undercover policing is an essential tactic in the fight against crime but to improve the public's confidence in undercover work we must ensure there is no repeat of these failings in the future."""
2015-04-13,NHS problems worst 'since 1990s',https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/health-32057948,"Services in the NHS in England are deteriorating in a way not seen since the early 1990s, according to a leading health think tank. The King's Fund review said waiting times for A&E, cancer care and routine operations had all started getting worse, while deficits were growing.It said such drops in performance had not been seen for 20 years.But the think tank acknowledged the NHS had done as well as could be expected, given the financial climate.Professor John Appleby, chief economist at the King's Fund, which specialises in health care policy, said: ""The next government will inherit a health service that has run out of money and is operating at the very edge of its limits. ""There is now a real risk that patient care will deteriorate as service and financial pressures become overwhelming.""He said in terms of how standards were slipping - not how low they had reached - the situation was the worst it had been since the ""early 1990s"".The report noted much of the deterioration has happened in the second-half of the Parliament with many measures of performance being maintained in the first few years.It said the next government had to address the funding situation, adding the extra £8bn a year NHS England says is needed by 2020, was the ""minimum"" that would be required.The report - a review of performance this Parliament - highlights a range of problems as well as achievements. These include:The report is the second part of the King's Fund pre-election review of the NHS this Parliament.Last month it warned the coalition government's reforms of the health service had been ""damaging and distracting"".The King's Fund report should make worrying reading. The reference to the 1990s conjures up images of - for the NHS at least - a bygone era. The think tank's point was not that waiting times had reached the level they were at then, rather that this is the first time in two decades of almost continuous improvement that there has been a sustained drop in performance.In many ways, that had to happen. Services cannot keep getting better for ever. Nonetheless, the findings are crystal clear: the NHS is at a critical juncture. But what is less easy to determine is to what extent the coalition's policies have contributed to the difficulties.The think tank has already provided a critical analysis of the government's reforms - and when pushed, acknowledged the health service may have been ""in better shape"" if they had not happened.But the more significant issue for the health of the health service this Parliament has been the squeeze on finances. Even though the budget has been increased, it has felt more like a cut to many because demands have risen so quickly.On this though, the King's Fund accepted that the government's hands were tied. Given the state of the economy, ministers did as much as they could have.Read more from NickRoyal College of Nursing general secretary Peter Carter said politicians needed to take note of the warnings made by the King's Fund.""Morale is low, and more and more staff are being made sick with stress because of the intolerable pressure they are under,"" he added. Katherine Murphy, of the Patients Association, said: ""The findings echo what we are hearing on a daily basis on our helpline. It is clear to the public that the future of the NHS is one of the most important issues facing the nation and it should be a central issue in the election campaign.""Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham said: ""Five years ago David Cameron stood on a promise to protect the NHS. This report provides authoritative proof that he has broken that promise.""But a Department of Health spokesman said: ""As the King's Fund says, the NHS has 'performed well in the face of huge challenges', but if we are to continue to invest in the NHS going forward it needs to be backed by a strong economy.""

2015-04-13,SNP 'could block Tory government',https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32045419,"The SNP would block a minority Conservative government by voting down its Queen's Speech if it holds the post-election balance of power, its former leader Alex Salmond has said.Mr Salmond said the move could bring down the government if Labour joined in, with David Cameron ""locked out"".The Conservatives accused him of ""trying to sabotage the democratic will of the British people"".Labour has called his balance of power prediction ""bluster and bluff"".In recent days Mr Salmond, who is bidding to become a Westminster MP at the 7 May general election, has claimed his party could ""hold the power"" in a hung Parliament and would be able to influence the Budget of a minority Labour government.This was dismissed by Labour leader Ed Miliband, who has ruled out a formal coalition with the Scottish nationalists.The SNP currently has six MPs at Westminster, but recent opinion polls suggest its share could increase dramatically at the general election.James Cook, BBC News Scotland correspondentIf the Conservatives attempt to form a minority government and enough MPs vote against their Queen's Speech the administration would fall at the first hurdle and the leader of the opposition would have a shot at forming a government.That's how parliamentary democracy works in the event of a hung Parliament.And yet the Conservatives are saying that by planning to vote against a government he opposes Alex Salmond has ""confirmed he would sabotage the democratic will of the British people in order to make Ed Miliband prime minister"".It is part of their continuing attempt to portray Mr Miliband as a weak leader whose strings are being pulled by Mr Salmond.This kind of language causes despair among Tories north of the border who fear that the party in London is waltzing into an SNP trap.They know that many voters in Scotland will read the phrase ""democratic will of the British people"" and hear ""democratic will of the English people"".Because, if it is illegitimate for Scottish MPs, from whatever party, to vote against one government and support another in the British parliament, then what, voters may ask, is the point of the union?Who is dancing to Mr Salmond's tune now?Mr Salmond, the former Scottish first minister, told the New Statesman that in the event of a hung Parliament, a minority Conservative government would have to ""go straight effectively for a vote of confidence - usually the Queen's Speech, although it could be otherwise, of course - and we'd be voting against.""If David Cameron lost this vote, he said, there would be a two-week period for another government to be formed.BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said Mr Salmond had ""hardened his anti-Conservative rhetoric"" in the interview.A Conservative spokesman said:  ""Alex Salmond has confirmed he would sabotage the democratic will of the British people in order to make Ed Miliband prime minister. ""That would mean chaos for Britain, with weak Ed Miliband dancing to Alex Salmond's tune.""He said the ""only way to keep Britain together"" was to vote Conservative.Mr Salmond's latest comments come after Mr Miliband said the only people writing a future Labour Budget would be himself and shadow chancellor Ed Balls.Speaking in Clydebank on Monday, he added: ""It's not going to be Alex Salmond - not in a million years."""
2015-04-13,MPs criticise 'lack of EU debate',https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32045290,"The government's ""failure"" to let MPs debate EU legislation is ""deplorable"", a Parliamentary committee says.The European Scrutiny Committee said ministers had refused to schedule debates on issues such as free movement and the EU's Budget.It also said BBC coverage of EU matters should be ""improved substantially"".The government said the number of EU debates had doubled since 2009-10, while the BBC said its coverage was ""extensive and impartial"".The cross-party committee's role includes scrutinising EU documents and recommending the most important for debate in the House of Commons.Its report said in the period covering most of the 2014-15 financial year there were three debates on the floor of the House, compared with 12 in 2013-14.It also pointed out that not a single debate had taken place during a nine-month period, between 9 June 2014 and 9 March 2015.""The government's collective failure to schedule so many debates on EU documents over the past year is deplorable, and is a discourtesy to this committee and to all members of the House,"" the MPs said.Prime Minister David Cameron has sought to rally support from other EU leaders for his plans to curb welfare payments to European migrants ahead of a referendum on the UK's membership if he wins the general election.The committee said the government's ""cavalier"" approach was ""at odds with UK ministers' claims in their speeches across the EU about the role of national parliaments"".The Foreign Office said the government was committed to a ""strong EU scrutiny system that enables Parliament to hold it to account for the decisions taken in Brussels"".It added: ""We have made good on our commitment to raise standards by doubling the number of Europe debates on the floor of the House since 2009-10.""This government has also increased by around a fifth since 2010 the number of EU proposals that have been scrutinised and cleared by Parliament before being agreed in Brussels.""The committee has also been examining the BBC's coverage of European issues, taking evidence from director general Lord Hall and head of news James Harding earlier this month.During that appearance, Lord Hall said the desire for balanced output ""ran deep"" within the BBC and he believed that this was being achieved.Mr Harding said if the public was going to trust the BBC to report on politicians impartially it had to be clear that BBC journalists weren't ""asked by politicians to come and account for what they do and in effect do the bidding of those politicians"".But the committee said it was ""concerned about the manner in which the BBC treats EU issues"", calling for coverage to be ""improved substantially"".It suggested coverage did not reflect all sides of the debate on the European Union, and more analysis was needed. Its chairman, Conservative MP Sir William Cash, said the BBC had ""very particular obligations"" to be impartial and to ""educate and inform"".He added:  ""We do not believe this is currently being achieved in the context of the BBC's EU coverage.""A BBC spokesman said the corporation provided extensive and impartial coverage of European and Parliamentary issues, and it would be a breach of the corporation's independence if a committee of MPs instructed the BBC on its coverage."
2015-04-13,Lobbyists must 'conform' with rules,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32047992,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe woman in charge of the government's new register of lobbyists has said she expects the industry to ""conform"" with the statutory system. Speaking ahead of the register's launch, Alison White conceded a lot of lobbyists would not be listed on it.But she said her job was to make sure the rules were implemented and she would do so with ""extreme verve and vigour.""But one critic of the register said it was ""fake"" and full of ""loopholes"".Lobbyists are companies or individuals paid to influence government decisions.The coalition promised to introduce a statutory register of lobbyists when it came to power in 2010, and legislation was passed last year, with ministers saying the move would help clean up politics.However, the new register will only cover consultant lobbyists and will not apply to lobbyists working ""in-house"" for companies or organisations.A person or company will only need to be registered if they are contacting a government minister or permanent secretary in a government department - leading to criticism it will not come close to reflecting the scale or nature of lobbying that goes on across Whitehall.But Ms White, who is independent of the government, said her task was to implement the law as it stood not to question the powers she had been given. ""We are having something that has never been in place before,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""This is a statutory register. The industry tells me it is a professional industry. I expect them to conform with the legislation. It is my job to make sure they do so.""Ms White, who was appointed as the registrar of consultant lobbyists in September, acknowledged the register would not indicate different ""levels of lobbying"".""The legislation was quite narrowly drafted to address a particular issue, which was that it was not always particularly clear, when ministers were being lobbied, who the client of the lobbyist was. That is what the register was set up to do,"" she said.She added: ""This will give anyone who wishes to access the register the opportunity to be able to see who is lobbying and being paid for it and who their clients are. That is the main information the register will contain.""If a lobbyist sets out to influence government policy in some way, they would have to be registered. If they are not registered, then they would not be conforming. They have to go on the register before they lobby.""Ms White said last month that the register would not have any entries on its launch day but she had received more than ""20 expressions of interest"" about joining and companies and individuals might be required to sign up retrospectively.Potential registrants will be able to log on and create an account to file an ""information return"".But Tamasin Cave, from the Alliance for Lobbying Transparency coalition, said ""hardly anyone"" in the industry would be covered by the provisions of the new law. ""You have a huge commercial lobbying industry, and very few of them will have to sign up,"" she told Today.""The second flaw is that it won't show the interaction between lobbyists and government, and that is what a register is for.""It is to show the activity - who is discussing what with whom, but this shows nothing of this interaction. It is a fake register."""
2015-04-13,Car smoking ban MSP welcomes backing,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-south-scotland-32055226,"The Liberal Democrat MSP behind a bill to ban smoking in cars when children are present has welcomed the support of the Scottish government.South of Scotland MSP Jim Hume launched the members' bill in December.The government said it was ""very supportive"" of the principles of the bill, but changes could be needed to make it ""workable"".Motorists could potentially be fined £100 for breaching the rule if it becomes law.Mr Hume lodged draft proposals for a bill last May calling for a ban in Scotland on smoking in private vehicles when children under 18 were present.He said he was ""over the moon"" at the news the Scottish government would endorse the Smoking Prohibition (Children in Motor Vehicles) (Scotland) Bill.He said: ""With cross-party support and the support of many third sector organisations, there is every chance that this could be in place in the next year.""Eighty-four per cent of the 160 responses to my consultation were positive and people from across Scotland have expressed their support for the move.""The bill is about guaranteeing that children in Scotland can have the freedom to go on and lead healthy lives if they choose to.""I look forward to working with MSPs from all parties as the bill progresses.""Public Health Minister Maureen Watt said the Scottish government had considered including the measure in its Public Health Bill, but instead decided to support Mr Hume's proposals.She said: ""As with any bill, as it goes through the scrutiny process, there may be amendments and improvements to strengthen the legislation and ensure it is fit for purpose. ""But we believe that the underpinning principles are strong, and that is why I am pleased to support it.""Scottish Labour and a wide range of health organisations have backed his proposals.But the Scottish Conservatives have reservations about how the bill would work in practice.The party's health spokesman Jackson Carlaw said: ""While Scottish Conservatives support any moves which would protect young people from hazardous second hand smoke we have concerns as to how this would be enforced.""It would be a better use of resources to conduct a public awareness campaign similar to that which is being proposed by the government in Wales.""We will be watching this campaign in order to ascertain what lessons may be learned and what approaches may be adopted in Scotland.""Anti-smoking campaigners welcomed the Scottish government's backing for Mr Hume's bill.ASH Scotland's chief executive Sheila Duffy said: ""It is another public health initiative that can help Scotland move forward with its ambition to achieve a tobacco-free generation in 20 years' time.""It is popular with the public and will bring Scotland into line with upcoming legislation in England and Wales.""We believe it can be effectively enforced and that having the legislation focus on cars with children bypasses concerns over interference in people's private lives.""Jim Hume must be congratulated for taking the initiative on this proposal and for all the hard work he and his team have done to bring this important measure forward.""But Simon Clark, director of the smokers' group Forest, said the bill was ""legislation for legislation's sake"".He said: ""Smoking in cars carrying children is inconsiderate. The overwhelming majority of smokers know that and don't do it.""The very small number that do will carry on regardless because the law will be difficult, if not impossible, to enforce.""Education has to be better than legislation but the government prefers gesture politics and the big stick."""
2015-04-13,Candidate quits over UKIP MEP remark,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32038485,"A UKIP election candidate has quit the party over comments made by the party's only Scottish MEP about a Scottish government minister.Tim Wilson has decided not to stand in South Northamptonshire after David Coburn MEP compared Humza Yousaf to convicted terrorist Abu Hamza.Mr Coburn has apologised for the remarks, saying it was a ""joke"".A spokesman for UKIP said Mr Wilson had failed to emphasise local issues in his general election campaign.UKIP leader Nigel Farage said Mr Coburn's remarks were a ""joke in poor taste"" but he would not be taking any action against him.But Mr Wilson said he was disillusioned with the party over the ""racist jibes"" and has decided to stand down.He told BBC Scotland he was appalled by Mr Coburn's comments about Mr Yousaf and frustrated by the inaction of the party's leadership on the issue.  He said David Coburn had produced ""what I can only describe as an Islamaphobic insult, and that's simply not acceptable"".  Mr Wilson added: ""Of course he went on and apologised.  I think, frankly, that if you are in a position of power you have to be able to control what ideas emerge from your head and how they get to your mouth and, in fact, you shouldn't have those ideas in the first place.  ""But the real issue is that when Mr Farage was asked what he thought about this he dismissed this as a joke.  ""I don't think this is a joke. I think this is something very serious.  It may not be that this man intended to cause offence but we aren't interested in what his intentions are.  We are interested in the effect what he says has on other people and the effect is catastrophic, it's appalling and I've resigned.""In his resignation letter, Mr Wilson said he had been ""systematically gagged by the party whip"" and forbidden to speak about Islam favourably. A spokesman for UKIP said Mr Wilson had failed to put more emphasis on local issues in his campaign.He said: ""Whilst we had initially been optimistic about Tim Wilson's abilities as a candidate, it became obvious in recent weeks that he was out of his depth in representing our party in the way we would expect. ""Mr Wilson had clearly misunderstood the expectations that UKIP place on all of its candidates. Principal amongst those is focusing on issues that are relevant to local voters. UKIP put huge emphasis on local issues and Mr Wilson was unwilling to follow UKIP guidelines in this respect.""Last week MSPs at the Scottish Parliament unanimously condemned the remarks made by Mr Coburn during a newspaper interview.MSPs were debating a motion celebrating Scotland's diverse communities.The president of the European Parliament, Martin Schulz, condemned the remarks, saying they were ""not worthy of any elected member"". But a spokesman for the president said he could not act on remarks made outside parliament.The move comes just days after another candidate, Jonathan Stanley, quit in protest at the ""racist filth"" in UKIP. Mr Stanley, who was due to stand in the Cumbrian seat of Westmorland and Lonsdale, was the party's former head of policy in Scotland."

2015-04-13,Manifesto watch,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-29642613,"Political parties are putting together their manifestos for May's general election. Here's a guide to where they currently stand on the issues voters say they care about most (according to pollsters IPSOS Mori).ImmigrationConservatives:  David Cameron wants to make migrants wait four years before they can claim certain benefits, such as tax credits, Universal Credit, or get access to social housing. He wants to stop migrants from claiming child benefit for dependents living outside the UK, and remove those that have failed to find work after six months. Mr Cameron has promised to put reform of EU free movement rules at the heart of his renegotiation of Britain's relationship with the EU. He has ruled out a temporary cap on migrant numbers or an ""emergency brake"" on EU freedom of movement rules - ideas both mooted in recent months, saying this would be less ""effective"" than reducing the incentives for people to come to the UK. The party has a continuing goal to bring net immigration down to below 100,000 people a year (it currently stands at 243,000).Labour: ""Stronger"" border controls to tackle illegal immigration with ""proper"" entry and exit checks. ""Smarter"" targets to reduce low-skilled migration but ensure university students and high-skilled workers are not deterred. Employment agencies who only recruit abroad will be outlawed while the fines for employing illegal immigrants will be increased.Lib Dems: Reintroduce exit checks at borders, so the government can identify people who are overstaying their visa. Will require all new claimants for Jobseekers Allowance to have their English language skills assessed, with JSA then being conditional on attending language courses for those whose English is poor. Ensure that EU migrants have to ""earn"" their entitlement to benefits.SNP: Allow the devolved government to have control over immigration to Scotland, and introduce a Canadian-style earned citizenship system to attract highly-skilled immigrants.Plaid Cymru: Oppose a points-based system. Support the right of asylum seekers to work in Wales while they wait for status decisions to be made. Lobby the Westminster government to ensure that they shut ""detention"" centres.UKIP: Introduce an Australian-style points policy, used to select migrants with the skills and attributes needed to work in the country - covering people from inside and outside the EU. Bring net immigration down to 50,000 people a year. Priority lanes for UK passport holders. Increase UK border staff by 2,500. Tougher English language tests for migrants seeking permanent residence. Opt out of the Dublin treaty to allow the UK to return asylum seekers to other EU countries without considering their claim. Anyone who currently has the legal right to live, work, or study in the UK would not face deportation in the event of the country's withdrawal from the EU.Greens:  Progressively reduce UK immigration controls. Migrants illegally in the UK for over five years will be allowed to remain unless they pose a serious danger to public safety. More legal rights for asylum seekers.Taxes and the economyConservatives: Eradicate the deficit by 2018 and secure an overall budget surplus by 2019-20. Achieve this by spending cuts, not tax rises, while raising NHS spending. An income tax cut for 30 million people by 2020. Tax would start to kick in at £12,500 a year, instead of £10,500. This will cost £5.6bn. The higher tax rate, 40%, would start at £50,000 instead of £41,900, again by 2020, at a cost of £1.6bn. This will be paid for through £25bn in additional spending cuts and economic growth. No increases in VAT.Labour: Get the current budget into surplus and the national debt falling ""as soon as possible in the next parliament"". No additional borrowing for new spending. Reintroduce the 50p top rate of income tax for earnings over £150,000.  Cut income tax for 24 million people by bringing back the 10p rate, paid for by scrapping the Married Couples' Tax Allowance. Bring in a ""mansion tax"" on properties worth over £2m, to raise £1.2bn. A tax on bankers' bonuses. A 5% pay cut for every government minister. Push for UK overseas territories to be put on an international blacklist if they refuse to co-operate with a drive against tax avoidance. No increases in VAT or National Insurance contributions.Lib Dems: Raise the personal allowance - the point at which you start paying income tax - to £11,000 in April 2016 and then to £12,500 by 2020. ""Strict new fiscal rules"" to ensure the deficit has gone by April 2018, with the wealthy contributing the most. The Lib Dems invented the ""mansion tax"" but in contrast to Labour have set out how it would operate - along similar lines to council tax bands. There are also Lib Dem plans to increase capital gains tax - paid on profits from second homes or shares - from 28% to 35%. Impose an additional 8% rate of corporation tax on UK banks to raise an extra £1bn a year to help pay off the deficit.SNP: Oppose UK plans in the Infrastructure Bill which will allow oil and gas drilling and hydraulic fracturing beneath people's homes without consent. Invest in offshore wind farming. Support an international bank tax and limits to industry bonuses.Plaid Cymru: Build a Green Skills Construction College, specialising in green energy. Establish a publicly-owned energy company. Establish a publicly-owned Bank of Wales business investment bank. Enforce a living wage. Give devolved nations an equal say in institutions that affect everyone's lives, such as the Bank of England.UKIP: Increase the personal allowance to the level of full-time minimum wage earnings, about £13,500, by 2020. Abolish inheritance tax. Introduce a 35% income tax rate between £42,285 and £55,000, at which point the 40% rate becomes payable. Set up a Treasury Commission to design a turnover tax on large businesses. Cut foreign aid budget by £9bn a year. Scrap HS2. Save £8bn a year in membership fees by leaving the EU.  Lower the VAT rate charged on restorations to listed buildings.Greens: People earning more than £100,000 a year would pay 50% income tax. Wealth tax of 1% to 2% on people worth £3m or more. Renationalise the railways and energy companies. Scrap HS2. Allow councils to impose extra business rates on out-of-town supermarkets to fund small local businesses. Crackdown on tax avoidance by multinationals. Allow ""the current dependence on economic growth to cease, and allow zero or negative growth to be feasible without individual hardship"". Commit Britain to a ""zero carbon"" future. Cut rail and bus fares by an average of 10%. Enforce a cap on bankers' bonuses.The NHSConservatives:  Chancellor George Osborne says he will put an extra £2bn into frontline health services across the UK, which he described as a ""down payment"" on a plan drawn up by NHS bosses calling for an extra £8bn a year above inflation by 2020. In England, everyone would be able to see a GP seven days a week by 2020. Recruit 5,000 more doctors.Labour:  Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said Labour would commit an extra £2.5bn a year above Mr Osborne's plan. The money will come from three sources - a new ""mansion"" tax, clamping down on tax avoidance by big corporations and a new tax on tobacco companies. Patients in England would get a GP appointment within 48 hours and would not have to wait longer than a week for cancer tests and results. Scrap the Health and Social Care Act and end ""creeping privatisation"" of the NHS.  Integrate health and social care services into a system of ""whole-person care"". Give greater priority to mental health services. Replace the Cancer Drugs Fund in England when it runs out in 2016 with a £330m fund to improve access to innovative cancer drugs, surgery and radiotherapy. Recruit 5,000 more healthcare workers to help patients stay in their homes and introduce new safety checks to identify people at risk of hospitalisation. Prioritise child mental health by increasing the proportion of the mental health budget spent on children.Lib Dems: An extra £1bn for the NHS every year, to be funded by - amongst other things - making higher earners pay more tax on their shares. Half of this will go towards mental health. Ensure that spending on the NHS rises in line with growth in the economy. People who need therapy for conditions such as depression will be guaranteed treatment within 18 weeks. For young patients experiencing psychosis for the first time treatment will be provided within two weeks of being referred by a GP. This is all going to happen from April, with more mental health targets to follow if the Lib Dems return to government. Wants a cross-party review of the future of NHS funding.SNP: Reduce the number of senior managers in the NHS by 25% over the next parliament. Streamline the work of health boards. Real terms increases in year-on-year NHS spending.Plaid Cymru: Recruit 1,000 extra doctors to the Welsh NHS over two terms of a Plaid government. Offer financial incentives for recruiting doctors to areas and specialisms where there are, or are predicted to be, shortages. Encourage innovation and attract more research funding, in part by increasing research and development funding as government finance allows. Improve training for postgraduate doctors and stop them being used to ""plug gaps"" in staff rotas. More recruitment from within the EU to fill vacancies and using international doctors to staff the NHS while a new generation of Welsh doctors are trained.UKIP: An extra £3bn per year in NHS funding paid for by quitting the EU and through ""middle management"" cuts. Keep NHS free at the point of delivery. Stop any further use of PFI, and encourage local authorities to buy out their PFI contracts early where it is affordable to do so. Ensure all visitors and migrants who have been here for fewer than five years have NHS-approved medical insurance as a condition of entry to UK, with £200m of the £2bn saved to be spent on ending hospital parking charges in England. Bring back state-enrolled nurses and return powers to matrons. Monitor and Care Quality Commission to be replaced with elected county health boards. Stop spending £90m a year on gastric band and breast enhancement operations.Greens: Funding to be diverted away from centralised facilities towards community healthcare, illness prevention and health promotion.  Stop privatisation. Abolish prescription charges. Dedicated NHS Tax to go direct to the health service. Ban proactive recruitment of non-British NHS staff from overseas. A complete ban on the promotion of tobacco and alcohol products, including sponsorship.Security, defence and foreign affairsConservatives: Hold a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU by 2017, after negotiating the return of some powers from Brussels. Protect foreign aid budget. Replace Trident.Labour:  Push for reform of European Union and prevent Britain from ""sleepwalking"" towards exit. Commit in law to holding a Strategic Defence and Security Review every 5 years. Outlaw discrimination and abuse of Armed Forces personnel.Lib Dems: Campaign to reduce the number of Trident nuclear submarines. Push for greater European Union efficiency. SNP: Oppose nuclear weapons and push for removal of Trident submarines from Scotland. In 2010, proposed a Scottish Centre for Reconciliation and Conflict Resolution, to promote peaceful alternatives to armed conflict. Maintain 0.7% commitment to foreign aid. Enhanced role for Scotland within the UK in Europe, particularly in fisheries policy.Plaid Cymru: Honour commitment of 0.7% of budget used for foreign aid. Campaign for cancellation of developing countries' debts. Support the Fair Trade movement. Support the 'Tobin' or 'Robin hood' tax as a means of encouraging more responsibility and stability in the global markets. Reform the IMF and World Bank in order to improve regulation and accountability. Continue membership of the EU, but campaign for democratic reform. Support minority nations and minority language speakers around the world. Pass a Military Wellbeing Act to promote and safeguard the physical and mental health and wellbeing of military personnel.UKIP:  Leave the European Union. Remove the passports of any person who has gone to fight for a terrorist organisation and deport anyone who has committed a terrorist act. Cut foreign aid budget by £9bn. Create a Veterans Department to look after the interests of ex-service men and women.Greens: Referendum on Britain's EU membership. Want reform of EU to hand powers back to local communities. Boost overseas aid to 1% of GDP within 10 years. Scrap Britain's nuclear weapons. Take the UK out of NATO unilaterally. End the so-called ""special relationship"" between the UK and the US.  Stop EU-US free trade deal TTIP. JobsConservatives: Create three million apprenticeships to be paid for by benefit cuts.Labour: Guarantee a job for under 25s unemployed for over a year and adults unemployed for more than two years. As many young people to go on an apprenticeship as currently go to university by 2025. Create a million new high technology, green jobs by 2025. Ban ""exploitative"" zero hour contracts.Lib Dems: An extra £1 an hour for the lowest paid apprentices. Campaign to create a million more jobs.SNP: Introduce gender quotas on public boards. Living wage ""a central priority"" in all Scottish government contracts. Continue the 'small business bonus'.Plaid Cymru: Provide rates relief for small businesses. Increase the number and value of contracts from Welsh public bodies that go to firms within Wales.UKIP: Allow firms to offer jobs to British workers first ""without the fear of being sued for discrimination"".Greens: A national energy conservation scheme to create thousands of new jobs. The party wants to create ""sustainable jobs"" and promotes more local production of food and goods.Education Conservatives: Protect England's schools budget - from reception entry at age four or five to the end of GCSEs at 16 - in cash terms although funding per pupil will not keep pace with inflation. Pre-school and post 16 education not ring fenced. Convert up to 3,500 more schools judged by Ofsted to ""require improvement"" into academies. ""War on illiteracy and innumeracy"". State primary schools in England that repeatedly failed to have a proportion of year-six pupil pass times tables and writing tests be forced to become academies, or have sponsorship replaced if already an academy. Opposed to giving votes to 16 and 17-year-olds for UK-wide general elections and local elections in England.Labour:  Increase the overall education budget in England, including schools, nurseries, Sure Start and provision for 16-to 18-year-olds, by at least the rate of inflation, although per-pupil funding is not specifically protected, meaning some of the increase will be eaten up by rising pupil numbers. Parents of primary school children would be guaranteed childcare from 8am to 6pm. The amount of free childcare for three and four year olds would be increased from 15 to 25 hours a week. Compulsory sex and relationship education in all schools. Refuse to grant business rate relief to independent schools unless they can show a ""meaningful impact"" on state schools through a new School Partnership Standard, for example by lending teaching staff or assisting in university admissions procedures. Committed to extending the franchise to 16 and 17-year-olds in elections across the UK. Double the number of Sure Start childcare places to more than 118,000. Tighten up the rules on primary school class sizes to ensure they do not have more than 30 pupils.Lib Dems: Protect the education budget from cuts. Guarantee qualified teachers and a core curriculum set by independent experts, as well as compulsory sex education, in all state schools including academies and free schools. More money for disadvantaged school children and free childcare for all two year olds. A two-thirds discount on all local bus fares for young people aged 16-21. Supports lowering the voting age to 16 in all UK elections.SNP: Guaranteed free 30 hours of childcare a week for three and four-year-olds in Scotland, up from 16 hours. Maintain lack of tuition fees at Scottish universities, and offer financial support in grants and loans to students. Continue to build and refurbish schools. Lower voting age to 16 in all UK elections.Plaid Cymru: Introduce a compulsory modern foreign language GCSE in secondary schools and the teaching of modern foreign languages in primary schools. Look at ways to strengthen the teaching of Welsh history and culture. Oppose foundation schools, academies and free schools. Look at moving from a per-pupil funding mechanism to a funding model based on the catchment area. Will not support any further increases in tuition fees for higher education students, and will seek the abolition of tuition fees as and when public finances allow. Supports lowering the voting age to 16 for elections to the Welsh Assembly and the UK Parliament.UKIP: More grammar schools. Scrap sex education for children aged under seven. Scrap tuition fees for students from poorer backgrounds who take degree courses in the sciences, technology, maths or engineering. Greater emphasis on vocational education with new Apprenticeship Qualification Option. School governing boards must be made up of at least 30% parents of children at the school. Allow universities to charge same amount for EU students as non-EU students.Greens: End performance related pay for teachers. Replace Ofsted with an independent National Council for Educational Excellence. Bring Free Schools and Academies into local authority control.

Withdraw Jobseeker's Allowance from young people after six months unless they take part in ""community projects"". And 18 to 21-year-olds wouldn't be entitled to housing benefit. Ban on zero-hours contracts which stop people getting work elsewhere. Raise the personal allowance - the point at which you start paying income tax - to £11,000 in April 2016 and then to £12,500 by 2020, which means that if you work on minimum wage for 30 hours you will pay no income tax. Young people out of work, education or training for six months will have to do unpaid community work to get benefits. This will apply to about 50,000 18 to 21-year-olds. Universal benefits for pensioners, such as free bus passes, TV licences for the over 75s and the winter fuel allowance. will once again be protected. Labour: Freeze energy prices until 2017. Increase in the minimum wage from £6.50-an-hour to £8-an-hour by 2020. Rises in child benefit capped at 1% for the first two years of the next parliament. Winter fuel allowance would be withdrawn from the wealthiest pensioners. Repeal what the government calls the spare room subsidy, dubbed the ""bedroom tax"" by Labour.  A million interest-free loans to help people insulate their homes. Rail fares would be capped. Double the amount of paid paternity leave available to new fathers from two to four weeks, and increase statutory paternity pay to £260 a week.Lib Dems: Raise the personal allowance - the point at which you start paying income tax - to £11,000 in April 2016 and then to £12,500 by 2020 (the Conservatives are promising the same thing). Nick Clegg has said he would not accept Conservative plans to freeze working-age benefits without taxing the rich too. He hasn't said he would block welfare cuts altogether. Withdraw eligibility for the Winter Fuel Payment and free TV Licence from pensioners on the 40% rate of income tax. A ""yellow card"" system to deal with benefit claimants breaking the rules, rather than imposing sanctions without warning.SNP: Oppose cuts to in-work benefits. Support moves to extend paternity leave. Introduce a maximum combined withdrawal rate for benefits and reforms to employment support allowance and cold weather payments. Protect policies such as concessionary travel for older Scots.Plaid Cymru: Move away from complex and expensive means testing for child-related benefits. Continue to campaign for the introduction of a living pension during the period of the next parliament for those aged 80 and over. UKIP: Only pay child benefit for the first two children for new claimants. Increase the Carers' Allowance to the same level as Jobseekers' Allowance (JSA) and pay a higher rate of JSA if you've been in work and already made tax and National Insurance contributions. Prevent anyone taking up permanent residence in Britain unless they're able to support themselves and any dependents they bring with them for at least five years and stop them receiving benefits. Stop paying child benefit for children who don't live in Britain. Scrap what UKIP calls the ""detested bedroom tax"". Boost ""credit unions"".Greens: The party backs a Citizen's Income, a fixed amount of £72 income a week to be paid to every individual, whether they are in work or not, to be funded by higher taxes on the better off and green levies.  But in the short-term it would increase the minimum wage to £10 by 2020. Ban zero hours contracts. Axe the ""bedroom tax"". Abolish the work capability assessment and restore the level of the former disability living allowance. Scrap the government's welfare cap, which limits the maximum amount a household can claim annually to £26,000 a year."

2015-04-13,Elephant trap?,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32047998,"The campaign has not even got under way, yet in the space of a couple of hours we have now been treated to not only one election pledge, but to two. The prime minister ruled out raising VAT if re-elected - while Labour said National Insurance contributions wouldn't go up.Usually politicians fudge the question of tax rises.  When he was leader of the opposition David Cameron himself said ""we have no need to raise taxes"" - before hiking up VAT after polling day.Famously, John Major said he had ""no plans"" to put up the sales tax -  before his chancellor did just that.And when he appeared in front of the cross-party Treasury committee of MPs on Tuesday, the current chancellor seemed to be continuing that tradition.  Under repeated questioning, George Osborne said: ""The policies we have do not involve a VAT rise.""That formulation appeared to give him not so much wriggle room, but an entire wriggle mansion.Labour assumed their campaign warning of further VAT rises to come under the Tories was very much on the money.But George Osborne's allies are suggesting privately that he had, in fact, been walking Ed Miliband to the edge of an elephant trap, then beckoning the prime minister to push the opposition leader in.Ed Miliband's strategists fully expected Mr Cameron to repeat the chancellor's obfuscation on tax at the final Prime Minister's Questions of this Parliament. They would then have expanded on the theme, inviting the prime minister to answer other difficult questions - then say he wasn't being straight with the British people for avoiding them.But the Labour leader was completely wrong-footed when first the prime minister said he would rule out a VAT rise and then counter-punched, inquiring if Labour would now rule out an increase in National Insurance contributions.Ed Miliband dodged the question and what could have been downbeat Conservative benches, uneasy over the prime minister's announcement this week of his retirement plans, were given something to cheer.The reason Ed Miliband didn't respond is because he was holding the National Insurance pledge back for Labour's manifesto.But that soon became unsustainable - so the other Ed, the shadow chancellor Ed Balls, had to undertake a hasty round of the TV studios to do just that.When I spoke to him mid-tour, he put on a brave face. His view was that George Osborne, having raised VAT from 17.5% to 20%, wanted to give the issue a low profile - whereas the prime minister had now made the mistake of putting it centre stage. And he believed David Cameron's promise would be judged against his past VAT-raising performance.He defended Ed Miliband's reluctance to talk about National Insurance as he felt it would have been ""inappropriate"" to announce Labour tax policy at PMQs.So the prime minister - always a better tactician than strategist - can at least satisfy himself that he smoked Labour out on NI and disrupted at least one entry in their election campaign grid.But the exchange actually raised more questions than it answered.If the main parties are ruling out further potential sources of revenue, but still committing themselves to eradicating a £90bn black hole in the public finances, will they now be under more pressure during the election campaign to spell out in much greater detail exactly what they intend to cut?"
2015-04-13,Who's next?,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32031343,"David Cameron's declaration that he will not seek a third term in office if he retains power in May has immediately stoked interest in who might fill his shoes when he's gone. Here are the likely - and perhaps less obvious - possibilities.Claim? As chancellor of the exchequer he's the man in charge of the purse strings and master strategist - and reportedly the PM's favourite to succeed him, although he hasn't said as much. Mr Cameron's right-hand man has had an image makeover of late, with a new haircut and a diet to shed some pounds. And he has seemingly recovered from his ""omnishambles"" Budget in 2012, with his latest - and last Budget - of the parliament giving the Tories a lead in some polls. He's said to be well liked among Conservative cabinet ministers and backbench MPs, whose support is vital for any candidate wanting to take on the party leadership. He shas some work to do among grassroots Tory members, however, coming fifth in ConservativeHome's latest online poll of party members on future leaders.Latest odds: 10/1 (according to William Hill)What's he said? ""The prime minister leads a strong team but what you see from him is answering a direct question with a direct answer. I think that's really refreshing. He says he's going to serve that full five years so the real question facing the country now is do you want the strong leadership of David Cameron that's delivering zero inflation and record jobs or do you want the chaos and incompetence of Ed Miliband.""Claim? The longest-serving home secretary in 50 years, she is only the second Conservative woman to secure one of the top four jobs in government. In her role, she has talked tough on immigration and crime and taken on the Police Federation. And she is popular with Tory activists, consistently occupying either first or second place in ConservativeHome's online polls on future party leaders. There have long been claims of Mrs May positioning herself for the top job, with reported tensions between her and the prime minister. Critics say she lacks charisma and micro-manages - while some cannot forget her coining the now infamous ""nasty party"" phrase at a Tory conference in 2002, but supporters say she is a formidable operator, and have dubbed her Britain's Angela Merkel. Latest odds: 9/2What's she said? ""My view is very simple, David Cameron is a first class leader of the party and a first class prime minister and I hope he is going to be doing that for a very long time."" (Desert Island discs, 23 November 2014)Claim? The blonde bombshell and mayor of London who can seemingly reach voters that others in the party cannot. Casting aside a rather chequered past he steered the capital through the 2012 Olympics, launched the successful and popular ""Boris bikes"" and got rid of London's ""bendy buses"" in favour of the new Routemaster double deckers. Mr Johnson hopes to revive his Westminster parliamentary career at the general election. He has been tipped by many to take the helm of the Conservative Party, and has not discouraged the idea. Like Theresa May, he is also a favourite among the grassroots of the party, pipping her to the top spot in ConservativeHome's latest poll of party members on future leaders. (he's ahead by 2 points). Critics say the gaffe-prone politician is not the right man for the job, but his supporters point to his wide-spread appeal.Latest odds: 9/4What's he said? ""I think what David Cameron is saying is banal and obvious. There has already been a leader of the Conservative Party for ten years and he's done an outstanding job. What he's saying now is that he wants to serve through to 2020 and that is frankly what we need him to do... five more years is what this country needs. I'm not entirely certain I see what the story is. He was asked a straight question, are you going to serve a third term like Mrs Thatcher or Tony Blair and he said no, because he thinks that ten years on top of British politics is an incredibly long time.""Claim? A self-made millionaire and devotee of Margaret Thatcher, he is regarded as one of the Conservatives' fastest-rising stars. The Treasury minister-turned-culture secretary became the first of the 2010 intake of MPs to reach cabinet level, and the first Asian male Conservative cabinet minister. He's currently polling well among the Conservative grassroots, who voted him third most preferable leader in ConservativeHome's latest online future leader poll. David Cameron recently said he wants to see a British Asian prime minister in his lifetime.Latest odds: 12/1Claim? Currently holding one of the four great offices of state - foreign secretary - Mr Hammond's name has often cropped up whenever talk of leadership contenders has emerged. He has built up an impressive CV in government since the Conservatives came to power in 2010, being first awarded the job of transport secretary before his promotion to defence secretary where he stayed for three years. He's regarded by many commentators as being a potential candidate for the Tory right. He seems to have work to do among party activists, scoring only 4% in ConservativeHome's future leader poll.Latest odds: 12/1"
2015-04-13,Cereal number,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-magazine-monitor-31962592,"David Cameron has declared he won't seek a third term as prime minister, citing an advertising slogan for Shredded Wheat used in the UK more than 30 years ago. What's its enduring power, asks Justin Parkinson.The hotel kitchen staff are in disbelief. Someone in room 147 has ordered three Shredded Wheat. The maid transports them upstairs to find England cricketer Ian Botham waiting at a table, dressed in full whites.The maid leaves. Botham hides one of the Shredded Wheat under a napkin and winks to camera. Cue music, as the slogan ""Shredded Wheat. Bet you can't eat three"" appears.This advert and others featuring football manager Brian Clough and the actor Richard Kiel, who played Jaws in James Bond films, have not run for some time. Nestle, which owns the brand, says the last probably aired in 1984.But their message seems to have waned little. Telling the BBC he would only serve a limited time in Downing Street, David Cameron said: ""Terms are like Shredded Wheat - two are wonderful but three might just be too many.""The prime minister's reprise was unlikely to be accidental, says Thayne Forbes, joint managing director of the brand-valuation company Intangible Business. ""Everybody would empathise with the view that three Shredded Wheat would probably be too much,"" he says. ""The slogan suggests people shouldn't overdo it. It sounds modest and reasoned.""As marketing goes, it might seem counter-intuitive, as it discourages excessive consumption. But it also sounds honest and unexploitative.Other advertising slogans and themes are in wide use in public and political discourse. Examples include Marmite being a by-word for divisiveness - a ""Marmite person"" is either loved or hated. Cameron has twice referred to Ronseal - the woodcare product that does ""exactly what it says on the tin"". But Shredded Wheat, its best-known slogan having lain dormant for so long, appears to be used less often. The cereal, created in the US in the 1890s, has long been sold as good for the evolving British lifestyle. A newspaper advert in 1902 described it as ""a relief from the monotony of everlasting porridge"", while, by 1943, it was ""an ideal food for all war workers"". The 1980s saw an emphasis on ""simple, honest goodness"", while, in the 2000s, its long heritage and reliability was promoted.""It's a good association for Cameron,"" says Forbes. ""He must have been brought up on it, like lots of other people. It will be great marketing for Shredded Wheat to have the slogan used after so many years, too.""Subscribe to the BBC News Magazine's email newsletter to get articles sent to your inbox"
2015-04-13,Are you 'cosmopolitan'?,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32021853,"The rise of UKIP heralds the emergence of a new divide in British politics, with cosmopolitan voters on one side and non-cosmopolitan ones on the other, argues Jeremy Cliffe.We hear a lot about UKIP these days. The party stole the show at the local and European elections last year, then again in the autumn when it lured two Conservative MPs to defect.  In the past weeks alone there have been three much-discussed television programmes about the party: ""Meet the Ukippers"", ""Farage Fans and UKIP Lovers"" and ""100 Days of UKIP"". At the upcoming general election the party will probably increase its share of seats in Westminster - and will certainly affect the results in dozens of other constituencies by taking votes from the other parties. But ask some of those academics who have been watching UKIP's rise, and they will tell you that it is just one part of a bigger story. We are all used to the left-right divide in politics: a spectrum of different views on how much the government should tax, spend, regulate and otherwise intervene in the economy. But according to Dr Rob Ford of Manchester University, UKIP exists on a different axis, one to do with cultural rather than economic matters. This new political scale is ever more prominent in British political life.Radio 4's Analysis programmeOn the one end of it is what you might call a ""cosmopolitan"" philosophy: a relaxed, liberal attitude to issues concerning national identity (like immigration) and to questions of morality and lifestyle (like gay marriage). On the other end is a ""non-cosmopolitan"" outlook: more nationalist, socially conservative and less comfortable with social change, or in other words the ideological stance often associated with typical UKIP voters. This divide cuts across the left-right scale: there are cosmopolitan and non-cosmopolitan voters in both the Conservative and the Labour camps, which is why UKIP takes support from both.Lots of things are making this cosmopolitanism divide more important. One is that the old class-based, ideological conflict between left and right has declined. Dr James Tilley of Oxford University argues that politicians are partly to blame. The economic philosophies of the Conservative and Labour parties are so similar, he argues, that other, cultural issues are becoming more important. Another factor is the growing gap between the generations: the difference in outlook between the cosmopolitan young and less cosmopolitan, older voters is greater than it was in the past (partly due to the recent rise in levels of university education, which tend to correlate with liberal views). This trend presents the established parties with some difficult questions. As Dr Ford puts it, they ""have to try and deal with this rising value divide, particularly now that UKIP has mobilised it into the political debate."" ""They have to make a move,"" he adds, ""but any move that they make risks making their position worse with one or the other of these groups of voters."" Sound too cosmopolitan, and the parties risk losing supporters to UKIP. Try to ""out-UKIP UKIP"", and they could alienate their younger, more socially liberal supporters. So both are doing the political splits, trying to reconcile the cosmopolitans within their ranks with the non-cosmopolitans. Witness the tortuous attempts by Ed Miliband to sound tough on immigration without sounding too tough. Witness, too, the recent struggles of David Cameron to persuade social conservatives in his party that gay marriage can be an innately conservative institution. In the long-term, this divide will become less problematic. That is because over the years the country will tilt towards the cosmopolitan end of this new spectrum. So says Penny Young of NatCen, the research organisation that conducts the extensive British Social Attitudes survey. Various demographic factors explain this trend. The country as a whole is becoming more accepting of same-sex relationships. Younger voters are more relaxed about things like immigration and national identity than were previous generations when they were young, suggesting that the overall population will tilt in an internationalist direction over time. And ever more parts of the country are acquiring the ethnic and social diversity once confined to the inner cities, a trend that generally makes people more comfortable with immigration. According to Dr Ford the question is therefore: how should the main political parties navigate this period of transition? It would be wrong to simply abandon the swathes of voters at the less cosmopolitan end of the scale; voters who are usually older and more isolated than the average member of the population.Yet the politicians do need to adapt to the changing attitudes of British society and be honest with voters rather than pandering to views that, deep down, they do not share. This quandary may not decide the upcoming general election, but in the established parties savvy strategists with an eye to elections in 2020 and beyond are grappling with it nonetheless. That is a wise move."
2015-04-13,Dudley debate,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32015334,"I met Afzal Amin for the first time on Friday, but I already knew who he was. In Dudley North, the seat he was selected by the Conservatives to fight in the general election, Mr Amin had become hard to avoid. When I first looked at the local newspaper online, the pages were surrounded by ""Amin"" logos in the preferred Tory shade of blue.Not long after we met, he asked me to pose for a photo, snapped by one of his campaign team, and doubtless rapidly tweeted out to followers of the would-be MP.Perhaps no surprise that the man running such a disciplined operation has served in the army and been to Sandhurst. That was very much the message he delivered on Friday, as he addressed school and college pupils at a hustings in Dudley which I'd been invited to chair.There was combative debate, too, not least with his Labour rival, the MP Ian Austin. Both men knew the Dudley contest was critical for their respective parties; Ian Austin held the seat by just over 600 votes in 2010. Just as David Cameron was denied a majority by failing to take seats like this one, so Ed Miliband is unlikely to be in No 10 if Labour loses Dudley North.He was self-confident and fluent. The only obvious mis-step came right at the end, when he interrupted Vicky Duckworth, the Green candidate for the neighbouring seat. She expressed the opinion that politics often seemed to be about men shouting at each other; Mr Amin complained she was engaging in gender bias.A few weeks ago, one Conservative MP who knows him well and respects his talents, said Afzal Amin had warned him of the risks of over-confidence. He thought he risked running before he could walk.Well, he stumbled badly this weekend. Whatever the purpose of his contacts with the English Defence League - and he strongly disputes claims that he wanted them to hold a protest that would then be called off, for which he could then take the credit - the exposure has damaged him and, potentially, the prospects of his party re-taking the seat.In February, the EDL staged a rally against plans for a new mosque in the town. As the Mail on Sunday story makes clear, Afzal Amin pleaded with them beforehand not to hold that demonstration; but it went ahead anyway. It's what happened subsequently which will feature in Tuesday's disciplinary hearing.Over the weekend, I put his defence to a very senior Conservative source - that this was an attempt to broker a compromise in order to bring together a divided community. The arch response: Dudley isn't Kandahar.Nor do I think from my visits to the town, where I'm going to be based for the general election, will people in Dudley appreciate being painted as somewhere riven by racial discord.True, Dudley was the scene of one of England's earliest race riots. But that was in 1962. Although the controversy over replacing the mosque - currently in a converted school and inadequate for the numbers who want to worship there - has been running for a decade, community relations are generally good. Even those who don't want a new mosque didn't want the EDL protestors - nor to be fair the anti-fascist counter-demonstrators who followed them.As for the Conservative Party, the view of the national leadership is that you don't collaborate with the EDL. Not least because the Tories are still struggling to bury some historic baggage in the Black Country: Enoch Powell was an MP in Wolverhampton when he delivered his Rivers of Blood speech about immigration in 1968.Four years before that, there was the notorious election in Smethwick which the Conservatives were accused of winning by wooing white voters with an offensive rhyme suggesting who'd they'd get as a neighbour if they voted Labour. Afzal Amin grew up in Smethwick so he should be aware of that history. He was, until his suspension on Saturday, one of about 17% of Conservative parliamentary candidates who are not white. The party is proud of that, but it's still struggling to translate that into votes.Afzal Amin may believe that he can persuade the party to lift the suspension when he meets party officials on Tuesday. I have my doubts. Even if they accept his defence, will the other parties be so charitable? The allegations would follow him on the campaign trail, and make planned visits by cabinet ministers next to impossible.On Friday, just before the hustings in Dudley began, Afzal Amin gave me his business card. It introduces him as 'prospective member of Parliament Dudley North'. I think I'll keep it; it could yet become a collector's item."

2015-04-14,Bid to change Speaker election rules,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32061097,"A last-minute bid to change the way the Speaker of the House of Commons is elected is to be debated by MPs.Labour criticised the government motion, to be debated on the final day before the dissolution of Parliament, saying the Conservatives were ""trying to play politics with the speakership"".Under the proposals, a secret ballot would decide whether there should be a contested election for the post.MPs currently have to file through the division lobbies to cast their vote.This means it is clear who does or does not back the incumbent as Speaker.Labour's shadow leader of the Commons Angela Eagle raised the party's concerns in the House on Wednesday evening, questioning whether the motion was within parliamentary rules.Current Speaker John Bercow is - technically - one of them, but many Tory MPs have never liked him.They resent his personal style and some believe he is far from impartial in the way he conducts business in the Commons.Attempts by some to force a vote on his resumption as Speaker in 2010 came to nothing. There have been the occasional measured jibes at him from the prime minister. Other Tories reportedly went much further and formed a group whose members had all been reprimanded by him. But the Speaker is a reformer who believes passionately that the people who elect the members, and pay the bills, should come first.The last act of the coalition looks like being an attempt to unseat him. And they are very serious about it.One Tory MP fighting an important marginal seat had been cleared by his party to be away from Parliament but he is now staying for the vote, such is the importance of it.She told Deputy Speaker Lindsay Hoyle: ""It's just come to my attention that the government has tabled a motion for debate on the final day of this Parliament, with no notice whatsoever to myself as shadow leader of the House, proposing changes to the way in which the Speaker of this House is elected.""Procedural matters in this House, with no consultation with the opposition, no consultation with the chair of the committee itself, for debate in only one hour tomorrow.""Mr Hoyle said the motion had been ""rightly or wrongly"" agreed to on Tuesday, saying that ""business of the House is decided by the government, not by the chair.""A spokesman for Commons Leader William Hague said the motion had been tabled as a free hour had opened up in Thursday's business after the House of Lords approved the Modern Slavery Bill.The proposed change would apply when a Speaker wishes to continue in the post after a general election.Under the current rules, if the Speaker's re-appointment is objected to, a division is held, with MPs choosing to back or oppose the Speaker in the division lobbies.The replacement of this method with a secret ballot was suggested in 2010 by a committee of MPs, which said the public method ""can be seen as a deterrent to the House expressing its views honestly"".MPs will now debate whether this change should be made."

2015-04-14,MPs warn on growth of UK jihadists,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32059813,"Not enough is being done to prevent people leaving the UK to join Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, a group of MPs has warned.Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said Britain must win their ""hearts and minds"".The committee's report comes as the BBC launches a database tracking British jihadists in Syria and Iraq. It shows that many people left in clusters from certain UK areas - often due to friendships and peer groups. The MPs' report argued that preventative work with communities, families and international partners was ""vital"" and needs to be a top priority for the Home Office.  ""The number of cases being brought to public attention should ring alarm bells,"" said Labour MP Mr Vaz.  ""This must be a relentless battle for hearts and minds, and without a strong counter-narrative we are in danger of failing to prevent even more departures. We are at the edge of a cliff."" The BBC has been tracking the stories of the men, women, boys and girls who have gone to Syria and Iraq to understand why they go, where they go from and what happens to them. By analysing around 160 profiles, it reveals the way in which people have travelled in clusters - a group of three young friends from Coventry, another group from Portsmouth, drawn out by one person they knew, others in Cardiff linked to people involved in an extremist organisation. Social media might play a part but face-to-face contact appears just as, if not more, important, according to the database.It includes the stories of: The BBC research emphasises the extent to which real-world contacts, rather than just online connections, are often a key driver of radicalisation and intent to travel to Iraq and Syria. Some of the experts who appeared before the Home Affairs Committee also argued the internet was a secondary influence. They said that universities and prisons were among the two most significant places where radicalisation occurred. A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police, which was not aware of the report, said it would have ""welcomed the opportunity"" to have given evidence to the committee and that it planned to look at the report in detail.The disappearance of schoolgirls Shamima Begum, Amira Abase, both 15, and Kadiza Sultana, 16, from east London in February, raised questions as to who could have done more to prevent their departure. After taking evidence from the police and the families of the girls among others, Mr Vaz said their case suffered from a ""lack of immediate action"". He added: ""Schools and the police must inform parents immediately, and work with them even if there is the smallest hint of radicalisation, or a close association with someone who is thought to have been radicalised.""However, the Met Police spokesman defended the speed of the police response to the schoolgirls' disappearance.  He said the committee's criticism was ""misleading"", pointing to the evidence given by both UK and Turkish authorities of ""rapid exchanges"" between the two.The committee's report said there needed to be an advice service which would be a less extreme step than calling the anti-terrorist hotline.The Association of Chief Police Officer's lead officer for the government's anti-terror strategy Prevent, Chief Constable Sir Peter Fahy, agreed that more needed to be done.However, he said the police ""do not have the capacity"" to routinely work with every school in the country.He added: ""The police service will play its part but the prime responsibility for dissuading young people from getting involved in extremist activity has to lie with parents, families and carers.""The committee also pointed to weaknesses in information sharing with airlines and other countries. It said greater care needed to be taken at airport check-in desks when people were travelling to destinations of concern - namely Syria, Somalia, Iraq and Nigeria, as well as neighbouring countries, such as Turkey. The report said police also needed to work faster to alert overseas partners and airlines when there were concerns over individuals.There were signs that some of the girls had followed extremist accounts on social media, the report said.The committee said that social media companies, such as Facebook and Twitter, should be prepared to suspend accounts when there is evidence they are being used to promote violent extremism.  The report also said it was disappointed the Home Office had not implemented a programme for individuals returning to Britain where there is evidence they had fought in Syria.Security officials estimate that some 600 Britons have left the country to join IS - and while around half may have returned, many are still out there - and some have died.  The BBC project includes detailed profiles of individuals which can be searched, based on hometown, age and gender, as well as those who have been convicted in the courts or who are believed to have been killed."

If not, the prince's private letters will either remain confidential, as the sender intended, or they'll be exposed to a large and inquisitive audience.

That will be a clear pledge from us.""He accused Mr Cameron of making an ""out of the blue, panicky"" announcement on VAT that ""no one in Britain will believe"".Labour, which has already announced plans to increase the top rate of income tax and impose a new ""mansion tax"" on high value properties, insists its plans are fully costed and will not require additional tax hikes if it wins May's general election.Mr Miliband began his final head-to-head encounter with Mr Cameron before the election by joking that the PM had ""announced his retirement plans"" - a reference to a BBC interview in which the prime minister said he would not serve a third term if the Tories remained in power.Challenging Mr Cameron to give a ""straight answer to a straight question"", Mr Miliband pressed him on whether he would rule out a rise in VAT after the election, as Labour had done.In response, the prime minister immediately said ""yes"", prompting loud cheers in turn from the Conservative benches. He contrasted what he said was a ""clear promise"" with Labour's unwillingness to rule out a rise in National Insurance.""I answered a very simple question about VAT. I ruled out an increase... straight answer to him, straight question from me. I have ruled out VAT. Will he rule out national insurance contributions. Yes or no?"" Mr Cameron added: ""We all know this is Labour's job tax. This is their tax of choice. This is what they clobber working people, families and enterprises with.""But Mr Miliband responded by saying there was ""only one person who is going to raise taxes on working families and that is him"".He said nobody would believe Mr Cameron on VAT ""because of his extreme spending plans, because his numbers do not add up and because he promised it last time and broke his promise"".Mr Cameron, he added, had broken other promises made before the last election to reduce annual net migration below 100,000 and not to pursue a major structural re-organisation of the NHS, adding that it was ""time for a better plan and time for a Labour government"".But Mr Cameron suggested a future Labour government would result in the ""chaos of economic crisis"", with Ed Miliband being ""held hostage"" by the SNP.The packed session provided a last opportunity for the two men to rally their MPs and set out their arguments before the start of the election campaign next week.Speaking after the exchanges and the other parties' tax pledges, deputy prime minister Nick Clegg said the Lib Dems ""don't need to raise VAT, national insurance or headline rates of income tax or corporation tax either"".""There are other taxes and other tax loopholes that we can increase or close in order to balance the books,"" he said.

2015-04-14,Met police 'had files on MPs in 90s',https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32044580,"A former undercover police officer has told BBC News that Scotland Yard kept intelligence files on MPs during the 1990s. Ex-Special Branch officer Peter Francis says he saw files on 10 Labour MPs which he and others regularly updated. He says he personally gathered information on three MPs as part of his work infiltrating left-wing groups. The MPs named, and Labour, have called for a forthcoming public inquiry into undercover policing to be widened. Mr Francis operated undercover between 1993 and 1997 in the Met's now disbanded Special Demonstration Squad. He was told to embed himself in left-wing groups or causes that were deemed to pose a potential threat to security. He says that during this period he was told to gather intelligence on MPs and their activities if and when they featured in any of his operations. That information, he says, was added to a special pink file that was available for Special Branch officers to read. Between 1990 and 2001, he claims to have personally seen records relating to Diane Abbott, the late Tony Benn, Jeremy Corbyn, the late Bernie Grant, Peter Hain, Harriet Harman, Ken Livingstone, Joan Ruddock, Dennis Skinner and Jack Straw.Four of the group became ministers during Mr Francis's time in Special Branch - including Jack Straw who was home secretary after 1997. ""When I was deployed undercover in the Special Demonstration Squad, any MP that I came across, such as on demonstrations, I would report back on them,"" he said. Mr Francis says that the files not only contained the MPs' publicly-stated political views - but also intelligence on what was going on behind the scenes in the party or their group. He says some of the information would have been things said in private by the MP, depending on how close each undercover officer had been able to get. Mr Francis said that when he first saw the files he understood that each had probably been created before the individual was an MP because of their personal involvement in radical causes or protests.But he added: ""When they became MPs these files carried on. It [was] your duty as an SDS officer to report back any intelligence that you come across. ""I felt that it was OK to report back on MPs,"" he said. ""I used to give myself a pat on the back, thinking 'I have done a good job'. These MPs were spied on and they should know.""""I don't think the police force should be monitoring MPs, full stop. I don't think we have any right to do that at all. It may be justifiable to say that the Security Service should be doing it - but I certainly don't think the police should be doing it.""Scotland Yard has refused to comment on the substance of the claims, but a spokesman said it had not shied away from serious allegations about the SDS. It said that Operation Herne, the internal police investigation into what happened in the unit, remained an ongoing investigation.""Operation Herne maintains that without speaking to Peter Francis it is simply not possible to fully investigate allegations he makes,"" said a spokesman. ""Operation Herne remains very willing to engage with him.""Mr Francis said that he has refused to speak to Operation Herne because he fears being interviewed under caution as a suspect, rather than a whistleblower. Scotland Yard told the BBC that Operation Herne detectives would be prepared to speak to him as a witness. He has, however, spoken to Mark Ellison QC who reviewed allegations about the SDS for the Home Secretary Theresa May - prompting her to launch a statutory inquiry. He says he will appear before those hearings. Peter Hain, who was a leader of the anti-apartheid movement in the late 1960s and 70s and became an MP in 1991, said he now wants full answers from Scotland Yard. ""I was deeply disturbed to find that files were still being kept by the Special Branch while I and others were serving Members of Parliament,"" he said. ""That is constitutionally an outrage. It infringes the sovereignty of Parliament. ""I want to see the home secretary widen the scope of the inquiry into the SDS to look specifically at the surveillance of MPs and the fact that there were active files on us while we were serving Members of Parliament. ""This should never have happened and it should have been reported and properly authorised - and we don't know whether it was.""Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper echoed the call for the inquiry to be widened in light of what she described as ""extremely serious and disturbing allegations"".""While undercover policing remains a crucial tool in combating serious and organised crime it must not be abused,"" she said.""There have now been a series of serious allegations about undercover policing - ranging from the treatment of Stephen Lawrence's family to police having long-term inappropriate relationships. ""We called some time ago for much stronger oversight of undercover policing and it is also vital to get to the truth about what has happened."" Mrs May announced earlier this month that Lord Justice Pitchford would lead the inquiry into the SDS allegations - but the precise shape of that inquiry is not yet clear.A Home Office spokesman said the review by Mark Ellison QC had unearthed ""serious historical failings"". ""That is why the Home Secretary established a public inquiry to thoroughly investigate undercover policing and the operation of the Special Demonstration Squad. ""Lord Justice Pitchford will consult interested parties to the inquiry over the coming months on setting the terms of reference, with a view to publishing these at the end of July.""Undercover policing is an essential tactic in the fight against crime but to improve the public's confidence in undercover work we must ensure there is no repeat of these failings in the future."""
2015-04-14,NHS problems worst 'since 1990s',https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/health-32057948,"Services in the NHS in England are deteriorating in a way not seen since the early 1990s, according to a leading health think tank. The King's Fund review said waiting times for A&E, cancer care and routine operations had all started getting worse, while deficits were growing.It said such drops in performance had not been seen for 20 years.But the think tank acknowledged the NHS had done as well as could be expected, given the financial climate.Professor John Appleby, chief economist at the King's Fund, which specialises in health care policy, said: ""The next government will inherit a health service that has run out of money and is operating at the very edge of its limits. ""There is now a real risk that patient care will deteriorate as service and financial pressures become overwhelming.""He said in terms of how standards were slipping - not how low they had reached - the situation was the worst it had been since the ""early 1990s"".The report noted much of the deterioration has happened in the second-half of the Parliament with many measures of performance being maintained in the first few years.It said the next government had to address the funding situation, adding the extra £8bn a year NHS England says is needed by 2020, was the ""minimum"" that would be required.The report - a review of performance this Parliament - highlights a range of problems as well as achievements. These include:The report is the second part of the King's Fund pre-election review of the NHS this Parliament.Last month it warned the coalition government's reforms of the health service had been ""damaging and distracting"".The King's Fund report should make worrying reading. The reference to the 1990s conjures up images of - for the NHS at least - a bygone era. The think tank's point was not that waiting times had reached the level they were at then, rather that this is the first time in two decades of almost continuous improvement that there has been a sustained drop in performance.In many ways, that had to happen. Services cannot keep getting better for ever. Nonetheless, the findings are crystal clear: the NHS is at a critical juncture. But what is less easy to determine is to what extent the coalition's policies have contributed to the difficulties.The think tank has already provided a critical analysis of the government's reforms - and when pushed, acknowledged the health service may have been ""in better shape"" if they had not happened.But the more significant issue for the health of the health service this Parliament has been the squeeze on finances. Even though the budget has been increased, it has felt more like a cut to many because demands have risen so quickly.On this though, the King's Fund accepted that the government's hands were tied. Given the state of the economy, ministers did as much as they could have.Read more from NickRoyal College of Nursing general secretary Peter Carter said politicians needed to take note of the warnings made by the King's Fund.""Morale is low, and more and more staff are being made sick with stress because of the intolerable pressure they are under,"" he added. Katherine Murphy, of the Patients Association, said: ""The findings echo what we are hearing on a daily basis on our helpline. It is clear to the public that the future of the NHS is one of the most important issues facing the nation and it should be a central issue in the election campaign.""Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham said: ""Five years ago David Cameron stood on a promise to protect the NHS. This report provides authoritative proof that he has broken that promise.""But a Department of Health spokesman said: ""As the King's Fund says, the NHS has 'performed well in the face of huge challenges', but if we are to continue to invest in the NHS going forward it needs to be backed by a strong economy.""

2015-04-14,SNP 'could block Tory government',https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32045419,"The SNP would block a minority Conservative government by voting down its Queen's Speech if it holds the post-election balance of power, its former leader Alex Salmond has said.Mr Salmond said the move could bring down the government if Labour joined in, with David Cameron ""locked out"".The Conservatives accused him of ""trying to sabotage the democratic will of the British people"".Labour has called his balance of power prediction ""bluster and bluff"".In recent days Mr Salmond, who is bidding to become a Westminster MP at the 7 May general election, has claimed his party could ""hold the power"" in a hung Parliament and would be able to influence the Budget of a minority Labour government.This was dismissed by Labour leader Ed Miliband, who has ruled out a formal coalition with the Scottish nationalists.The SNP currently has six MPs at Westminster, but recent opinion polls suggest its share could increase dramatically at the general election.James Cook, BBC News Scotland correspondentIf the Conservatives attempt to form a minority government and enough MPs vote against their Queen's Speech the administration would fall at the first hurdle and the leader of the opposition would have a shot at forming a government.That's how parliamentary democracy works in the event of a hung Parliament.And yet the Conservatives are saying that by planning to vote against a government he opposes Alex Salmond has ""confirmed he would sabotage the democratic will of the British people in order to make Ed Miliband prime minister"".It is part of their continuing attempt to portray Mr Miliband as a weak leader whose strings are being pulled by Mr Salmond.This kind of language causes despair among Tories north of the border who fear that the party in London is waltzing into an SNP trap.They know that many voters in Scotland will read the phrase ""democratic will of the British people"" and hear ""democratic will of the English people"".Because, if it is illegitimate for Scottish MPs, from whatever party, to vote against one government and support another in the British parliament, then what, voters may ask, is the point of the union?Who is dancing to Mr Salmond's tune now?Mr Salmond, the former Scottish first minister, told the New Statesman that in the event of a hung Parliament, a minority Conservative government would have to ""go straight effectively for a vote of confidence - usually the Queen's Speech, although it could be otherwise, of course - and we'd be voting against.""If David Cameron lost this vote, he said, there would be a two-week period for another government to be formed.BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said Mr Salmond had ""hardened his anti-Conservative rhetoric"" in the interview.A Conservative spokesman said:  ""Alex Salmond has confirmed he would sabotage the democratic will of the British people in order to make Ed Miliband prime minister. ""That would mean chaos for Britain, with weak Ed Miliband dancing to Alex Salmond's tune.""He said the ""only way to keep Britain together"" was to vote Conservative.Mr Salmond's latest comments come after Mr Miliband said the only people writing a future Labour Budget would be himself and shadow chancellor Ed Balls.Speaking in Clydebank on Monday, he added: ""It's not going to be Alex Salmond - not in a million years."""
2015-04-14,MPs criticise 'lack of EU debate',https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32045290,"The government's ""failure"" to let MPs debate EU legislation is ""deplorable"", a Parliamentary committee says.The European Scrutiny Committee said ministers had refused to schedule debates on issues such as free movement and the EU's Budget.It also said BBC coverage of EU matters should be ""improved substantially"".The government said the number of EU debates had doubled since 2009-10, while the BBC said its coverage was ""extensive and impartial"".The cross-party committee's role includes scrutinising EU documents and recommending the most important for debate in the House of Commons.Its report said in the period covering most of the 2014-15 financial year there were three debates on the floor of the House, compared with 12 in 2013-14.It also pointed out that not a single debate had taken place during a nine-month period, between 9 June 2014 and 9 March 2015.""The government's collective failure to schedule so many debates on EU documents over the past year is deplorable, and is a discourtesy to this committee and to all members of the House,"" the MPs said.Prime Minister David Cameron has sought to rally support from other EU leaders for his plans to curb welfare payments to European migrants ahead of a referendum on the UK's membership if he wins the general election.The committee said the government's ""cavalier"" approach was ""at odds with UK ministers' claims in their speeches across the EU about the role of national parliaments"".The Foreign Office said the government was committed to a ""strong EU scrutiny system that enables Parliament to hold it to account for the decisions taken in Brussels"".It added: ""We have made good on our commitment to raise standards by doubling the number of Europe debates on the floor of the House since 2009-10.""This government has also increased by around a fifth since 2010 the number of EU proposals that have been scrutinised and cleared by Parliament before being agreed in Brussels.""The committee has also been examining the BBC's coverage of European issues, taking evidence from director general Lord Hall and head of news James Harding earlier this month.During that appearance, Lord Hall said the desire for balanced output ""ran deep"" within the BBC and he believed that this was being achieved.Mr Harding said if the public was going to trust the BBC to report on politicians impartially it had to be clear that BBC journalists weren't ""asked by politicians to come and account for what they do and in effect do the bidding of those politicians"".But the committee said it was ""concerned about the manner in which the BBC treats EU issues"", calling for coverage to be ""improved substantially"".It suggested coverage did not reflect all sides of the debate on the European Union, and more analysis was needed. Its chairman, Conservative MP Sir William Cash, said the BBC had ""very particular obligations"" to be impartial and to ""educate and inform"".He added:  ""We do not believe this is currently being achieved in the context of the BBC's EU coverage.""A BBC spokesman said the corporation provided extensive and impartial coverage of European and Parliamentary issues, and it would be a breach of the corporation's independence if a committee of MPs instructed the BBC on its coverage."
2015-04-14,Lobbyists must 'conform' with rules,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32047992,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe woman in charge of the government's new register of lobbyists has said she expects the industry to ""conform"" with the statutory system. Speaking ahead of the register's launch, Alison White conceded a lot of lobbyists would not be listed on it.But she said her job was to make sure the rules were implemented and she would do so with ""extreme verve and vigour.""But one critic of the register said it was ""fake"" and full of ""loopholes"".Lobbyists are companies or individuals paid to influence government decisions.The coalition promised to introduce a statutory register of lobbyists when it came to power in 2010, and legislation was passed last year, with ministers saying the move would help clean up politics.However, the new register will only cover consultant lobbyists and will not apply to lobbyists working ""in-house"" for companies or organisations.A person or company will only need to be registered if they are contacting a government minister or permanent secretary in a government department - leading to criticism it will not come close to reflecting the scale or nature of lobbying that goes on across Whitehall.But Ms White, who is independent of the government, said her task was to implement the law as it stood not to question the powers she had been given. ""We are having something that has never been in place before,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""This is a statutory register. The industry tells me it is a professional industry. I expect them to conform with the legislation. It is my job to make sure they do so.""Ms White, who was appointed as the registrar of consultant lobbyists in September, acknowledged the register would not indicate different ""levels of lobbying"".""The legislation was quite narrowly drafted to address a particular issue, which was that it was not always particularly clear, when ministers were being lobbied, who the client of the lobbyist was. That is what the register was set up to do,"" she said.She added: ""This will give anyone who wishes to access the register the opportunity to be able to see who is lobbying and being paid for it and who their clients are. That is the main information the register will contain.""If a lobbyist sets out to influence government policy in some way, they would have to be registered. If they are not registered, then they would not be conforming. They have to go on the register before they lobby.""Ms White said last month that the register would not have any entries on its launch day but she had received more than ""20 expressions of interest"" about joining and companies and individuals might be required to sign up retrospectively.Potential registrants will be able to log on and create an account to file an ""information return"".But Tamasin Cave, from the Alliance for Lobbying Transparency coalition, said ""hardly anyone"" in the industry would be covered by the provisions of the new law. ""You have a huge commercial lobbying industry, and very few of them will have to sign up,"" she told Today.""The second flaw is that it won't show the interaction between lobbyists and government, and that is what a register is for.""It is to show the activity - who is discussing what with whom, but this shows nothing of this interaction. It is a fake register."""
2015-04-14,Car smoking ban MSP welcomes backing,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-south-scotland-32055226,"The Liberal Democrat MSP behind a bill to ban smoking in cars when children are present has welcomed the support of the Scottish government.South of Scotland MSP Jim Hume launched the members' bill in December.The government said it was ""very supportive"" of the principles of the bill, but changes could be needed to make it ""workable"".Motorists could potentially be fined £100 for breaching the rule if it becomes law.Mr Hume lodged draft proposals for a bill last May calling for a ban in Scotland on smoking in private vehicles when children under 18 were present.He said he was ""over the moon"" at the news the Scottish government would endorse the Smoking Prohibition (Children in Motor Vehicles) (Scotland) Bill.He said: ""With cross-party support and the support of many third sector organisations, there is every chance that this could be in place in the next year.""Eighty-four per cent of the 160 responses to my consultation were positive and people from across Scotland have expressed their support for the move.""The bill is about guaranteeing that children in Scotland can have the freedom to go on and lead healthy lives if they choose to.""I look forward to working with MSPs from all parties as the bill progresses.""Public Health Minister Maureen Watt said the Scottish government had considered including the measure in its Public Health Bill, but instead decided to support Mr Hume's proposals.She said: ""As with any bill, as it goes through the scrutiny process, there may be amendments and improvements to strengthen the legislation and ensure it is fit for purpose. ""But we believe that the underpinning principles are strong, and that is why I am pleased to support it.""Scottish Labour and a wide range of health organisations have backed his proposals.But the Scottish Conservatives have reservations about how the bill would work in practice.The party's health spokesman Jackson Carlaw said: ""While Scottish Conservatives support any moves which would protect young people from hazardous second hand smoke we have concerns as to how this would be enforced.""It would be a better use of resources to conduct a public awareness campaign similar to that which is being proposed by the government in Wales.""We will be watching this campaign in order to ascertain what lessons may be learned and what approaches may be adopted in Scotland.""Anti-smoking campaigners welcomed the Scottish government's backing for Mr Hume's bill.ASH Scotland's chief executive Sheila Duffy said: ""It is another public health initiative that can help Scotland move forward with its ambition to achieve a tobacco-free generation in 20 years' time.""It is popular with the public and will bring Scotland into line with upcoming legislation in England and Wales.""We believe it can be effectively enforced and that having the legislation focus on cars with children bypasses concerns over interference in people's private lives.""Jim Hume must be congratulated for taking the initiative on this proposal and for all the hard work he and his team have done to bring this important measure forward.""But Simon Clark, director of the smokers' group Forest, said the bill was ""legislation for legislation's sake"".He said: ""Smoking in cars carrying children is inconsiderate. The overwhelming majority of smokers know that and don't do it.""The very small number that do will carry on regardless because the law will be difficult, if not impossible, to enforce.""Education has to be better than legislation but the government prefers gesture politics and the big stick."""
2015-04-14,Candidate quits over UKIP MEP remark,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32038485,"A UKIP election candidate has quit the party over comments made by the party's only Scottish MEP about a Scottish government minister.Tim Wilson has decided not to stand in South Northamptonshire after David Coburn MEP compared Humza Yousaf to convicted terrorist Abu Hamza.Mr Coburn has apologised for the remarks, saying it was a ""joke"".A spokesman for UKIP said Mr Wilson had failed to emphasise local issues in his general election campaign.UKIP leader Nigel Farage said Mr Coburn's remarks were a ""joke in poor taste"" but he would not be taking any action against him.But Mr Wilson said he was disillusioned with the party over the ""racist jibes"" and has decided to stand down.He told BBC Scotland he was appalled by Mr Coburn's comments about Mr Yousaf and frustrated by the inaction of the party's leadership on the issue.  He said David Coburn had produced ""what I can only describe as an Islamaphobic insult, and that's simply not acceptable"".  Mr Wilson added: ""Of course he went on and apologised.  I think, frankly, that if you are in a position of power you have to be able to control what ideas emerge from your head and how they get to your mouth and, in fact, you shouldn't have those ideas in the first place.  ""But the real issue is that when Mr Farage was asked what he thought about this he dismissed this as a joke.  ""I don't think this is a joke. I think this is something very serious.  It may not be that this man intended to cause offence but we aren't interested in what his intentions are.  We are interested in the effect what he says has on other people and the effect is catastrophic, it's appalling and I've resigned.""In his resignation letter, Mr Wilson said he had been ""systematically gagged by the party whip"" and forbidden to speak about Islam favourably. A spokesman for UKIP said Mr Wilson had failed to put more emphasis on local issues in his campaign.He said: ""Whilst we had initially been optimistic about Tim Wilson's abilities as a candidate, it became obvious in recent weeks that he was out of his depth in representing our party in the way we would expect. ""Mr Wilson had clearly misunderstood the expectations that UKIP place on all of its candidates. Principal amongst those is focusing on issues that are relevant to local voters. UKIP put huge emphasis on local issues and Mr Wilson was unwilling to follow UKIP guidelines in this respect.""Last week MSPs at the Scottish Parliament unanimously condemned the remarks made by Mr Coburn during a newspaper interview.MSPs were debating a motion celebrating Scotland's diverse communities.The president of the European Parliament, Martin Schulz, condemned the remarks, saying they were ""not worthy of any elected member"". But a spokesman for the president said he could not act on remarks made outside parliament.The move comes just days after another candidate, Jonathan Stanley, quit in protest at the ""racist filth"" in UKIP. Mr Stanley, who was due to stand in the Cumbrian seat of Westmorland and Lonsdale, was the party's former head of policy in Scotland."

2015-04-14,Manifesto watch,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-29642613,"Political parties are putting together their manifestos for May's general election. Here's a guide to where they currently stand on the issues voters say they care about most (according to pollsters IPSOS Mori).ImmigrationConservatives:  David Cameron wants to make migrants wait four years before they can claim certain benefits, such as tax credits, Universal Credit, or get access to social housing. He wants to stop migrants from claiming child benefit for dependents living outside the UK, and remove those that have failed to find work after six months. Mr Cameron has promised to put reform of EU free movement rules at the heart of his renegotiation of Britain's relationship with the EU. He has ruled out a temporary cap on migrant numbers or an ""emergency brake"" on EU freedom of movement rules - ideas both mooted in recent months, saying this would be less ""effective"" than reducing the incentives for people to come to the UK. The party has a continuing goal to bring net immigration down to below 100,000 people a year (it currently stands at 243,000).Labour: ""Stronger"" border controls to tackle illegal immigration with ""proper"" entry and exit checks. ""Smarter"" targets to reduce low-skilled migration but ensure university students and high-skilled workers are not deterred. Employment agencies who only recruit abroad will be outlawed while the fines for employing illegal immigrants will be increased.Lib Dems: Reintroduce exit checks at borders, so the government can identify people who are overstaying their visa. Will require all new claimants for Jobseekers Allowance to have their English language skills assessed, with JSA then being conditional on attending language courses for those whose English is poor. Ensure that EU migrants have to ""earn"" their entitlement to benefits.SNP: Allow the devolved government to have control over immigration to Scotland, and introduce a Canadian-style earned citizenship system to attract highly-skilled immigrants.Plaid Cymru: Oppose a points-based system. Support the right of asylum seekers to work in Wales while they wait for status decisions to be made. Lobby the Westminster government to ensure that they shut ""detention"" centres.UKIP: Introduce an Australian-style points policy, used to select migrants with the skills and attributes needed to work in the country - covering people from inside and outside the EU. Bring net immigration down to 50,000 people a year. Priority lanes for UK passport holders. Increase UK border staff by 2,500. Tougher English language tests for migrants seeking permanent residence. Opt out of the Dublin treaty to allow the UK to return asylum seekers to other EU countries without considering their claim. Anyone who currently has the legal right to live, work, or study in the UK would not face deportation in the event of the country's withdrawal from the EU.Greens:  Progressively reduce UK immigration controls. Migrants illegally in the UK for over five years will be allowed to remain unless they pose a serious danger to public safety. More legal rights for asylum seekers.Taxes and the economyConservatives: Eradicate the deficit by 2018 and secure an overall budget surplus by 2019-20. Achieve this by spending cuts, not tax rises, while raising NHS spending. An income tax cut for 30 million people by 2020. Tax would start to kick in at £12,500 a year, instead of £10,500. This will cost £5.6bn. The higher tax rate, 40%, would start at £50,000 instead of £41,900, again by 2020, at a cost of £1.6bn. This will be paid for through £25bn in additional spending cuts and economic growth. No increases in VAT.Labour: Get the current budget into surplus and the national debt falling ""as soon as possible in the next parliament"". No additional borrowing for new spending. Reintroduce the 50p top rate of income tax for earnings over £150,000.  Cut income tax for 24 million people by bringing back the 10p rate, paid for by scrapping the Married Couples' Tax Allowance. Bring in a ""mansion tax"" on properties worth over £2m, to raise £1.2bn. A tax on bankers' bonuses. A 5% pay cut for every government minister. Push for UK overseas territories to be put on an international blacklist if they refuse to co-operate with a drive against tax avoidance. No increases in VAT or National Insurance contributions.Lib Dems: Raise the personal allowance - the point at which you start paying income tax - to £11,000 in April 2016 and then to £12,500 by 2020. ""Strict new fiscal rules"" to ensure the deficit has gone by April 2018, with the wealthy contributing the most. The Lib Dems invented the ""mansion tax"" but in contrast to Labour have set out how it would operate - along similar lines to council tax bands. There are also Lib Dem plans to increase capital gains tax - paid on profits from second homes or shares - from 28% to 35%. Impose an additional 8% rate of corporation tax on UK banks to raise an extra £1bn a year to help pay off the deficit.SNP: Oppose UK plans in the Infrastructure Bill which will allow oil and gas drilling and hydraulic fracturing beneath people's homes without consent. Invest in offshore wind farming. Support an international bank tax and limits to industry bonuses.Plaid Cymru: Build a Green Skills Construction College, specialising in green energy. Establish a publicly-owned energy company. Establish a publicly-owned Bank of Wales business investment bank. Enforce a living wage. Give devolved nations an equal say in institutions that affect everyone's lives, such as the Bank of England.UKIP: Increase the personal allowance to the level of full-time minimum wage earnings, about £13,500, by 2020. Abolish inheritance tax. Introduce a 35% income tax rate between £42,285 and £55,000, at which point the 40% rate becomes payable. Set up a Treasury Commission to design a turnover tax on large businesses. Cut foreign aid budget by £9bn a year. Scrap HS2. Save £8bn a year in membership fees by leaving the EU.  Lower the VAT rate charged on restorations to listed buildings.Greens: People earning more than £100,000 a year would pay 50% income tax. Wealth tax of 1% to 2% on people worth £3m or more. Renationalise the railways and energy companies. Scrap HS2. Allow councils to impose extra business rates on out-of-town supermarkets to fund small local businesses. Crackdown on tax avoidance by multinationals. Allow ""the current dependence on economic growth to cease, and allow zero or negative growth to be feasible without individual hardship"". Commit Britain to a ""zero carbon"" future. Cut rail and bus fares by an average of 10%. Enforce a cap on bankers' bonuses.The NHSConservatives:  Chancellor George Osborne says he will put an extra £2bn into frontline health services across the UK, which he described as a ""down payment"" on a plan drawn up by NHS bosses calling for an extra £8bn a year above inflation by 2020. In England, everyone would be able to see a GP seven days a week by 2020. Recruit 5,000 more doctors.Labour:  Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said Labour would commit an extra £2.5bn a year above Mr Osborne's plan. The money will come from three sources - a new ""mansion"" tax, clamping down on tax avoidance by big corporations and a new tax on tobacco companies. Patients in England would get a GP appointment within 48 hours and would not have to wait longer than a week for cancer tests and results. Scrap the Health and Social Care Act and end ""creeping privatisation"" of the NHS.  Integrate health and social care services into a system of ""whole-person care"". Give greater priority to mental health services. Replace the Cancer Drugs Fund in England when it runs out in 2016 with a £330m fund to improve access to innovative cancer drugs, surgery and radiotherapy. Recruit 5,000 more healthcare workers to help patients stay in their homes and introduce new safety checks to identify people at risk of hospitalisation. Prioritise child mental health by increasing the proportion of the mental health budget spent on children.Lib Dems: An extra £1bn for the NHS every year, to be funded by - amongst other things - making higher earners pay more tax on their shares. Half of this will go towards mental health. Ensure that spending on the NHS rises in line with growth in the economy. People who need therapy for conditions such as depression will be guaranteed treatment within 18 weeks. For young patients experiencing psychosis for the first time treatment will be provided within two weeks of being referred by a GP. This is all going to happen from April, with more mental health targets to follow if the Lib Dems return to government. Wants a cross-party review of the future of NHS funding.SNP: Reduce the number of senior managers in the NHS by 25% over the next parliament. Streamline the work of health boards. Real terms increases in year-on-year NHS spending.Plaid Cymru: Recruit 1,000 extra doctors to the Welsh NHS over two terms of a Plaid government. Offer financial incentives for recruiting doctors to areas and specialisms where there are, or are predicted to be, shortages. Encourage innovation and attract more research funding, in part by increasing research and development funding as government finance allows. Improve training for postgraduate doctors and stop them being used to ""plug gaps"" in staff rotas. More recruitment from within the EU to fill vacancies and using international doctors to staff the NHS while a new generation of Welsh doctors are trained.UKIP: An extra £3bn per year in NHS funding paid for by quitting the EU and through ""middle management"" cuts. Keep NHS free at the point of delivery. Stop any further use of PFI, and encourage local authorities to buy out their PFI contracts early where it is affordable to do so. Ensure all visitors and migrants who have been here for fewer than five years have NHS-approved medical insurance as a condition of entry to UK, with £200m of the £2bn saved to be spent on ending hospital parking charges in England. Bring back state-enrolled nurses and return powers to matrons. Monitor and Care Quality Commission to be replaced with elected county health boards. Stop spending £90m a year on gastric band and breast enhancement operations.Greens: Funding to be diverted away from centralised facilities towards community healthcare, illness prevention and health promotion.  Stop privatisation. Abolish prescription charges. Dedicated NHS Tax to go direct to the health service. Ban proactive recruitment of non-British NHS staff from overseas. A complete ban on the promotion of tobacco and alcohol products, including sponsorship.Security, defence and foreign affairsConservatives: Hold a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU by 2017, after negotiating the return of some powers from Brussels. Protect foreign aid budget. Replace Trident.Labour:  Push for reform of European Union and prevent Britain from ""sleepwalking"" towards exit. Commit in law to holding a Strategic Defence and Security Review every 5 years. Outlaw discrimination and abuse of Armed Forces personnel.Lib Dems: Campaign to reduce the number of Trident nuclear submarines. Push for greater European Union efficiency. SNP: Oppose nuclear weapons and push for removal of Trident submarines from Scotland. In 2010, proposed a Scottish Centre for Reconciliation and Conflict Resolution, to promote peaceful alternatives to armed conflict. Maintain 0.7% commitment to foreign aid. Enhanced role for Scotland within the UK in Europe, particularly in fisheries policy.Plaid Cymru: Honour commitment of 0.7% of budget used for foreign aid. Campaign for cancellation of developing countries' debts. Support the Fair Trade movement. Support the 'Tobin' or 'Robin hood' tax as a means of encouraging more responsibility and stability in the global markets. Reform the IMF and World Bank in order to improve regulation and accountability. Continue membership of the EU, but campaign for democratic reform. Support minority nations and minority language speakers around the world. Pass a Military Wellbeing Act to promote and safeguard the physical and mental health and wellbeing of military personnel.UKIP:  Leave the European Union. Remove the passports of any person who has gone to fight for a terrorist organisation and deport anyone who has committed a terrorist act. Cut foreign aid budget by £9bn. Create a Veterans Department to look after the interests of ex-service men and women.Greens: Referendum on Britain's EU membership. Want reform of EU to hand powers back to local communities. Boost overseas aid to 1% of GDP within 10 years. Scrap Britain's nuclear weapons. Take the UK out of NATO unilaterally. End the so-called ""special relationship"" between the UK and the US.  Stop EU-US free trade deal TTIP. JobsConservatives: Create three million apprenticeships to be paid for by benefit cuts.Labour: Guarantee a job for under 25s unemployed for over a year and adults unemployed for more than two years. As many young people to go on an apprenticeship as currently go to university by 2025. Create a million new high technology, green jobs by 2025. Ban ""exploitative"" zero hour contracts.Lib Dems: An extra £1 an hour for the lowest paid apprentices. Campaign to create a million more jobs.SNP: Introduce gender quotas on public boards. Living wage ""a central priority"" in all Scottish government contracts. Continue the 'small business bonus'.Plaid Cymru: Provide rates relief for small businesses. Increase the number and value of contracts from Welsh public bodies that go to firms within Wales.UKIP: Allow firms to offer jobs to British workers first ""without the fear of being sued for discrimination"".Greens: A national energy conservation scheme to create thousands of new jobs. The party wants to create ""sustainable jobs"" and promotes more local production of food and goods.Education Conservatives: Protect England's schools budget - from reception entry at age four or five to the end of GCSEs at 16 - in cash terms although funding per pupil will not keep pace with inflation. Pre-school and post 16 education not ring fenced. Convert up to 3,500 more schools judged by Ofsted to ""require improvement"" into academies. ""War on illiteracy and innumeracy"". State primary schools in England that repeatedly failed to have a proportion of year-six pupil pass times tables and writing tests be forced to become academies, or have sponsorship replaced if already an academy. Opposed to giving votes to 16 and 17-year-olds for UK-wide general elections and local elections in England.Labour:  Increase the overall education budget in England, including schools, nurseries, Sure Start and provision for 16-to 18-year-olds, by at least the rate of inflation, although per-pupil funding is not specifically protected, meaning some of the increase will be eaten up by rising pupil numbers. Parents of primary school children would be guaranteed childcare from 8am to 6pm. The amount of free childcare for three and four year olds would be increased from 15 to 25 hours a week. Compulsory sex and relationship education in all schools. Refuse to grant business rate relief to independent schools unless they can show a ""meaningful impact"" on state schools through a new School Partnership Standard, for example by lending teaching staff or assisting in university admissions procedures. Committed to extending the franchise to 16 and 17-year-olds in elections across the UK. Double the number of Sure Start childcare places to more than 118,000. Tighten up the rules on primary school class sizes to ensure they do not have more than 30 pupils.Lib Dems: Protect the education budget from cuts. Guarantee qualified teachers and a core curriculum set by independent experts, as well as compulsory sex education, in all state schools including academies and free schools. More money for disadvantaged school children and free childcare for all two year olds. A two-thirds discount on all local bus fares for young people aged 16-21. Supports lowering the voting age to 16 in all UK elections.SNP: Guaranteed free 30 hours of childcare a week for three and four-year-olds in Scotland, up from 16 hours. Maintain lack of tuition fees at Scottish universities, and offer financial support in grants and loans to students. Continue to build and refurbish schools. Lower voting age to 16 in all UK elections.Plaid Cymru: Introduce a compulsory modern foreign language GCSE in secondary schools and the teaching of modern foreign languages in primary schools. Look at ways to strengthen the teaching of Welsh history and culture. Oppose foundation schools, academies and free schools. Look at moving from a per-pupil funding mechanism to a funding model based on the catchment area. Will not support any further increases in tuition fees for higher education students, and will seek the abolition of tuition fees as and when public finances allow. Supports lowering the voting age to 16 for elections to the Welsh Assembly and the UK Parliament.UKIP: More grammar schools. Scrap sex education for children aged under seven. Scrap tuition fees for students from poorer backgrounds who take degree courses in the sciences, technology, maths or engineering. Greater emphasis on vocational education with new Apprenticeship Qualification Option. School governing boards must be made up of at least 30% parents of children at the school. Allow universities to charge same amount for EU students as non-EU students.Greens: End performance related pay for teachers. Replace Ofsted with an independent National Council for Educational Excellence. Bring Free Schools and Academies into local authority control.

Withdraw Jobseeker's Allowance from young people after six months unless they take part in ""community projects"". And 18 to 21-year-olds wouldn't be entitled to housing benefit. Ban on zero-hours contracts which stop people getting work elsewhere. Raise the personal allowance - the point at which you start paying income tax - to £11,000 in April 2016 and then to £12,500 by 2020, which means that if you work on minimum wage for 30 hours you will pay no income tax. Young people out of work, education or training for six months will have to do unpaid community work to get benefits. This will apply to about 50,000 18 to 21-year-olds. Universal benefits for pensioners, such as free bus passes, TV licences for the over 75s and the winter fuel allowance. will once again be protected. Labour: Freeze energy prices until 2017. Increase in the minimum wage from £6.50-an-hour to £8-an-hour by 2020. Rises in child benefit capped at 1% for the first two years of the next parliament. Winter fuel allowance would be withdrawn from the wealthiest pensioners. Repeal what the government calls the spare room subsidy, dubbed the ""bedroom tax"" by Labour.  A million interest-free loans to help people insulate their homes. Rail fares would be capped. Double the amount of paid paternity leave available to new fathers from two to four weeks, and increase statutory paternity pay to £260 a week.Lib Dems: Raise the personal allowance - the point at which you start paying income tax - to £11,000 in April 2016 and then to £12,500 by 2020 (the Conservatives are promising the same thing). Nick Clegg has said he would not accept Conservative plans to freeze working-age benefits without taxing the rich too. He hasn't said he would block welfare cuts altogether. Withdraw eligibility for the Winter Fuel Payment and free TV Licence from pensioners on the 40% rate of income tax. A ""yellow card"" system to deal with benefit claimants breaking the rules, rather than imposing sanctions without warning.SNP: Oppose cuts to in-work benefits. Support moves to extend paternity leave. Introduce a maximum combined withdrawal rate for benefits and reforms to employment support allowance and cold weather payments. Protect policies such as concessionary travel for older Scots.Plaid Cymru: Move away from complex and expensive means testing for child-related benefits. Continue to campaign for the introduction of a living pension during the period of the next parliament for those aged 80 and over. UKIP: Only pay child benefit for the first two children for new claimants. Increase the Carers' Allowance to the same level as Jobseekers' Allowance (JSA) and pay a higher rate of JSA if you've been in work and already made tax and National Insurance contributions. Prevent anyone taking up permanent residence in Britain unless they're able to support themselves and any dependents they bring with them for at least five years and stop them receiving benefits. Stop paying child benefit for children who don't live in Britain. Scrap what UKIP calls the ""detested bedroom tax"". Boost ""credit unions"".Greens: The party backs a Citizen's Income, a fixed amount of £72 income a week to be paid to every individual, whether they are in work or not, to be funded by higher taxes on the better off and green levies.  But in the short-term it would increase the minimum wage to £10 by 2020. Ban zero hours contracts. Axe the ""bedroom tax"". Abolish the work capability assessment and restore the level of the former disability living allowance. Scrap the government's welfare cap, which limits the maximum amount a household can claim annually to £26,000 a year."

2015-04-14,Elephant trap?,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32047998,"The campaign has not even got under way, yet in the space of a couple of hours we have now been treated to not only one election pledge, but to two. The prime minister ruled out raising VAT if re-elected - while Labour said National Insurance contributions wouldn't go up.Usually politicians fudge the question of tax rises.  When he was leader of the opposition David Cameron himself said ""we have no need to raise taxes"" - before hiking up VAT after polling day.Famously, John Major said he had ""no plans"" to put up the sales tax -  before his chancellor did just that.And when he appeared in front of the cross-party Treasury committee of MPs on Tuesday, the current chancellor seemed to be continuing that tradition.  Under repeated questioning, George Osborne said: ""The policies we have do not involve a VAT rise.""That formulation appeared to give him not so much wriggle room, but an entire wriggle mansion.Labour assumed their campaign warning of further VAT rises to come under the Tories was very much on the money.But George Osborne's allies are suggesting privately that he had, in fact, been walking Ed Miliband to the edge of an elephant trap, then beckoning the prime minister to push the opposition leader in.Ed Miliband's strategists fully expected Mr Cameron to repeat the chancellor's obfuscation on tax at the final Prime Minister's Questions of this Parliament. They would then have expanded on the theme, inviting the prime minister to answer other difficult questions - then say he wasn't being straight with the British people for avoiding them.But the Labour leader was completely wrong-footed when first the prime minister said he would rule out a VAT rise and then counter-punched, inquiring if Labour would now rule out an increase in National Insurance contributions.Ed Miliband dodged the question and what could have been downbeat Conservative benches, uneasy over the prime minister's announcement this week of his retirement plans, were given something to cheer.The reason Ed Miliband didn't respond is because he was holding the National Insurance pledge back for Labour's manifesto.But that soon became unsustainable - so the other Ed, the shadow chancellor Ed Balls, had to undertake a hasty round of the TV studios to do just that.When I spoke to him mid-tour, he put on a brave face. His view was that George Osborne, having raised VAT from 17.5% to 20%, wanted to give the issue a low profile - whereas the prime minister had now made the mistake of putting it centre stage. And he believed David Cameron's promise would be judged against his past VAT-raising performance.He defended Ed Miliband's reluctance to talk about National Insurance as he felt it would have been ""inappropriate"" to announce Labour tax policy at PMQs.So the prime minister - always a better tactician than strategist - can at least satisfy himself that he smoked Labour out on NI and disrupted at least one entry in their election campaign grid.But the exchange actually raised more questions than it answered.If the main parties are ruling out further potential sources of revenue, but still committing themselves to eradicating a £90bn black hole in the public finances, will they now be under more pressure during the election campaign to spell out in much greater detail exactly what they intend to cut?"
2015-04-14,Who's next?,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32031343,"David Cameron's declaration that he will not seek a third term in office if he retains power in May has immediately stoked interest in who might fill his shoes when he's gone. Here are the likely - and perhaps less obvious - possibilities.Claim? As chancellor of the exchequer he's the man in charge of the purse strings and master strategist - and reportedly the PM's favourite to succeed him, although he hasn't said as much. Mr Cameron's right-hand man has had an image makeover of late, with a new haircut and a diet to shed some pounds. And he has seemingly recovered from his ""omnishambles"" Budget in 2012, with his latest - and last Budget - of the parliament giving the Tories a lead in some polls. He's said to be well liked among Conservative cabinet ministers and backbench MPs, whose support is vital for any candidate wanting to take on the party leadership. He shas some work to do among grassroots Tory members, however, coming fifth in ConservativeHome's latest online poll of party members on future leaders.Latest odds: 10/1 (according to William Hill)What's he said? ""The prime minister leads a strong team but what you see from him is answering a direct question with a direct answer. I think that's really refreshing. He says he's going to serve that full five years so the real question facing the country now is do you want the strong leadership of David Cameron that's delivering zero inflation and record jobs or do you want the chaos and incompetence of Ed Miliband.""Claim? The longest-serving home secretary in 50 years, she is only the second Conservative woman to secure one of the top four jobs in government. In her role, she has talked tough on immigration and crime and taken on the Police Federation. And she is popular with Tory activists, consistently occupying either first or second place in ConservativeHome's online polls on future party leaders. There have long been claims of Mrs May positioning herself for the top job, with reported tensions between her and the prime minister. Critics say she lacks charisma and micro-manages - while some cannot forget her coining the now infamous ""nasty party"" phrase at a Tory conference in 2002, but supporters say she is a formidable operator, and have dubbed her Britain's Angela Merkel. Latest odds: 9/2What's she said? ""My view is very simple, David Cameron is a first class leader of the party and a first class prime minister and I hope he is going to be doing that for a very long time."" (Desert Island discs, 23 November 2014)Claim? The blonde bombshell and mayor of London who can seemingly reach voters that others in the party cannot. Casting aside a rather chequered past he steered the capital through the 2012 Olympics, launched the successful and popular ""Boris bikes"" and got rid of London's ""bendy buses"" in favour of the new Routemaster double deckers. Mr Johnson hopes to revive his Westminster parliamentary career at the general election. He has been tipped by many to take the helm of the Conservative Party, and has not discouraged the idea. Like Theresa May, he is also a favourite among the grassroots of the party, pipping her to the top spot in ConservativeHome's latest poll of party members on future leaders. (he's ahead by 2 points). Critics say the gaffe-prone politician is not the right man for the job, but his supporters point to his wide-spread appeal.Latest odds: 9/4What's he said? ""I think what David Cameron is saying is banal and obvious. There has already been a leader of the Conservative Party for ten years and he's done an outstanding job. What he's saying now is that he wants to serve through to 2020 and that is frankly what we need him to do... five more years is what this country needs. I'm not entirely certain I see what the story is. He was asked a straight question, are you going to serve a third term like Mrs Thatcher or Tony Blair and he said no, because he thinks that ten years on top of British politics is an incredibly long time.""Claim? A self-made millionaire and devotee of Margaret Thatcher, he is regarded as one of the Conservatives' fastest-rising stars. The Treasury minister-turned-culture secretary became the first of the 2010 intake of MPs to reach cabinet level, and the first Asian male Conservative cabinet minister. He's currently polling well among the Conservative grassroots, who voted him third most preferable leader in ConservativeHome's latest online future leader poll. David Cameron recently said he wants to see a British Asian prime minister in his lifetime.Latest odds: 12/1Claim? Currently holding one of the four great offices of state - foreign secretary - Mr Hammond's name has often cropped up whenever talk of leadership contenders has emerged. He has built up an impressive CV in government since the Conservatives came to power in 2010, being first awarded the job of transport secretary before his promotion to defence secretary where he stayed for three years. He's regarded by many commentators as being a potential candidate for the Tory right. He seems to have work to do among party activists, scoring only 4% in ConservativeHome's future leader poll.Latest odds: 12/1"
2015-04-14,Cereal number,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-magazine-monitor-31962592,"David Cameron has declared he won't seek a third term as prime minister, citing an advertising slogan for Shredded Wheat used in the UK more than 30 years ago. What's its enduring power, asks Justin Parkinson.The hotel kitchen staff are in disbelief. Someone in room 147 has ordered three Shredded Wheat. The maid transports them upstairs to find England cricketer Ian Botham waiting at a table, dressed in full whites.The maid leaves. Botham hides one of the Shredded Wheat under a napkin and winks to camera. Cue music, as the slogan ""Shredded Wheat. Bet you can't eat three"" appears.This advert and others featuring football manager Brian Clough and the actor Richard Kiel, who played Jaws in James Bond films, have not run for some time. Nestle, which owns the brand, says the last probably aired in 1984.But their message seems to have waned little. Telling the BBC he would only serve a limited time in Downing Street, David Cameron said: ""Terms are like Shredded Wheat - two are wonderful but three might just be too many.""The prime minister's reprise was unlikely to be accidental, says Thayne Forbes, joint managing director of the brand-valuation company Intangible Business. ""Everybody would empathise with the view that three Shredded Wheat would probably be too much,"" he says. ""The slogan suggests people shouldn't overdo it. It sounds modest and reasoned.""As marketing goes, it might seem counter-intuitive, as it discourages excessive consumption. But it also sounds honest and unexploitative.Other advertising slogans and themes are in wide use in public and political discourse. Examples include Marmite being a by-word for divisiveness - a ""Marmite person"" is either loved or hated. Cameron has twice referred to Ronseal - the woodcare product that does ""exactly what it says on the tin"". But Shredded Wheat, its best-known slogan having lain dormant for so long, appears to be used less often. The cereal, created in the US in the 1890s, has long been sold as good for the evolving British lifestyle. A newspaper advert in 1902 described it as ""a relief from the monotony of everlasting porridge"", while, by 1943, it was ""an ideal food for all war workers"". The 1980s saw an emphasis on ""simple, honest goodness"", while, in the 2000s, its long heritage and reliability was promoted.""It's a good association for Cameron,"" says Forbes. ""He must have been brought up on it, like lots of other people. It will be great marketing for Shredded Wheat to have the slogan used after so many years, too.""Subscribe to the BBC News Magazine's email newsletter to get articles sent to your inbox"
2015-04-14,Are you 'cosmopolitan'?,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32021853,"The rise of UKIP heralds the emergence of a new divide in British politics, with cosmopolitan voters on one side and non-cosmopolitan ones on the other, argues Jeremy Cliffe.We hear a lot about UKIP these days. The party stole the show at the local and European elections last year, then again in the autumn when it lured two Conservative MPs to defect.  In the past weeks alone there have been three much-discussed television programmes about the party: ""Meet the Ukippers"", ""Farage Fans and UKIP Lovers"" and ""100 Days of UKIP"". At the upcoming general election the party will probably increase its share of seats in Westminster - and will certainly affect the results in dozens of other constituencies by taking votes from the other parties. But ask some of those academics who have been watching UKIP's rise, and they will tell you that it is just one part of a bigger story. We are all used to the left-right divide in politics: a spectrum of different views on how much the government should tax, spend, regulate and otherwise intervene in the economy. But according to Dr Rob Ford of Manchester University, UKIP exists on a different axis, one to do with cultural rather than economic matters. This new political scale is ever more prominent in British political life.Radio 4's Analysis programmeOn the one end of it is what you might call a ""cosmopolitan"" philosophy: a relaxed, liberal attitude to issues concerning national identity (like immigration) and to questions of morality and lifestyle (like gay marriage). On the other end is a ""non-cosmopolitan"" outlook: more nationalist, socially conservative and less comfortable with social change, or in other words the ideological stance often associated with typical UKIP voters. This divide cuts across the left-right scale: there are cosmopolitan and non-cosmopolitan voters in both the Conservative and the Labour camps, which is why UKIP takes support from both.Lots of things are making this cosmopolitanism divide more important. One is that the old class-based, ideological conflict between left and right has declined. Dr James Tilley of Oxford University argues that politicians are partly to blame. The economic philosophies of the Conservative and Labour parties are so similar, he argues, that other, cultural issues are becoming more important. Another factor is the growing gap between the generations: the difference in outlook between the cosmopolitan young and less cosmopolitan, older voters is greater than it was in the past (partly due to the recent rise in levels of university education, which tend to correlate with liberal views). This trend presents the established parties with some difficult questions. As Dr Ford puts it, they ""have to try and deal with this rising value divide, particularly now that UKIP has mobilised it into the political debate."" ""They have to make a move,"" he adds, ""but any move that they make risks making their position worse with one or the other of these groups of voters."" Sound too cosmopolitan, and the parties risk losing supporters to UKIP. Try to ""out-UKIP UKIP"", and they could alienate their younger, more socially liberal supporters. So both are doing the political splits, trying to reconcile the cosmopolitans within their ranks with the non-cosmopolitans. Witness the tortuous attempts by Ed Miliband to sound tough on immigration without sounding too tough. Witness, too, the recent struggles of David Cameron to persuade social conservatives in his party that gay marriage can be an innately conservative institution. In the long-term, this divide will become less problematic. That is because over the years the country will tilt towards the cosmopolitan end of this new spectrum. So says Penny Young of NatCen, the research organisation that conducts the extensive British Social Attitudes survey. Various demographic factors explain this trend. The country as a whole is becoming more accepting of same-sex relationships. Younger voters are more relaxed about things like immigration and national identity than were previous generations when they were young, suggesting that the overall population will tilt in an internationalist direction over time. And ever more parts of the country are acquiring the ethnic and social diversity once confined to the inner cities, a trend that generally makes people more comfortable with immigration. According to Dr Ford the question is therefore: how should the main political parties navigate this period of transition? It would be wrong to simply abandon the swathes of voters at the less cosmopolitan end of the scale; voters who are usually older and more isolated than the average member of the population.Yet the politicians do need to adapt to the changing attitudes of British society and be honest with voters rather than pandering to views that, deep down, they do not share. This quandary may not decide the upcoming general election, but in the established parties savvy strategists with an eye to elections in 2020 and beyond are grappling with it nonetheless. That is a wise move."
2015-04-14,Dudley debate,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32015334,"I met Afzal Amin for the first time on Friday, but I already knew who he was. In Dudley North, the seat he was selected by the Conservatives to fight in the general election, Mr Amin had become hard to avoid. When I first looked at the local newspaper online, the pages were surrounded by ""Amin"" logos in the preferred Tory shade of blue.Not long after we met, he asked me to pose for a photo, snapped by one of his campaign team, and doubtless rapidly tweeted out to followers of the would-be MP.Perhaps no surprise that the man running such a disciplined operation has served in the army and been to Sandhurst. That was very much the message he delivered on Friday, as he addressed school and college pupils at a hustings in Dudley which I'd been invited to chair.There was combative debate, too, not least with his Labour rival, the MP Ian Austin. Both men knew the Dudley contest was critical for their respective parties; Ian Austin held the seat by just over 600 votes in 2010. Just as David Cameron was denied a majority by failing to take seats like this one, so Ed Miliband is unlikely to be in No 10 if Labour loses Dudley North.He was self-confident and fluent. The only obvious mis-step came right at the end, when he interrupted Vicky Duckworth, the Green candidate for the neighbouring seat. She expressed the opinion that politics often seemed to be about men shouting at each other; Mr Amin complained she was engaging in gender bias.A few weeks ago, one Conservative MP who knows him well and respects his talents, said Afzal Amin had warned him of the risks of over-confidence. He thought he risked running before he could walk.Well, he stumbled badly this weekend. Whatever the purpose of his contacts with the English Defence League - and he strongly disputes claims that he wanted them to hold a protest that would then be called off, for which he could then take the credit - the exposure has damaged him and, potentially, the prospects of his party re-taking the seat.In February, the EDL staged a rally against plans for a new mosque in the town. As the Mail on Sunday story makes clear, Afzal Amin pleaded with them beforehand not to hold that demonstration; but it went ahead anyway. It's what happened subsequently which will feature in Tuesday's disciplinary hearing.Over the weekend, I put his defence to a very senior Conservative source - that this was an attempt to broker a compromise in order to bring together a divided community. The arch response: Dudley isn't Kandahar.Nor do I think from my visits to the town, where I'm going to be based for the general election, will people in Dudley appreciate being painted as somewhere riven by racial discord.True, Dudley was the scene of one of England's earliest race riots. But that was in 1962. Although the controversy over replacing the mosque - currently in a converted school and inadequate for the numbers who want to worship there - has been running for a decade, community relations are generally good. Even those who don't want a new mosque didn't want the EDL protestors - nor to be fair the anti-fascist counter-demonstrators who followed them.As for the Conservative Party, the view of the national leadership is that you don't collaborate with the EDL. Not least because the Tories are still struggling to bury some historic baggage in the Black Country: Enoch Powell was an MP in Wolverhampton when he delivered his Rivers of Blood speech about immigration in 1968.Four years before that, there was the notorious election in Smethwick which the Conservatives were accused of winning by wooing white voters with an offensive rhyme suggesting who'd they'd get as a neighbour if they voted Labour. Afzal Amin grew up in Smethwick so he should be aware of that history. He was, until his suspension on Saturday, one of about 17% of Conservative parliamentary candidates who are not white. The party is proud of that, but it's still struggling to translate that into votes.Afzal Amin may believe that he can persuade the party to lift the suspension when he meets party officials on Tuesday. I have my doubts. Even if they accept his defence, will the other parties be so charitable? The allegations would follow him on the campaign trail, and make planned visits by cabinet ministers next to impossible.On Friday, just before the hustings in Dudley began, Afzal Amin gave me his business card. It introduces him as 'prospective member of Parliament Dudley North'. I think I'll keep it; it could yet become a collector's item."

2015-04-15,Bid to change Speaker election rules,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32061097,"A last-minute bid to change the way the Speaker of the House of Commons is elected is to be debated by MPs.Labour criticised the government motion, to be debated on the final day before the dissolution of Parliament, saying the Conservatives were ""trying to play politics with the speakership"".Under the proposals, a secret ballot would decide whether there should be a contested election for the post.MPs currently have to file through the division lobbies to cast their vote.This means it is clear who does or does not back the incumbent as Speaker.Labour's shadow leader of the Commons Angela Eagle raised the party's concerns in the House on Wednesday evening, questioning whether the motion was within parliamentary rules.Current Speaker John Bercow is - technically - one of them, but many Tory MPs have never liked him.They resent his personal style and some believe he is far from impartial in the way he conducts business in the Commons.Attempts by some to force a vote on his resumption as Speaker in 2010 came to nothing. There have been the occasional measured jibes at him from the prime minister. Other Tories reportedly went much further and formed a group whose members had all been reprimanded by him. But the Speaker is a reformer who believes passionately that the people who elect the members, and pay the bills, should come first.The last act of the coalition looks like being an attempt to unseat him. And they are very serious about it.One Tory MP fighting an important marginal seat had been cleared by his party to be away from Parliament but he is now staying for the vote, such is the importance of it.She told Deputy Speaker Lindsay Hoyle: ""It's just come to my attention that the government has tabled a motion for debate on the final day of this Parliament, with no notice whatsoever to myself as shadow leader of the House, proposing changes to the way in which the Speaker of this House is elected.""Procedural matters in this House, with no consultation with the opposition, no consultation with the chair of the committee itself, for debate in only one hour tomorrow.""Mr Hoyle said the motion had been ""rightly or wrongly"" agreed to on Tuesday, saying that ""business of the House is decided by the government, not by the chair.""A spokesman for Commons Leader William Hague said the motion had been tabled as a free hour had opened up in Thursday's business after the House of Lords approved the Modern Slavery Bill.The proposed change would apply when a Speaker wishes to continue in the post after a general election.Under the current rules, if the Speaker's re-appointment is objected to, a division is held, with MPs choosing to back or oppose the Speaker in the division lobbies.The replacement of this method with a secret ballot was suggested in 2010 by a committee of MPs, which said the public method ""can be seen as a deterrent to the House expressing its views honestly"".MPs will now debate whether this change should be made."

2015-04-15,MPs warn on growth of UK jihadists,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32059813,"Not enough is being done to prevent people leaving the UK to join Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, a group of MPs has warned.Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said Britain must win their ""hearts and minds"".The committee's report comes as the BBC launches a database tracking British jihadists in Syria and Iraq. It shows that many people left in clusters from certain UK areas - often due to friendships and peer groups. The MPs' report argued that preventative work with communities, families and international partners was ""vital"" and needs to be a top priority for the Home Office.  ""The number of cases being brought to public attention should ring alarm bells,"" said Labour MP Mr Vaz.  ""This must be a relentless battle for hearts and minds, and without a strong counter-narrative we are in danger of failing to prevent even more departures. We are at the edge of a cliff."" The BBC has been tracking the stories of the men, women, boys and girls who have gone to Syria and Iraq to understand why they go, where they go from and what happens to them. By analysing around 160 profiles, it reveals the way in which people have travelled in clusters - a group of three young friends from Coventry, another group from Portsmouth, drawn out by one person they knew, others in Cardiff linked to people involved in an extremist organisation. Social media might play a part but face-to-face contact appears just as, if not more, important, according to the database.It includes the stories of: The BBC research emphasises the extent to which real-world contacts, rather than just online connections, are often a key driver of radicalisation and intent to travel to Iraq and Syria. Some of the experts who appeared before the Home Affairs Committee also argued the internet was a secondary influence. They said that universities and prisons were among the two most significant places where radicalisation occurred. A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police, which was not aware of the report, said it would have ""welcomed the opportunity"" to have given evidence to the committee and that it planned to look at the report in detail.The disappearance of schoolgirls Shamima Begum, Amira Abase, both 15, and Kadiza Sultana, 16, from east London in February, raised questions as to who could have done more to prevent their departure. After taking evidence from the police and the families of the girls among others, Mr Vaz said their case suffered from a ""lack of immediate action"". He added: ""Schools and the police must inform parents immediately, and work with them even if there is the smallest hint of radicalisation, or a close association with someone who is thought to have been radicalised.""However, the Met Police spokesman defended the speed of the police response to the schoolgirls' disappearance.  He said the committee's criticism was ""misleading"", pointing to the evidence given by both UK and Turkish authorities of ""rapid exchanges"" between the two.The committee's report said there needed to be an advice service which would be a less extreme step than calling the anti-terrorist hotline.The Association of Chief Police Officer's lead officer for the government's anti-terror strategy Prevent, Chief Constable Sir Peter Fahy, agreed that more needed to be done.However, he said the police ""do not have the capacity"" to routinely work with every school in the country.He added: ""The police service will play its part but the prime responsibility for dissuading young people from getting involved in extremist activity has to lie with parents, families and carers.""The committee also pointed to weaknesses in information sharing with airlines and other countries. It said greater care needed to be taken at airport check-in desks when people were travelling to destinations of concern - namely Syria, Somalia, Iraq and Nigeria, as well as neighbouring countries, such as Turkey. The report said police also needed to work faster to alert overseas partners and airlines when there were concerns over individuals.There were signs that some of the girls had followed extremist accounts on social media, the report said.The committee said that social media companies, such as Facebook and Twitter, should be prepared to suspend accounts when there is evidence they are being used to promote violent extremism.  The report also said it was disappointed the Home Office had not implemented a programme for individuals returning to Britain where there is evidence they had fought in Syria.Security officials estimate that some 600 Britons have left the country to join IS - and while around half may have returned, many are still out there - and some have died.  The BBC project includes detailed profiles of individuals which can be searched, based on hometown, age and gender, as well as those who have been convicted in the courts or who are believed to have been killed."

If not, the prince's private letters will either remain confidential, as the sender intended, or they'll be exposed to a large and inquisitive audience.

That will be a clear pledge from us.""He accused Mr Cameron of making an ""out of the blue, panicky"" announcement on VAT that ""no one in Britain will believe"".Labour, which has already announced plans to increase the top rate of income tax and impose a new ""mansion tax"" on high value properties, insists its plans are fully costed and will not require additional tax hikes if it wins May's general election.Mr Miliband began his final head-to-head encounter with Mr Cameron before the election by joking that the PM had ""announced his retirement plans"" - a reference to a BBC interview in which the prime minister said he would not serve a third term if the Tories remained in power.Challenging Mr Cameron to give a ""straight answer to a straight question"", Mr Miliband pressed him on whether he would rule out a rise in VAT after the election, as Labour had done.In response, the prime minister immediately said ""yes"", prompting loud cheers in turn from the Conservative benches. He contrasted what he said was a ""clear promise"" with Labour's unwillingness to rule out a rise in National Insurance.""I answered a very simple question about VAT. I ruled out an increase... straight answer to him, straight question from me. I have ruled out VAT. Will he rule out national insurance contributions. Yes or no?"" Mr Cameron added: ""We all know this is Labour's job tax. This is their tax of choice. This is what they clobber working people, families and enterprises with.""But Mr Miliband responded by saying there was ""only one person who is going to raise taxes on working families and that is him"".He said nobody would believe Mr Cameron on VAT ""because of his extreme spending plans, because his numbers do not add up and because he promised it last time and broke his promise"".Mr Cameron, he added, had broken other promises made before the last election to reduce annual net migration below 100,000 and not to pursue a major structural re-organisation of the NHS, adding that it was ""time for a better plan and time for a Labour government"".But Mr Cameron suggested a future Labour government would result in the ""chaos of economic crisis"", with Ed Miliband being ""held hostage"" by the SNP.The packed session provided a last opportunity for the two men to rally their MPs and set out their arguments before the start of the election campaign next week.Speaking after the exchanges and the other parties' tax pledges, deputy prime minister Nick Clegg said the Lib Dems ""don't need to raise VAT, national insurance or headline rates of income tax or corporation tax either"".""There are other taxes and other tax loopholes that we can increase or close in order to balance the books,"" he said.

2015-04-15,Met police 'had files on MPs in 90s',https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32044580,"A former undercover police officer has told BBC News that Scotland Yard kept intelligence files on MPs during the 1990s. Ex-Special Branch officer Peter Francis says he saw files on 10 Labour MPs which he and others regularly updated. He says he personally gathered information on three MPs as part of his work infiltrating left-wing groups. The MPs named, and Labour, have called for a forthcoming public inquiry into undercover policing to be widened. Mr Francis operated undercover between 1993 and 1997 in the Met's now disbanded Special Demonstration Squad. He was told to embed himself in left-wing groups or causes that were deemed to pose a potential threat to security. He says that during this period he was told to gather intelligence on MPs and their activities if and when they featured in any of his operations. That information, he says, was added to a special pink file that was available for Special Branch officers to read. Between 1990 and 2001, he claims to have personally seen records relating to Diane Abbott, the late Tony Benn, Jeremy Corbyn, the late Bernie Grant, Peter Hain, Harriet Harman, Ken Livingstone, Joan Ruddock, Dennis Skinner and Jack Straw.Four of the group became ministers during Mr Francis's time in Special Branch - including Jack Straw who was home secretary after 1997. ""When I was deployed undercover in the Special Demonstration Squad, any MP that I came across, such as on demonstrations, I would report back on them,"" he said. Mr Francis says that the files not only contained the MPs' publicly-stated political views - but also intelligence on what was going on behind the scenes in the party or their group. He says some of the information would have been things said in private by the MP, depending on how close each undercover officer had been able to get. Mr Francis said that when he first saw the files he understood that each had probably been created before the individual was an MP because of their personal involvement in radical causes or protests.But he added: ""When they became MPs these files carried on. It [was] your duty as an SDS officer to report back any intelligence that you come across. ""I felt that it was OK to report back on MPs,"" he said. ""I used to give myself a pat on the back, thinking 'I have done a good job'. These MPs were spied on and they should know.""""I don't think the police force should be monitoring MPs, full stop. I don't think we have any right to do that at all. It may be justifiable to say that the Security Service should be doing it - but I certainly don't think the police should be doing it.""Scotland Yard has refused to comment on the substance of the claims, but a spokesman said it had not shied away from serious allegations about the SDS. It said that Operation Herne, the internal police investigation into what happened in the unit, remained an ongoing investigation.""Operation Herne maintains that without speaking to Peter Francis it is simply not possible to fully investigate allegations he makes,"" said a spokesman. ""Operation Herne remains very willing to engage with him.""Mr Francis said that he has refused to speak to Operation Herne because he fears being interviewed under caution as a suspect, rather than a whistleblower. Scotland Yard told the BBC that Operation Herne detectives would be prepared to speak to him as a witness. He has, however, spoken to Mark Ellison QC who reviewed allegations about the SDS for the Home Secretary Theresa May - prompting her to launch a statutory inquiry. He says he will appear before those hearings. Peter Hain, who was a leader of the anti-apartheid movement in the late 1960s and 70s and became an MP in 1991, said he now wants full answers from Scotland Yard. ""I was deeply disturbed to find that files were still being kept by the Special Branch while I and others were serving Members of Parliament,"" he said. ""That is constitutionally an outrage. It infringes the sovereignty of Parliament. ""I want to see the home secretary widen the scope of the inquiry into the SDS to look specifically at the surveillance of MPs and the fact that there were active files on us while we were serving Members of Parliament. ""This should never have happened and it should have been reported and properly authorised - and we don't know whether it was.""Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper echoed the call for the inquiry to be widened in light of what she described as ""extremely serious and disturbing allegations"".""While undercover policing remains a crucial tool in combating serious and organised crime it must not be abused,"" she said.""There have now been a series of serious allegations about undercover policing - ranging from the treatment of Stephen Lawrence's family to police having long-term inappropriate relationships. ""We called some time ago for much stronger oversight of undercover policing and it is also vital to get to the truth about what has happened."" Mrs May announced earlier this month that Lord Justice Pitchford would lead the inquiry into the SDS allegations - but the precise shape of that inquiry is not yet clear.A Home Office spokesman said the review by Mark Ellison QC had unearthed ""serious historical failings"". ""That is why the Home Secretary established a public inquiry to thoroughly investigate undercover policing and the operation of the Special Demonstration Squad. ""Lord Justice Pitchford will consult interested parties to the inquiry over the coming months on setting the terms of reference, with a view to publishing these at the end of July.""Undercover policing is an essential tactic in the fight against crime but to improve the public's confidence in undercover work we must ensure there is no repeat of these failings in the future."""
2015-04-15,NHS problems worst 'since 1990s',https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/health-32057948,"Services in the NHS in England are deteriorating in a way not seen since the early 1990s, according to a leading health think tank. The King's Fund review said waiting times for A&E, cancer care and routine operations had all started getting worse, while deficits were growing.It said such drops in performance had not been seen for 20 years.But the think tank acknowledged the NHS had done as well as could be expected, given the financial climate.Professor John Appleby, chief economist at the King's Fund, which specialises in health care policy, said: ""The next government will inherit a health service that has run out of money and is operating at the very edge of its limits. ""There is now a real risk that patient care will deteriorate as service and financial pressures become overwhelming.""He said in terms of how standards were slipping - not how low they had reached - the situation was the worst it had been since the ""early 1990s"".The report noted much of the deterioration has happened in the second-half of the Parliament with many measures of performance being maintained in the first few years.It said the next government had to address the funding situation, adding the extra £8bn a year NHS England says is needed by 2020, was the ""minimum"" that would be required.The report - a review of performance this Parliament - highlights a range of problems as well as achievements. These include:The report is the second part of the King's Fund pre-election review of the NHS this Parliament.Last month it warned the coalition government's reforms of the health service had been ""damaging and distracting"".The King's Fund report should make worrying reading. The reference to the 1990s conjures up images of - for the NHS at least - a bygone era. The think tank's point was not that waiting times had reached the level they were at then, rather that this is the first time in two decades of almost continuous improvement that there has been a sustained drop in performance.In many ways, that had to happen. Services cannot keep getting better for ever. Nonetheless, the findings are crystal clear: the NHS is at a critical juncture. But what is less easy to determine is to what extent the coalition's policies have contributed to the difficulties.The think tank has already provided a critical analysis of the government's reforms - and when pushed, acknowledged the health service may have been ""in better shape"" if they had not happened.But the more significant issue for the health of the health service this Parliament has been the squeeze on finances. Even though the budget has been increased, it has felt more like a cut to many because demands have risen so quickly.On this though, the King's Fund accepted that the government's hands were tied. Given the state of the economy, ministers did as much as they could have.Read more from NickRoyal College of Nursing general secretary Peter Carter said politicians needed to take note of the warnings made by the King's Fund.""Morale is low, and more and more staff are being made sick with stress because of the intolerable pressure they are under,"" he added. Katherine Murphy, of the Patients Association, said: ""The findings echo what we are hearing on a daily basis on our helpline. It is clear to the public that the future of the NHS is one of the most important issues facing the nation and it should be a central issue in the election campaign.""Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham said: ""Five years ago David Cameron stood on a promise to protect the NHS. This report provides authoritative proof that he has broken that promise.""But a Department of Health spokesman said: ""As the King's Fund says, the NHS has 'performed well in the face of huge challenges', but if we are to continue to invest in the NHS going forward it needs to be backed by a strong economy.""

2015-04-15,SNP 'could block Tory government',https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32045419,"The SNP would block a minority Conservative government by voting down its Queen's Speech if it holds the post-election balance of power, its former leader Alex Salmond has said.Mr Salmond said the move could bring down the government if Labour joined in, with David Cameron ""locked out"".The Conservatives accused him of ""trying to sabotage the democratic will of the British people"".Labour has called his balance of power prediction ""bluster and bluff"".In recent days Mr Salmond, who is bidding to become a Westminster MP at the 7 May general election, has claimed his party could ""hold the power"" in a hung Parliament and would be able to influence the Budget of a minority Labour government.This was dismissed by Labour leader Ed Miliband, who has ruled out a formal coalition with the Scottish nationalists.The SNP currently has six MPs at Westminster, but recent opinion polls suggest its share could increase dramatically at the general election.James Cook, BBC News Scotland correspondentIf the Conservatives attempt to form a minority government and enough MPs vote against their Queen's Speech the administration would fall at the first hurdle and the leader of the opposition would have a shot at forming a government.That's how parliamentary democracy works in the event of a hung Parliament.And yet the Conservatives are saying that by planning to vote against a government he opposes Alex Salmond has ""confirmed he would sabotage the democratic will of the British people in order to make Ed Miliband prime minister"".It is part of their continuing attempt to portray Mr Miliband as a weak leader whose strings are being pulled by Mr Salmond.This kind of language causes despair among Tories north of the border who fear that the party in London is waltzing into an SNP trap.They know that many voters in Scotland will read the phrase ""democratic will of the British people"" and hear ""democratic will of the English people"".Because, if it is illegitimate for Scottish MPs, from whatever party, to vote against one government and support another in the British parliament, then what, voters may ask, is the point of the union?Who is dancing to Mr Salmond's tune now?Mr Salmond, the former Scottish first minister, told the New Statesman that in the event of a hung Parliament, a minority Conservative government would have to ""go straight effectively for a vote of confidence - usually the Queen's Speech, although it could be otherwise, of course - and we'd be voting against.""If David Cameron lost this vote, he said, there would be a two-week period for another government to be formed.BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said Mr Salmond had ""hardened his anti-Conservative rhetoric"" in the interview.A Conservative spokesman said:  ""Alex Salmond has confirmed he would sabotage the democratic will of the British people in order to make Ed Miliband prime minister. ""That would mean chaos for Britain, with weak Ed Miliband dancing to Alex Salmond's tune.""He said the ""only way to keep Britain together"" was to vote Conservative.Mr Salmond's latest comments come after Mr Miliband said the only people writing a future Labour Budget would be himself and shadow chancellor Ed Balls.Speaking in Clydebank on Monday, he added: ""It's not going to be Alex Salmond - not in a million years."""
2015-04-15,MPs criticise 'lack of EU debate',https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32045290,"The government's ""failure"" to let MPs debate EU legislation is ""deplorable"", a Parliamentary committee says.The European Scrutiny Committee said ministers had refused to schedule debates on issues such as free movement and the EU's Budget.It also said BBC coverage of EU matters should be ""improved substantially"".The government said the number of EU debates had doubled since 2009-10, while the BBC said its coverage was ""extensive and impartial"".The cross-party committee's role includes scrutinising EU documents and recommending the most important for debate in the House of Commons.Its report said in the period covering most of the 2014-15 financial year there were three debates on the floor of the House, compared with 12 in 2013-14.It also pointed out that not a single debate had taken place during a nine-month period, between 9 June 2014 and 9 March 2015.""The government's collective failure to schedule so many debates on EU documents over the past year is deplorable, and is a discourtesy to this committee and to all members of the House,"" the MPs said.Prime Minister David Cameron has sought to rally support from other EU leaders for his plans to curb welfare payments to European migrants ahead of a referendum on the UK's membership if he wins the general election.The committee said the government's ""cavalier"" approach was ""at odds with UK ministers' claims in their speeches across the EU about the role of national parliaments"".The Foreign Office said the government was committed to a ""strong EU scrutiny system that enables Parliament to hold it to account for the decisions taken in Brussels"".It added: ""We have made good on our commitment to raise standards by doubling the number of Europe debates on the floor of the House since 2009-10.""This government has also increased by around a fifth since 2010 the number of EU proposals that have been scrutinised and cleared by Parliament before being agreed in Brussels.""The committee has also been examining the BBC's coverage of European issues, taking evidence from director general Lord Hall and head of news James Harding earlier this month.During that appearance, Lord Hall said the desire for balanced output ""ran deep"" within the BBC and he believed that this was being achieved.Mr Harding said if the public was going to trust the BBC to report on politicians impartially it had to be clear that BBC journalists weren't ""asked by politicians to come and account for what they do and in effect do the bidding of those politicians"".But the committee said it was ""concerned about the manner in which the BBC treats EU issues"", calling for coverage to be ""improved substantially"".It suggested coverage did not reflect all sides of the debate on the European Union, and more analysis was needed. Its chairman, Conservative MP Sir William Cash, said the BBC had ""very particular obligations"" to be impartial and to ""educate and inform"".He added:  ""We do not believe this is currently being achieved in the context of the BBC's EU coverage.""A BBC spokesman said the corporation provided extensive and impartial coverage of European and Parliamentary issues, and it would be a breach of the corporation's independence if a committee of MPs instructed the BBC on its coverage."
2015-04-15,Lobbyists must 'conform' with rules,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32047992,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe woman in charge of the government's new register of lobbyists has said she expects the industry to ""conform"" with the statutory system. Speaking ahead of the register's launch, Alison White conceded a lot of lobbyists would not be listed on it.But she said her job was to make sure the rules were implemented and she would do so with ""extreme verve and vigour.""But one critic of the register said it was ""fake"" and full of ""loopholes"".Lobbyists are companies or individuals paid to influence government decisions.The coalition promised to introduce a statutory register of lobbyists when it came to power in 2010, and legislation was passed last year, with ministers saying the move would help clean up politics.However, the new register will only cover consultant lobbyists and will not apply to lobbyists working ""in-house"" for companies or organisations.A person or company will only need to be registered if they are contacting a government minister or permanent secretary in a government department - leading to criticism it will not come close to reflecting the scale or nature of lobbying that goes on across Whitehall.But Ms White, who is independent of the government, said her task was to implement the law as it stood not to question the powers she had been given. ""We are having something that has never been in place before,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""This is a statutory register. The industry tells me it is a professional industry. I expect them to conform with the legislation. It is my job to make sure they do so.""Ms White, who was appointed as the registrar of consultant lobbyists in September, acknowledged the register would not indicate different ""levels of lobbying"".""The legislation was quite narrowly drafted to address a particular issue, which was that it was not always particularly clear, when ministers were being lobbied, who the client of the lobbyist was. That is what the register was set up to do,"" she said.She added: ""This will give anyone who wishes to access the register the opportunity to be able to see who is lobbying and being paid for it and who their clients are. That is the main information the register will contain.""If a lobbyist sets out to influence government policy in some way, they would have to be registered. If they are not registered, then they would not be conforming. They have to go on the register before they lobby.""Ms White said last month that the register would not have any entries on its launch day but she had received more than ""20 expressions of interest"" about joining and companies and individuals might be required to sign up retrospectively.Potential registrants will be able to log on and create an account to file an ""information return"".But Tamasin Cave, from the Alliance for Lobbying Transparency coalition, said ""hardly anyone"" in the industry would be covered by the provisions of the new law. ""You have a huge commercial lobbying industry, and very few of them will have to sign up,"" she told Today.""The second flaw is that it won't show the interaction between lobbyists and government, and that is what a register is for.""It is to show the activity - who is discussing what with whom, but this shows nothing of this interaction. It is a fake register."""
2015-04-15,Car smoking ban MSP welcomes backing,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-south-scotland-32055226,"The Liberal Democrat MSP behind a bill to ban smoking in cars when children are present has welcomed the support of the Scottish government.South of Scotland MSP Jim Hume launched the members' bill in December.The government said it was ""very supportive"" of the principles of the bill, but changes could be needed to make it ""workable"".Motorists could potentially be fined £100 for breaching the rule if it becomes law.Mr Hume lodged draft proposals for a bill last May calling for a ban in Scotland on smoking in private vehicles when children under 18 were present.He said he was ""over the moon"" at the news the Scottish government would endorse the Smoking Prohibition (Children in Motor Vehicles) (Scotland) Bill.He said: ""With cross-party support and the support of many third sector organisations, there is every chance that this could be in place in the next year.""Eighty-four per cent of the 160 responses to my consultation were positive and people from across Scotland have expressed their support for the move.""The bill is about guaranteeing that children in Scotland can have the freedom to go on and lead healthy lives if they choose to.""I look forward to working with MSPs from all parties as the bill progresses.""Public Health Minister Maureen Watt said the Scottish government had considered including the measure in its Public Health Bill, but instead decided to support Mr Hume's proposals.She said: ""As with any bill, as it goes through the scrutiny process, there may be amendments and improvements to strengthen the legislation and ensure it is fit for purpose. ""But we believe that the underpinning principles are strong, and that is why I am pleased to support it.""Scottish Labour and a wide range of health organisations have backed his proposals.But the Scottish Conservatives have reservations about how the bill would work in practice.The party's health spokesman Jackson Carlaw said: ""While Scottish Conservatives support any moves which would protect young people from hazardous second hand smoke we have concerns as to how this would be enforced.""It would be a better use of resources to conduct a public awareness campaign similar to that which is being proposed by the government in Wales.""We will be watching this campaign in order to ascertain what lessons may be learned and what approaches may be adopted in Scotland.""Anti-smoking campaigners welcomed the Scottish government's backing for Mr Hume's bill.ASH Scotland's chief executive Sheila Duffy said: ""It is another public health initiative that can help Scotland move forward with its ambition to achieve a tobacco-free generation in 20 years' time.""It is popular with the public and will bring Scotland into line with upcoming legislation in England and Wales.""We believe it can be effectively enforced and that having the legislation focus on cars with children bypasses concerns over interference in people's private lives.""Jim Hume must be congratulated for taking the initiative on this proposal and for all the hard work he and his team have done to bring this important measure forward.""But Simon Clark, director of the smokers' group Forest, said the bill was ""legislation for legislation's sake"".He said: ""Smoking in cars carrying children is inconsiderate. The overwhelming majority of smokers know that and don't do it.""The very small number that do will carry on regardless because the law will be difficult, if not impossible, to enforce.""Education has to be better than legislation but the government prefers gesture politics and the big stick."""
2015-04-15,Candidate quits over UKIP MEP remark,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32038485,"A UKIP election candidate has quit the party over comments made by the party's only Scottish MEP about a Scottish government minister.Tim Wilson has decided not to stand in South Northamptonshire after David Coburn MEP compared Humza Yousaf to convicted terrorist Abu Hamza.Mr Coburn has apologised for the remarks, saying it was a ""joke"".A spokesman for UKIP said Mr Wilson had failed to emphasise local issues in his general election campaign.UKIP leader Nigel Farage said Mr Coburn's remarks were a ""joke in poor taste"" but he would not be taking any action against him.But Mr Wilson said he was disillusioned with the party over the ""racist jibes"" and has decided to stand down.He told BBC Scotland he was appalled by Mr Coburn's comments about Mr Yousaf and frustrated by the inaction of the party's leadership on the issue.  He said David Coburn had produced ""what I can only describe as an Islamaphobic insult, and that's simply not acceptable"".  Mr Wilson added: ""Of course he went on and apologised.  I think, frankly, that if you are in a position of power you have to be able to control what ideas emerge from your head and how they get to your mouth and, in fact, you shouldn't have those ideas in the first place.  ""But the real issue is that when Mr Farage was asked what he thought about this he dismissed this as a joke.  ""I don't think this is a joke. I think this is something very serious.  It may not be that this man intended to cause offence but we aren't interested in what his intentions are.  We are interested in the effect what he says has on other people and the effect is catastrophic, it's appalling and I've resigned.""In his resignation letter, Mr Wilson said he had been ""systematically gagged by the party whip"" and forbidden to speak about Islam favourably. A spokesman for UKIP said Mr Wilson had failed to put more emphasis on local issues in his campaign.He said: ""Whilst we had initially been optimistic about Tim Wilson's abilities as a candidate, it became obvious in recent weeks that he was out of his depth in representing our party in the way we would expect. ""Mr Wilson had clearly misunderstood the expectations that UKIP place on all of its candidates. Principal amongst those is focusing on issues that are relevant to local voters. UKIP put huge emphasis on local issues and Mr Wilson was unwilling to follow UKIP guidelines in this respect.""Last week MSPs at the Scottish Parliament unanimously condemned the remarks made by Mr Coburn during a newspaper interview.MSPs were debating a motion celebrating Scotland's diverse communities.The president of the European Parliament, Martin Schulz, condemned the remarks, saying they were ""not worthy of any elected member"". But a spokesman for the president said he could not act on remarks made outside parliament.The move comes just days after another candidate, Jonathan Stanley, quit in protest at the ""racist filth"" in UKIP. Mr Stanley, who was due to stand in the Cumbrian seat of Westmorland and Lonsdale, was the party's former head of policy in Scotland."

2015-04-15,Manifesto watch,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-29642613,"Political parties are putting together their manifestos for May's general election. Here's a guide to where they currently stand on the issues voters say they care about most (according to pollsters IPSOS Mori).ImmigrationConservatives:  David Cameron wants to make migrants wait four years before they can claim certain benefits, such as tax credits, Universal Credit, or get access to social housing. He wants to stop migrants from claiming child benefit for dependents living outside the UK, and remove those that have failed to find work after six months. Mr Cameron has promised to put reform of EU free movement rules at the heart of his renegotiation of Britain's relationship with the EU. He has ruled out a temporary cap on migrant numbers or an ""emergency brake"" on EU freedom of movement rules - ideas both mooted in recent months, saying this would be less ""effective"" than reducing the incentives for people to come to the UK. The party has a continuing goal to bring net immigration down to below 100,000 people a year (it currently stands at 243,000).Labour: ""Stronger"" border controls to tackle illegal immigration with ""proper"" entry and exit checks. ""Smarter"" targets to reduce low-skilled migration but ensure university students and high-skilled workers are not deterred. Employment agencies who only recruit abroad will be outlawed while the fines for employing illegal immigrants will be increased.Lib Dems: Reintroduce exit checks at borders, so the government can identify people who are overstaying their visa. Will require all new claimants for Jobseekers Allowance to have their English language skills assessed, with JSA then being conditional on attending language courses for those whose English is poor. Ensure that EU migrants have to ""earn"" their entitlement to benefits.SNP: Allow the devolved government to have control over immigration to Scotland, and introduce a Canadian-style earned citizenship system to attract highly-skilled immigrants.Plaid Cymru: Oppose a points-based system. Support the right of asylum seekers to work in Wales while they wait for status decisions to be made. Lobby the Westminster government to ensure that they shut ""detention"" centres.UKIP: Introduce an Australian-style points policy, used to select migrants with the skills and attributes needed to work in the country - covering people from inside and outside the EU. Bring net immigration down to 50,000 people a year. Priority lanes for UK passport holders. Increase UK border staff by 2,500. Tougher English language tests for migrants seeking permanent residence. Opt out of the Dublin treaty to allow the UK to return asylum seekers to other EU countries without considering their claim. Anyone who currently has the legal right to live, work, or study in the UK would not face deportation in the event of the country's withdrawal from the EU.Greens:  Progressively reduce UK immigration controls. Migrants illegally in the UK for over five years will be allowed to remain unless they pose a serious danger to public safety. More legal rights for asylum seekers.Taxes and the economyConservatives: Eradicate the deficit by 2018 and secure an overall budget surplus by 2019-20. Achieve this by spending cuts, not tax rises, while raising NHS spending. An income tax cut for 30 million people by 2020. Tax would start to kick in at £12,500 a year, instead of £10,500. This will cost £5.6bn. The higher tax rate, 40%, would start at £50,000 instead of £41,900, again by 2020, at a cost of £1.6bn. This will be paid for through £25bn in additional spending cuts and economic growth. No increases in VAT.Labour: Get the current budget into surplus and the national debt falling ""as soon as possible in the next parliament"". No additional borrowing for new spending. Reintroduce the 50p top rate of income tax for earnings over £150,000.  Cut income tax for 24 million people by bringing back the 10p rate, paid for by scrapping the Married Couples' Tax Allowance. Bring in a ""mansion tax"" on properties worth over £2m, to raise £1.2bn. A tax on bankers' bonuses. A 5% pay cut for every government minister. Push for UK overseas territories to be put on an international blacklist if they refuse to co-operate with a drive against tax avoidance. No increases in VAT or National Insurance contributions.Lib Dems: Raise the personal allowance - the point at which you start paying income tax - to £11,000 in April 2016 and then to £12,500 by 2020. ""Strict new fiscal rules"" to ensure the deficit has gone by April 2018, with the wealthy contributing the most. The Lib Dems invented the ""mansion tax"" but in contrast to Labour have set out how it would operate - along similar lines to council tax bands. There are also Lib Dem plans to increase capital gains tax - paid on profits from second homes or shares - from 28% to 35%. Impose an additional 8% rate of corporation tax on UK banks to raise an extra £1bn a year to help pay off the deficit.SNP: Oppose UK plans in the Infrastructure Bill which will allow oil and gas drilling and hydraulic fracturing beneath people's homes without consent. Invest in offshore wind farming. Support an international bank tax and limits to industry bonuses.Plaid Cymru: Build a Green Skills Construction College, specialising in green energy. Establish a publicly-owned energy company. Establish a publicly-owned Bank of Wales business investment bank. Enforce a living wage. Give devolved nations an equal say in institutions that affect everyone's lives, such as the Bank of England.UKIP: Increase the personal allowance to the level of full-time minimum wage earnings, about £13,500, by 2020. Abolish inheritance tax. Introduce a 35% income tax rate between £42,285 and £55,000, at which point the 40% rate becomes payable. Set up a Treasury Commission to design a turnover tax on large businesses. Cut foreign aid budget by £9bn a year. Scrap HS2. Save £8bn a year in membership fees by leaving the EU.  Lower the VAT rate charged on restorations to listed buildings.Greens: People earning more than £100,000 a year would pay 50% income tax. Wealth tax of 1% to 2% on people worth £3m or more. Renationalise the railways and energy companies. Scrap HS2. Allow councils to impose extra business rates on out-of-town supermarkets to fund small local businesses. Crackdown on tax avoidance by multinationals. Allow ""the current dependence on economic growth to cease, and allow zero or negative growth to be feasible without individual hardship"". Commit Britain to a ""zero carbon"" future. Cut rail and bus fares by an average of 10%. Enforce a cap on bankers' bonuses.The NHSConservatives:  Chancellor George Osborne says he will put an extra £2bn into frontline health services across the UK, which he described as a ""down payment"" on a plan drawn up by NHS bosses calling for an extra £8bn a year above inflation by 2020. In England, everyone would be able to see a GP seven days a week by 2020. Recruit 5,000 more doctors.Labour:  Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said Labour would commit an extra £2.5bn a year above Mr Osborne's plan. The money will come from three sources - a new ""mansion"" tax, clamping down on tax avoidance by big corporations and a new tax on tobacco companies. Patients in England would get a GP appointment within 48 hours and would not have to wait longer than a week for cancer tests and results. Scrap the Health and Social Care Act and end ""creeping privatisation"" of the NHS.  Integrate health and social care services into a system of ""whole-person care"". Give greater priority to mental health services. Replace the Cancer Drugs Fund in England when it runs out in 2016 with a £330m fund to improve access to innovative cancer drugs, surgery and radiotherapy. Recruit 5,000 more healthcare workers to help patients stay in their homes and introduce new safety checks to identify people at risk of hospitalisation. Prioritise child mental health by increasing the proportion of the mental health budget spent on children.Lib Dems: An extra £1bn for the NHS every year, to be funded by - amongst other things - making higher earners pay more tax on their shares. Half of this will go towards mental health. Ensure that spending on the NHS rises in line with growth in the economy. People who need therapy for conditions such as depression will be guaranteed treatment within 18 weeks. For young patients experiencing psychosis for the first time treatment will be provided within two weeks of being referred by a GP. This is all going to happen from April, with more mental health targets to follow if the Lib Dems return to government. Wants a cross-party review of the future of NHS funding.SNP: Reduce the number of senior managers in the NHS by 25% over the next parliament. Streamline the work of health boards. Real terms increases in year-on-year NHS spending.Plaid Cymru: Recruit 1,000 extra doctors to the Welsh NHS over two terms of a Plaid government. Offer financial incentives for recruiting doctors to areas and specialisms where there are, or are predicted to be, shortages. Encourage innovation and attract more research funding, in part by increasing research and development funding as government finance allows. Improve training for postgraduate doctors and stop them being used to ""plug gaps"" in staff rotas. More recruitment from within the EU to fill vacancies and using international doctors to staff the NHS while a new generation of Welsh doctors are trained.UKIP: An extra £3bn per year in NHS funding paid for by quitting the EU and through ""middle management"" cuts. Keep NHS free at the point of delivery. Stop any further use of PFI, and encourage local authorities to buy out their PFI contracts early where it is affordable to do so. Ensure all visitors and migrants who have been here for fewer than five years have NHS-approved medical insurance as a condition of entry to UK, with £200m of the £2bn saved to be spent on ending hospital parking charges in England. Bring back state-enrolled nurses and return powers to matrons. Monitor and Care Quality Commission to be replaced with elected county health boards. Stop spending £90m a year on gastric band and breast enhancement operations.Greens: Funding to be diverted away from centralised facilities towards community healthcare, illness prevention and health promotion.  Stop privatisation. Abolish prescription charges. Dedicated NHS Tax to go direct to the health service. Ban proactive recruitment of non-British NHS staff from overseas. A complete ban on the promotion of tobacco and alcohol products, including sponsorship.Security, defence and foreign affairsConservatives: Hold a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU by 2017, after negotiating the return of some powers from Brussels. Protect foreign aid budget. Replace Trident.Labour:  Push for reform of European Union and prevent Britain from ""sleepwalking"" towards exit. Commit in law to holding a Strategic Defence and Security Review every 5 years. Outlaw discrimination and abuse of Armed Forces personnel.Lib Dems: Campaign to reduce the number of Trident nuclear submarines. Push for greater European Union efficiency. SNP: Oppose nuclear weapons and push for removal of Trident submarines from Scotland. In 2010, proposed a Scottish Centre for Reconciliation and Conflict Resolution, to promote peaceful alternatives to armed conflict. Maintain 0.7% commitment to foreign aid. Enhanced role for Scotland within the UK in Europe, particularly in fisheries policy.Plaid Cymru: Honour commitment of 0.7% of budget used for foreign aid. Campaign for cancellation of developing countries' debts. Support the Fair Trade movement. Support the 'Tobin' or 'Robin hood' tax as a means of encouraging more responsibility and stability in the global markets. Reform the IMF and World Bank in order to improve regulation and accountability. Continue membership of the EU, but campaign for democratic reform. Support minority nations and minority language speakers around the world. Pass a Military Wellbeing Act to promote and safeguard the physical and mental health and wellbeing of military personnel.UKIP:  Leave the European Union. Remove the passports of any person who has gone to fight for a terrorist organisation and deport anyone who has committed a terrorist act. Cut foreign aid budget by £9bn. Create a Veterans Department to look after the interests of ex-service men and women.Greens: Referendum on Britain's EU membership. Want reform of EU to hand powers back to local communities. Boost overseas aid to 1% of GDP within 10 years. Scrap Britain's nuclear weapons. Take the UK out of NATO unilaterally. End the so-called ""special relationship"" between the UK and the US.  Stop EU-US free trade deal TTIP. JobsConservatives: Create three million apprenticeships to be paid for by benefit cuts.Labour: Guarantee a job for under 25s unemployed for over a year and adults unemployed for more than two years. As many young people to go on an apprenticeship as currently go to university by 2025. Create a million new high technology, green jobs by 2025. Ban ""exploitative"" zero hour contracts.Lib Dems: An extra £1 an hour for the lowest paid apprentices. Campaign to create a million more jobs.SNP: Introduce gender quotas on public boards. Living wage ""a central priority"" in all Scottish government contracts. Continue the 'small business bonus'.Plaid Cymru: Provide rates relief for small businesses. Increase the number and value of contracts from Welsh public bodies that go to firms within Wales.UKIP: Allow firms to offer jobs to British workers first ""without the fear of being sued for discrimination"".Greens: A national energy conservation scheme to create thousands of new jobs. The party wants to create ""sustainable jobs"" and promotes more local production of food and goods.Education Conservatives: Protect England's schools budget - from reception entry at age four or five to the end of GCSEs at 16 - in cash terms although funding per pupil will not keep pace with inflation. Pre-school and post 16 education not ring fenced. Convert up to 3,500 more schools judged by Ofsted to ""require improvement"" into academies. ""War on illiteracy and innumeracy"". State primary schools in England that repeatedly failed to have a proportion of year-six pupil pass times tables and writing tests be forced to become academies, or have sponsorship replaced if already an academy. Opposed to giving votes to 16 and 17-year-olds for UK-wide general elections and local elections in England.Labour:  Increase the overall education budget in England, including schools, nurseries, Sure Start and provision for 16-to 18-year-olds, by at least the rate of inflation, although per-pupil funding is not specifically protected, meaning some of the increase will be eaten up by rising pupil numbers. Parents of primary school children would be guaranteed childcare from 8am to 6pm. The amount of free childcare for three and four year olds would be increased from 15 to 25 hours a week. Compulsory sex and relationship education in all schools. Refuse to grant business rate relief to independent schools unless they can show a ""meaningful impact"" on state schools through a new School Partnership Standard, for example by lending teaching staff or assisting in university admissions procedures. Committed to extending the franchise to 16 and 17-year-olds in elections across the UK. Double the number of Sure Start childcare places to more than 118,000. Tighten up the rules on primary school class sizes to ensure they do not have more than 30 pupils.Lib Dems: Protect the education budget from cuts. Guarantee qualified teachers and a core curriculum set by independent experts, as well as compulsory sex education, in all state schools including academies and free schools. More money for disadvantaged school children and free childcare for all two year olds. A two-thirds discount on all local bus fares for young people aged 16-21. Supports lowering the voting age to 16 in all UK elections.SNP: Guaranteed free 30 hours of childcare a week for three and four-year-olds in Scotland, up from 16 hours. Maintain lack of tuition fees at Scottish universities, and offer financial support in grants and loans to students. Continue to build and refurbish schools. Lower voting age to 16 in all UK elections.Plaid Cymru: Introduce a compulsory modern foreign language GCSE in secondary schools and the teaching of modern foreign languages in primary schools. Look at ways to strengthen the teaching of Welsh history and culture. Oppose foundation schools, academies and free schools. Look at moving from a per-pupil funding mechanism to a funding model based on the catchment area. Will not support any further increases in tuition fees for higher education students, and will seek the abolition of tuition fees as and when public finances allow. Supports lowering the voting age to 16 for elections to the Welsh Assembly and the UK Parliament.UKIP: More grammar schools. Scrap sex education for children aged under seven. Scrap tuition fees for students from poorer backgrounds who take degree courses in the sciences, technology, maths or engineering. Greater emphasis on vocational education with new Apprenticeship Qualification Option. School governing boards must be made up of at least 30% parents of children at the school. Allow universities to charge same amount for EU students as non-EU students.Greens: End performance related pay for teachers. Replace Ofsted with an independent National Council for Educational Excellence. Bring Free Schools and Academies into local authority control.

Withdraw Jobseeker's Allowance from young people after six months unless they take part in ""community projects"". And 18 to 21-year-olds wouldn't be entitled to housing benefit. Ban on zero-hours contracts which stop people getting work elsewhere. Raise the personal allowance - the point at which you start paying income tax - to £11,000 in April 2016 and then to £12,500 by 2020, which means that if you work on minimum wage for 30 hours you will pay no income tax. Young people out of work, education or training for six months will have to do unpaid community work to get benefits. This will apply to about 50,000 18 to 21-year-olds. Universal benefits for pensioners, such as free bus passes, TV licences for the over 75s and the winter fuel allowance. will once again be protected. Labour: Freeze energy prices until 2017. Increase in the minimum wage from £6.50-an-hour to £8-an-hour by 2020. Rises in child benefit capped at 1% for the first two years of the next parliament. Winter fuel allowance would be withdrawn from the wealthiest pensioners. Repeal what the government calls the spare room subsidy, dubbed the ""bedroom tax"" by Labour.  A million interest-free loans to help people insulate their homes. Rail fares would be capped. Double the amount of paid paternity leave available to new fathers from two to four weeks, and increase statutory paternity pay to £260 a week.Lib Dems: Raise the personal allowance - the point at which you start paying income tax - to £11,000 in April 2016 and then to £12,500 by 2020 (the Conservatives are promising the same thing). Nick Clegg has said he would not accept Conservative plans to freeze working-age benefits without taxing the rich too. He hasn't said he would block welfare cuts altogether. Withdraw eligibility for the Winter Fuel Payment and free TV Licence from pensioners on the 40% rate of income tax. A ""yellow card"" system to deal with benefit claimants breaking the rules, rather than imposing sanctions without warning.SNP: Oppose cuts to in-work benefits. Support moves to extend paternity leave. Introduce a maximum combined withdrawal rate for benefits and reforms to employment support allowance and cold weather payments. Protect policies such as concessionary travel for older Scots.Plaid Cymru: Move away from complex and expensive means testing for child-related benefits. Continue to campaign for the introduction of a living pension during the period of the next parliament for those aged 80 and over. UKIP: Only pay child benefit for the first two children for new claimants. Increase the Carers' Allowance to the same level as Jobseekers' Allowance (JSA) and pay a higher rate of JSA if you've been in work and already made tax and National Insurance contributions. Prevent anyone taking up permanent residence in Britain unless they're able to support themselves and any dependents they bring with them for at least five years and stop them receiving benefits. Stop paying child benefit for children who don't live in Britain. Scrap what UKIP calls the ""detested bedroom tax"". Boost ""credit unions"".Greens: The party backs a Citizen's Income, a fixed amount of £72 income a week to be paid to every individual, whether they are in work or not, to be funded by higher taxes on the better off and green levies.  But in the short-term it would increase the minimum wage to £10 by 2020. Ban zero hours contracts. Axe the ""bedroom tax"". Abolish the work capability assessment and restore the level of the former disability living allowance. Scrap the government's welfare cap, which limits the maximum amount a household can claim annually to £26,000 a year."

2015-04-15,Elephant trap?,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32047998,"The campaign has not even got under way, yet in the space of a couple of hours we have now been treated to not only one election pledge, but to two. The prime minister ruled out raising VAT if re-elected - while Labour said National Insurance contributions wouldn't go up.Usually politicians fudge the question of tax rises.  When he was leader of the opposition David Cameron himself said ""we have no need to raise taxes"" - before hiking up VAT after polling day.Famously, John Major said he had ""no plans"" to put up the sales tax -  before his chancellor did just that.And when he appeared in front of the cross-party Treasury committee of MPs on Tuesday, the current chancellor seemed to be continuing that tradition.  Under repeated questioning, George Osborne said: ""The policies we have do not involve a VAT rise.""That formulation appeared to give him not so much wriggle room, but an entire wriggle mansion.Labour assumed their campaign warning of further VAT rises to come under the Tories was very much on the money.But George Osborne's allies are suggesting privately that he had, in fact, been walking Ed Miliband to the edge of an elephant trap, then beckoning the prime minister to push the opposition leader in.Ed Miliband's strategists fully expected Mr Cameron to repeat the chancellor's obfuscation on tax at the final Prime Minister's Questions of this Parliament. They would then have expanded on the theme, inviting the prime minister to answer other difficult questions - then say he wasn't being straight with the British people for avoiding them.But the Labour leader was completely wrong-footed when first the prime minister said he would rule out a VAT rise and then counter-punched, inquiring if Labour would now rule out an increase in National Insurance contributions.Ed Miliband dodged the question and what could have been downbeat Conservative benches, uneasy over the prime minister's announcement this week of his retirement plans, were given something to cheer.The reason Ed Miliband didn't respond is because he was holding the National Insurance pledge back for Labour's manifesto.But that soon became unsustainable - so the other Ed, the shadow chancellor Ed Balls, had to undertake a hasty round of the TV studios to do just that.When I spoke to him mid-tour, he put on a brave face. His view was that George Osborne, having raised VAT from 17.5% to 20%, wanted to give the issue a low profile - whereas the prime minister had now made the mistake of putting it centre stage. And he believed David Cameron's promise would be judged against his past VAT-raising performance.He defended Ed Miliband's reluctance to talk about National Insurance as he felt it would have been ""inappropriate"" to announce Labour tax policy at PMQs.So the prime minister - always a better tactician than strategist - can at least satisfy himself that he smoked Labour out on NI and disrupted at least one entry in their election campaign grid.But the exchange actually raised more questions than it answered.If the main parties are ruling out further potential sources of revenue, but still committing themselves to eradicating a £90bn black hole in the public finances, will they now be under more pressure during the election campaign to spell out in much greater detail exactly what they intend to cut?"
2015-04-15,Who's next?,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32031343,"David Cameron's declaration that he will not seek a third term in office if he retains power in May has immediately stoked interest in who might fill his shoes when he's gone. Here are the likely - and perhaps less obvious - possibilities.Claim? As chancellor of the exchequer he's the man in charge of the purse strings and master strategist - and reportedly the PM's favourite to succeed him, although he hasn't said as much. Mr Cameron's right-hand man has had an image makeover of late, with a new haircut and a diet to shed some pounds. And he has seemingly recovered from his ""omnishambles"" Budget in 2012, with his latest - and last Budget - of the parliament giving the Tories a lead in some polls. He's said to be well liked among Conservative cabinet ministers and backbench MPs, whose support is vital for any candidate wanting to take on the party leadership. He shas some work to do among grassroots Tory members, however, coming fifth in ConservativeHome's latest online poll of party members on future leaders.Latest odds: 10/1 (according to William Hill)What's he said? ""The prime minister leads a strong team but what you see from him is answering a direct question with a direct answer. I think that's really refreshing. He says he's going to serve that full five years so the real question facing the country now is do you want the strong leadership of David Cameron that's delivering zero inflation and record jobs or do you want the chaos and incompetence of Ed Miliband.""Claim? The longest-serving home secretary in 50 years, she is only the second Conservative woman to secure one of the top four jobs in government. In her role, she has talked tough on immigration and crime and taken on the Police Federation. And she is popular with Tory activists, consistently occupying either first or second place in ConservativeHome's online polls on future party leaders. There have long been claims of Mrs May positioning herself for the top job, with reported tensions between her and the prime minister. Critics say she lacks charisma and micro-manages - while some cannot forget her coining the now infamous ""nasty party"" phrase at a Tory conference in 2002, but supporters say she is a formidable operator, and have dubbed her Britain's Angela Merkel. Latest odds: 9/2What's she said? ""My view is very simple, David Cameron is a first class leader of the party and a first class prime minister and I hope he is going to be doing that for a very long time."" (Desert Island discs, 23 November 2014)Claim? The blonde bombshell and mayor of London who can seemingly reach voters that others in the party cannot. Casting aside a rather chequered past he steered the capital through the 2012 Olympics, launched the successful and popular ""Boris bikes"" and got rid of London's ""bendy buses"" in favour of the new Routemaster double deckers. Mr Johnson hopes to revive his Westminster parliamentary career at the general election. He has been tipped by many to take the helm of the Conservative Party, and has not discouraged the idea. Like Theresa May, he is also a favourite among the grassroots of the party, pipping her to the top spot in ConservativeHome's latest poll of party members on future leaders. (he's ahead by 2 points). Critics say the gaffe-prone politician is not the right man for the job, but his supporters point to his wide-spread appeal.Latest odds: 9/4What's he said? ""I think what David Cameron is saying is banal and obvious. There has already been a leader of the Conservative Party for ten years and he's done an outstanding job. What he's saying now is that he wants to serve through to 2020 and that is frankly what we need him to do... five more years is what this country needs. I'm not entirely certain I see what the story is. He was asked a straight question, are you going to serve a third term like Mrs Thatcher or Tony Blair and he said no, because he thinks that ten years on top of British politics is an incredibly long time.""Claim? A self-made millionaire and devotee of Margaret Thatcher, he is regarded as one of the Conservatives' fastest-rising stars. The Treasury minister-turned-culture secretary became the first of the 2010 intake of MPs to reach cabinet level, and the first Asian male Conservative cabinet minister. He's currently polling well among the Conservative grassroots, who voted him third most preferable leader in ConservativeHome's latest online future leader poll. David Cameron recently said he wants to see a British Asian prime minister in his lifetime.Latest odds: 12/1Claim? Currently holding one of the four great offices of state - foreign secretary - Mr Hammond's name has often cropped up whenever talk of leadership contenders has emerged. He has built up an impressive CV in government since the Conservatives came to power in 2010, being first awarded the job of transport secretary before his promotion to defence secretary where he stayed for three years. He's regarded by many commentators as being a potential candidate for the Tory right. He seems to have work to do among party activists, scoring only 4% in ConservativeHome's future leader poll.Latest odds: 12/1"
2015-04-15,Cereal number,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-magazine-monitor-31962592,"David Cameron has declared he won't seek a third term as prime minister, citing an advertising slogan for Shredded Wheat used in the UK more than 30 years ago. What's its enduring power, asks Justin Parkinson.The hotel kitchen staff are in disbelief. Someone in room 147 has ordered three Shredded Wheat. The maid transports them upstairs to find England cricketer Ian Botham waiting at a table, dressed in full whites.The maid leaves. Botham hides one of the Shredded Wheat under a napkin and winks to camera. Cue music, as the slogan ""Shredded Wheat. Bet you can't eat three"" appears.This advert and others featuring football manager Brian Clough and the actor Richard Kiel, who played Jaws in James Bond films, have not run for some time. Nestle, which owns the brand, says the last probably aired in 1984.But their message seems to have waned little. Telling the BBC he would only serve a limited time in Downing Street, David Cameron said: ""Terms are like Shredded Wheat - two are wonderful but three might just be too many.""The prime minister's reprise was unlikely to be accidental, says Thayne Forbes, joint managing director of the brand-valuation company Intangible Business. ""Everybody would empathise with the view that three Shredded Wheat would probably be too much,"" he says. ""The slogan suggests people shouldn't overdo it. It sounds modest and reasoned.""As marketing goes, it might seem counter-intuitive, as it discourages excessive consumption. But it also sounds honest and unexploitative.Other advertising slogans and themes are in wide use in public and political discourse. Examples include Marmite being a by-word for divisiveness - a ""Marmite person"" is either loved or hated. Cameron has twice referred to Ronseal - the woodcare product that does ""exactly what it says on the tin"". But Shredded Wheat, its best-known slogan having lain dormant for so long, appears to be used less often. The cereal, created in the US in the 1890s, has long been sold as good for the evolving British lifestyle. A newspaper advert in 1902 described it as ""a relief from the monotony of everlasting porridge"", while, by 1943, it was ""an ideal food for all war workers"". The 1980s saw an emphasis on ""simple, honest goodness"", while, in the 2000s, its long heritage and reliability was promoted.""It's a good association for Cameron,"" says Forbes. ""He must have been brought up on it, like lots of other people. It will be great marketing for Shredded Wheat to have the slogan used after so many years, too.""Subscribe to the BBC News Magazine's email newsletter to get articles sent to your inbox"
2015-04-15,Are you 'cosmopolitan'?,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32021853,"The rise of UKIP heralds the emergence of a new divide in British politics, with cosmopolitan voters on one side and non-cosmopolitan ones on the other, argues Jeremy Cliffe.We hear a lot about UKIP these days. The party stole the show at the local and European elections last year, then again in the autumn when it lured two Conservative MPs to defect.  In the past weeks alone there have been three much-discussed television programmes about the party: ""Meet the Ukippers"", ""Farage Fans and UKIP Lovers"" and ""100 Days of UKIP"". At the upcoming general election the party will probably increase its share of seats in Westminster - and will certainly affect the results in dozens of other constituencies by taking votes from the other parties. But ask some of those academics who have been watching UKIP's rise, and they will tell you that it is just one part of a bigger story. We are all used to the left-right divide in politics: a spectrum of different views on how much the government should tax, spend, regulate and otherwise intervene in the economy. But according to Dr Rob Ford of Manchester University, UKIP exists on a different axis, one to do with cultural rather than economic matters. This new political scale is ever more prominent in British political life.Radio 4's Analysis programmeOn the one end of it is what you might call a ""cosmopolitan"" philosophy: a relaxed, liberal attitude to issues concerning national identity (like immigration) and to questions of morality and lifestyle (like gay marriage). On the other end is a ""non-cosmopolitan"" outlook: more nationalist, socially conservative and less comfortable with social change, or in other words the ideological stance often associated with typical UKIP voters. This divide cuts across the left-right scale: there are cosmopolitan and non-cosmopolitan voters in both the Conservative and the Labour camps, which is why UKIP takes support from both.Lots of things are making this cosmopolitanism divide more important. One is that the old class-based, ideological conflict between left and right has declined. Dr James Tilley of Oxford University argues that politicians are partly to blame. The economic philosophies of the Conservative and Labour parties are so similar, he argues, that other, cultural issues are becoming more important. Another factor is the growing gap between the generations: the difference in outlook between the cosmopolitan young and less cosmopolitan, older voters is greater than it was in the past (partly due to the recent rise in levels of university education, which tend to correlate with liberal views). This trend presents the established parties with some difficult questions. As Dr Ford puts it, they ""have to try and deal with this rising value divide, particularly now that UKIP has mobilised it into the political debate."" ""They have to make a move,"" he adds, ""but any move that they make risks making their position worse with one or the other of these groups of voters."" Sound too cosmopolitan, and the parties risk losing supporters to UKIP. Try to ""out-UKIP UKIP"", and they could alienate their younger, more socially liberal supporters. So both are doing the political splits, trying to reconcile the cosmopolitans within their ranks with the non-cosmopolitans. Witness the tortuous attempts by Ed Miliband to sound tough on immigration without sounding too tough. Witness, too, the recent struggles of David Cameron to persuade social conservatives in his party that gay marriage can be an innately conservative institution. In the long-term, this divide will become less problematic. That is because over the years the country will tilt towards the cosmopolitan end of this new spectrum. So says Penny Young of NatCen, the research organisation that conducts the extensive British Social Attitudes survey. Various demographic factors explain this trend. The country as a whole is becoming more accepting of same-sex relationships. Younger voters are more relaxed about things like immigration and national identity than were previous generations when they were young, suggesting that the overall population will tilt in an internationalist direction over time. And ever more parts of the country are acquiring the ethnic and social diversity once confined to the inner cities, a trend that generally makes people more comfortable with immigration. According to Dr Ford the question is therefore: how should the main political parties navigate this period of transition? It would be wrong to simply abandon the swathes of voters at the less cosmopolitan end of the scale; voters who are usually older and more isolated than the average member of the population.Yet the politicians do need to adapt to the changing attitudes of British society and be honest with voters rather than pandering to views that, deep down, they do not share. This quandary may not decide the upcoming general election, but in the established parties savvy strategists with an eye to elections in 2020 and beyond are grappling with it nonetheless. That is a wise move."
2015-04-15,Dudley debate,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32015334,"I met Afzal Amin for the first time on Friday, but I already knew who he was. In Dudley North, the seat he was selected by the Conservatives to fight in the general election, Mr Amin had become hard to avoid. When I first looked at the local newspaper online, the pages were surrounded by ""Amin"" logos in the preferred Tory shade of blue.Not long after we met, he asked me to pose for a photo, snapped by one of his campaign team, and doubtless rapidly tweeted out to followers of the would-be MP.Perhaps no surprise that the man running such a disciplined operation has served in the army and been to Sandhurst. That was very much the message he delivered on Friday, as he addressed school and college pupils at a hustings in Dudley which I'd been invited to chair.There was combative debate, too, not least with his Labour rival, the MP Ian Austin. Both men knew the Dudley contest was critical for their respective parties; Ian Austin held the seat by just over 600 votes in 2010. Just as David Cameron was denied a majority by failing to take seats like this one, so Ed Miliband is unlikely to be in No 10 if Labour loses Dudley North.He was self-confident and fluent. The only obvious mis-step came right at the end, when he interrupted Vicky Duckworth, the Green candidate for the neighbouring seat. She expressed the opinion that politics often seemed to be about men shouting at each other; Mr Amin complained she was engaging in gender bias.A few weeks ago, one Conservative MP who knows him well and respects his talents, said Afzal Amin had warned him of the risks of over-confidence. He thought he risked running before he could walk.Well, he stumbled badly this weekend. Whatever the purpose of his contacts with the English Defence League - and he strongly disputes claims that he wanted them to hold a protest that would then be called off, for which he could then take the credit - the exposure has damaged him and, potentially, the prospects of his party re-taking the seat.In February, the EDL staged a rally against plans for a new mosque in the town. As the Mail on Sunday story makes clear, Afzal Amin pleaded with them beforehand not to hold that demonstration; but it went ahead anyway. It's what happened subsequently which will feature in Tuesday's disciplinary hearing.Over the weekend, I put his defence to a very senior Conservative source - that this was an attempt to broker a compromise in order to bring together a divided community. The arch response: Dudley isn't Kandahar.Nor do I think from my visits to the town, where I'm going to be based for the general election, will people in Dudley appreciate being painted as somewhere riven by racial discord.True, Dudley was the scene of one of England's earliest race riots. But that was in 1962. Although the controversy over replacing the mosque - currently in a converted school and inadequate for the numbers who want to worship there - has been running for a decade, community relations are generally good. Even those who don't want a new mosque didn't want the EDL protestors - nor to be fair the anti-fascist counter-demonstrators who followed them.As for the Conservative Party, the view of the national leadership is that you don't collaborate with the EDL. Not least because the Tories are still struggling to bury some historic baggage in the Black Country: Enoch Powell was an MP in Wolverhampton when he delivered his Rivers of Blood speech about immigration in 1968.Four years before that, there was the notorious election in Smethwick which the Conservatives were accused of winning by wooing white voters with an offensive rhyme suggesting who'd they'd get as a neighbour if they voted Labour. Afzal Amin grew up in Smethwick so he should be aware of that history. He was, until his suspension on Saturday, one of about 17% of Conservative parliamentary candidates who are not white. The party is proud of that, but it's still struggling to translate that into votes.Afzal Amin may believe that he can persuade the party to lift the suspension when he meets party officials on Tuesday. I have my doubts. Even if they accept his defence, will the other parties be so charitable? The allegations would follow him on the campaign trail, and make planned visits by cabinet ministers next to impossible.On Friday, just before the hustings in Dudley began, Afzal Amin gave me his business card. It introduces him as 'prospective member of Parliament Dudley North'. I think I'll keep it; it could yet become a collector's item."

2015-04-16,Bid to change Speaker election rules,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32061097,"A last-minute bid to change the way the Speaker of the House of Commons is elected is to be debated by MPs.Labour criticised the government motion, to be debated on the final day before the dissolution of Parliament, saying the Conservatives were ""trying to play politics with the speakership"".Under the proposals, a secret ballot would decide whether there should be a contested election for the post.MPs currently have to file through the division lobbies to cast their vote.This means it is clear who does or does not back the incumbent as Speaker.Labour's shadow leader of the Commons Angela Eagle raised the party's concerns in the House on Wednesday evening, questioning whether the motion was within parliamentary rules.Current Speaker John Bercow is - technically - one of them, but many Tory MPs have never liked him.They resent his personal style and some believe he is far from impartial in the way he conducts business in the Commons.Attempts by some to force a vote on his resumption as Speaker in 2010 came to nothing. There have been the occasional measured jibes at him from the prime minister. Other Tories reportedly went much further and formed a group whose members had all been reprimanded by him. But the Speaker is a reformer who believes passionately that the people who elect the members, and pay the bills, should come first.The last act of the coalition looks like being an attempt to unseat him. And they are very serious about it.One Tory MP fighting an important marginal seat had been cleared by his party to be away from Parliament but he is now staying for the vote, such is the importance of it.She told Deputy Speaker Lindsay Hoyle: ""It's just come to my attention that the government has tabled a motion for debate on the final day of this Parliament, with no notice whatsoever to myself as shadow leader of the House, proposing changes to the way in which the Speaker of this House is elected.""Procedural matters in this House, with no consultation with the opposition, no consultation with the chair of the committee itself, for debate in only one hour tomorrow.""Mr Hoyle said the motion had been ""rightly or wrongly"" agreed to on Tuesday, saying that ""business of the House is decided by the government, not by the chair.""A spokesman for Commons Leader William Hague said the motion had been tabled as a free hour had opened up in Thursday's business after the House of Lords approved the Modern Slavery Bill.The proposed change would apply when a Speaker wishes to continue in the post after a general election.Under the current rules, if the Speaker's re-appointment is objected to, a division is held, with MPs choosing to back or oppose the Speaker in the division lobbies.The replacement of this method with a secret ballot was suggested in 2010 by a committee of MPs, which said the public method ""can be seen as a deterrent to the House expressing its views honestly"".MPs will now debate whether this change should be made."

2015-04-16,MPs warn on growth of UK jihadists,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32059813,"Not enough is being done to prevent people leaving the UK to join Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, a group of MPs has warned.Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said Britain must win their ""hearts and minds"".The committee's report comes as the BBC launches a database tracking British jihadists in Syria and Iraq. It shows that many people left in clusters from certain UK areas - often due to friendships and peer groups. The MPs' report argued that preventative work with communities, families and international partners was ""vital"" and needs to be a top priority for the Home Office.  ""The number of cases being brought to public attention should ring alarm bells,"" said Labour MP Mr Vaz.  ""This must be a relentless battle for hearts and minds, and without a strong counter-narrative we are in danger of failing to prevent even more departures. We are at the edge of a cliff."" The BBC has been tracking the stories of the men, women, boys and girls who have gone to Syria and Iraq to understand why they go, where they go from and what happens to them. By analysing around 160 profiles, it reveals the way in which people have travelled in clusters - a group of three young friends from Coventry, another group from Portsmouth, drawn out by one person they knew, others in Cardiff linked to people involved in an extremist organisation. Social media might play a part but face-to-face contact appears just as, if not more, important, according to the database.It includes the stories of: The BBC research emphasises the extent to which real-world contacts, rather than just online connections, are often a key driver of radicalisation and intent to travel to Iraq and Syria. Some of the experts who appeared before the Home Affairs Committee also argued the internet was a secondary influence. They said that universities and prisons were among the two most significant places where radicalisation occurred. A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police, which was not aware of the report, said it would have ""welcomed the opportunity"" to have given evidence to the committee and that it planned to look at the report in detail.The disappearance of schoolgirls Shamima Begum, Amira Abase, both 15, and Kadiza Sultana, 16, from east London in February, raised questions as to who could have done more to prevent their departure. After taking evidence from the police and the families of the girls among others, Mr Vaz said their case suffered from a ""lack of immediate action"". He added: ""Schools and the police must inform parents immediately, and work with them even if there is the smallest hint of radicalisation, or a close association with someone who is thought to have been radicalised.""However, the Met Police spokesman defended the speed of the police response to the schoolgirls' disappearance.  He said the committee's criticism was ""misleading"", pointing to the evidence given by both UK and Turkish authorities of ""rapid exchanges"" between the two.The committee's report said there needed to be an advice service which would be a less extreme step than calling the anti-terrorist hotline.The Association of Chief Police Officer's lead officer for the government's anti-terror strategy Prevent, Chief Constable Sir Peter Fahy, agreed that more needed to be done.However, he said the police ""do not have the capacity"" to routinely work with every school in the country.He added: ""The police service will play its part but the prime responsibility for dissuading young people from getting involved in extremist activity has to lie with parents, families and carers.""The committee also pointed to weaknesses in information sharing with airlines and other countries. It said greater care needed to be taken at airport check-in desks when people were travelling to destinations of concern - namely Syria, Somalia, Iraq and Nigeria, as well as neighbouring countries, such as Turkey. The report said police also needed to work faster to alert overseas partners and airlines when there were concerns over individuals.There were signs that some of the girls had followed extremist accounts on social media, the report said.The committee said that social media companies, such as Facebook and Twitter, should be prepared to suspend accounts when there is evidence they are being used to promote violent extremism.  The report also said it was disappointed the Home Office had not implemented a programme for individuals returning to Britain where there is evidence they had fought in Syria.Security officials estimate that some 600 Britons have left the country to join IS - and while around half may have returned, many are still out there - and some have died.  The BBC project includes detailed profiles of individuals which can be searched, based on hometown, age and gender, as well as those who have been convicted in the courts or who are believed to have been killed."

If not, the prince's private letters will either remain confidential, as the sender intended, or they'll be exposed to a large and inquisitive audience.

That will be a clear pledge from us.""He accused Mr Cameron of making an ""out of the blue, panicky"" announcement on VAT that ""no one in Britain will believe"".Labour, which has already announced plans to increase the top rate of income tax and impose a new ""mansion tax"" on high value properties, insists its plans are fully costed and will not require additional tax hikes if it wins May's general election.Mr Miliband began his final head-to-head encounter with Mr Cameron before the election by joking that the PM had ""announced his retirement plans"" - a reference to a BBC interview in which the prime minister said he would not serve a third term if the Tories remained in power.Challenging Mr Cameron to give a ""straight answer to a straight question"", Mr Miliband pressed him on whether he would rule out a rise in VAT after the election, as Labour had done.In response, the prime minister immediately said ""yes"", prompting loud cheers in turn from the Conservative benches. He contrasted what he said was a ""clear promise"" with Labour's unwillingness to rule out a rise in National Insurance.""I answered a very simple question about VAT. I ruled out an increase... straight answer to him, straight question from me. I have ruled out VAT. Will he rule out national insurance contributions. Yes or no?"" Mr Cameron added: ""We all know this is Labour's job tax. This is their tax of choice. This is what they clobber working people, families and enterprises with.""But Mr Miliband responded by saying there was ""only one person who is going to raise taxes on working families and that is him"".He said nobody would believe Mr Cameron on VAT ""because of his extreme spending plans, because his numbers do not add up and because he promised it last time and broke his promise"".Mr Cameron, he added, had broken other promises made before the last election to reduce annual net migration below 100,000 and not to pursue a major structural re-organisation of the NHS, adding that it was ""time for a better plan and time for a Labour government"".But Mr Cameron suggested a future Labour government would result in the ""chaos of economic crisis"", with Ed Miliband being ""held hostage"" by the SNP.The packed session provided a last opportunity for the two men to rally their MPs and set out their arguments before the start of the election campaign next week.Speaking after the exchanges and the other parties' tax pledges, deputy prime minister Nick Clegg said the Lib Dems ""don't need to raise VAT, national insurance or headline rates of income tax or corporation tax either"".""There are other taxes and other tax loopholes that we can increase or close in order to balance the books,"" he said.

2015-04-16,Met police 'had files on MPs in 90s',https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32044580,"A former undercover police officer has told BBC News that Scotland Yard kept intelligence files on MPs during the 1990s. Ex-Special Branch officer Peter Francis says he saw files on 10 Labour MPs which he and others regularly updated. He says he personally gathered information on three MPs as part of his work infiltrating left-wing groups. The MPs named, and Labour, have called for a forthcoming public inquiry into undercover policing to be widened. Mr Francis operated undercover between 1993 and 1997 in the Met's now disbanded Special Demonstration Squad. He was told to embed himself in left-wing groups or causes that were deemed to pose a potential threat to security. He says that during this period he was told to gather intelligence on MPs and their activities if and when they featured in any of his operations. That information, he says, was added to a special pink file that was available for Special Branch officers to read. Between 1990 and 2001, he claims to have personally seen records relating to Diane Abbott, the late Tony Benn, Jeremy Corbyn, the late Bernie Grant, Peter Hain, Harriet Harman, Ken Livingstone, Joan Ruddock, Dennis Skinner and Jack Straw.Four of the group became ministers during Mr Francis's time in Special Branch - including Jack Straw who was home secretary after 1997. ""When I was deployed undercover in the Special Demonstration Squad, any MP that I came across, such as on demonstrations, I would report back on them,"" he said. Mr Francis says that the files not only contained the MPs' publicly-stated political views - but also intelligence on what was going on behind the scenes in the party or their group. He says some of the information would have been things said in private by the MP, depending on how close each undercover officer had been able to get. Mr Francis said that when he first saw the files he understood that each had probably been created before the individual was an MP because of their personal involvement in radical causes or protests.But he added: ""When they became MPs these files carried on. It [was] your duty as an SDS officer to report back any intelligence that you come across. ""I felt that it was OK to report back on MPs,"" he said. ""I used to give myself a pat on the back, thinking 'I have done a good job'. These MPs were spied on and they should know.""""I don't think the police force should be monitoring MPs, full stop. I don't think we have any right to do that at all. It may be justifiable to say that the Security Service should be doing it - but I certainly don't think the police should be doing it.""Scotland Yard has refused to comment on the substance of the claims, but a spokesman said it had not shied away from serious allegations about the SDS. It said that Operation Herne, the internal police investigation into what happened in the unit, remained an ongoing investigation.""Operation Herne maintains that without speaking to Peter Francis it is simply not possible to fully investigate allegations he makes,"" said a spokesman. ""Operation Herne remains very willing to engage with him.""Mr Francis said that he has refused to speak to Operation Herne because he fears being interviewed under caution as a suspect, rather than a whistleblower. Scotland Yard told the BBC that Operation Herne detectives would be prepared to speak to him as a witness. He has, however, spoken to Mark Ellison QC who reviewed allegations about the SDS for the Home Secretary Theresa May - prompting her to launch a statutory inquiry. He says he will appear before those hearings. Peter Hain, who was a leader of the anti-apartheid movement in the late 1960s and 70s and became an MP in 1991, said he now wants full answers from Scotland Yard. ""I was deeply disturbed to find that files were still being kept by the Special Branch while I and others were serving Members of Parliament,"" he said. ""That is constitutionally an outrage. It infringes the sovereignty of Parliament. ""I want to see the home secretary widen the scope of the inquiry into the SDS to look specifically at the surveillance of MPs and the fact that there were active files on us while we were serving Members of Parliament. ""This should never have happened and it should have been reported and properly authorised - and we don't know whether it was.""Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper echoed the call for the inquiry to be widened in light of what she described as ""extremely serious and disturbing allegations"".""While undercover policing remains a crucial tool in combating serious and organised crime it must not be abused,"" she said.""There have now been a series of serious allegations about undercover policing - ranging from the treatment of Stephen Lawrence's family to police having long-term inappropriate relationships. ""We called some time ago for much stronger oversight of undercover policing and it is also vital to get to the truth about what has happened."" Mrs May announced earlier this month that Lord Justice Pitchford would lead the inquiry into the SDS allegations - but the precise shape of that inquiry is not yet clear.A Home Office spokesman said the review by Mark Ellison QC had unearthed ""serious historical failings"". ""That is why the Home Secretary established a public inquiry to thoroughly investigate undercover policing and the operation of the Special Demonstration Squad. ""Lord Justice Pitchford will consult interested parties to the inquiry over the coming months on setting the terms of reference, with a view to publishing these at the end of July.""Undercover policing is an essential tactic in the fight against crime but to improve the public's confidence in undercover work we must ensure there is no repeat of these failings in the future."""
2015-04-16,NHS problems worst 'since 1990s',https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/health-32057948,"Services in the NHS in England are deteriorating in a way not seen since the early 1990s, according to a leading health think tank. The King's Fund review said waiting times for A&E, cancer care and routine operations had all started getting worse, while deficits were growing.It said such drops in performance had not been seen for 20 years.But the think tank acknowledged the NHS had done as well as could be expected, given the financial climate.Professor John Appleby, chief economist at the King's Fund, which specialises in health care policy, said: ""The next government will inherit a health service that has run out of money and is operating at the very edge of its limits. ""There is now a real risk that patient care will deteriorate as service and financial pressures become overwhelming.""He said in terms of how standards were slipping - not how low they had reached - the situation was the worst it had been since the ""early 1990s"".The report noted much of the deterioration has happened in the second-half of the Parliament with many measures of performance being maintained in the first few years.It said the next government had to address the funding situation, adding the extra £8bn a year NHS England says is needed by 2020, was the ""minimum"" that would be required.The report - a review of performance this Parliament - highlights a range of problems as well as achievements. These include:The report is the second part of the King's Fund pre-election review of the NHS this Parliament.Last month it warned the coalition government's reforms of the health service had been ""damaging and distracting"".The King's Fund report should make worrying reading. The reference to the 1990s conjures up images of - for the NHS at least - a bygone era. The think tank's point was not that waiting times had reached the level they were at then, rather that this is the first time in two decades of almost continuous improvement that there has been a sustained drop in performance.In many ways, that had to happen. Services cannot keep getting better for ever. Nonetheless, the findings are crystal clear: the NHS is at a critical juncture. But what is less easy to determine is to what extent the coalition's policies have contributed to the difficulties.The think tank has already provided a critical analysis of the government's reforms - and when pushed, acknowledged the health service may have been ""in better shape"" if they had not happened.But the more significant issue for the health of the health service this Parliament has been the squeeze on finances. Even though the budget has been increased, it has felt more like a cut to many because demands have risen so quickly.On this though, the King's Fund accepted that the government's hands were tied. Given the state of the economy, ministers did as much as they could have.Read more from NickRoyal College of Nursing general secretary Peter Carter said politicians needed to take note of the warnings made by the King's Fund.""Morale is low, and more and more staff are being made sick with stress because of the intolerable pressure they are under,"" he added. Katherine Murphy, of the Patients Association, said: ""The findings echo what we are hearing on a daily basis on our helpline. It is clear to the public that the future of the NHS is one of the most important issues facing the nation and it should be a central issue in the election campaign.""Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham said: ""Five years ago David Cameron stood on a promise to protect the NHS. This report provides authoritative proof that he has broken that promise.""But a Department of Health spokesman said: ""As the King's Fund says, the NHS has 'performed well in the face of huge challenges', but if we are to continue to invest in the NHS going forward it needs to be backed by a strong economy.""

2015-04-16,SNP 'could block Tory government',https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32045419,"The SNP would block a minority Conservative government by voting down its Queen's Speech if it holds the post-election balance of power, its former leader Alex Salmond has said.Mr Salmond said the move could bring down the government if Labour joined in, with David Cameron ""locked out"".The Conservatives accused him of ""trying to sabotage the democratic will of the British people"".Labour has called his balance of power prediction ""bluster and bluff"".In recent days Mr Salmond, who is bidding to become a Westminster MP at the 7 May general election, has claimed his party could ""hold the power"" in a hung Parliament and would be able to influence the Budget of a minority Labour government.This was dismissed by Labour leader Ed Miliband, who has ruled out a formal coalition with the Scottish nationalists.The SNP currently has six MPs at Westminster, but recent opinion polls suggest its share could increase dramatically at the general election.James Cook, BBC News Scotland correspondentIf the Conservatives attempt to form a minority government and enough MPs vote against their Queen's Speech the administration would fall at the first hurdle and the leader of the opposition would have a shot at forming a government.That's how parliamentary democracy works in the event of a hung Parliament.And yet the Conservatives are saying that by planning to vote against a government he opposes Alex Salmond has ""confirmed he would sabotage the democratic will of the British people in order to make Ed Miliband prime minister"".It is part of their continuing attempt to portray Mr Miliband as a weak leader whose strings are being pulled by Mr Salmond.This kind of language causes despair among Tories north of the border who fear that the party in London is waltzing into an SNP trap.They know that many voters in Scotland will read the phrase ""democratic will of the British people"" and hear ""democratic will of the English people"".Because, if it is illegitimate for Scottish MPs, from whatever party, to vote against one government and support another in the British parliament, then what, voters may ask, is the point of the union?Who is dancing to Mr Salmond's tune now?Mr Salmond, the former Scottish first minister, told the New Statesman that in the event of a hung Parliament, a minority Conservative government would have to ""go straight effectively for a vote of confidence - usually the Queen's Speech, although it could be otherwise, of course - and we'd be voting against.""If David Cameron lost this vote, he said, there would be a two-week period for another government to be formed.BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said Mr Salmond had ""hardened his anti-Conservative rhetoric"" in the interview.A Conservative spokesman said:  ""Alex Salmond has confirmed he would sabotage the democratic will of the British people in order to make Ed Miliband prime minister. ""That would mean chaos for Britain, with weak Ed Miliband dancing to Alex Salmond's tune.""He said the ""only way to keep Britain together"" was to vote Conservative.Mr Salmond's latest comments come after Mr Miliband said the only people writing a future Labour Budget would be himself and shadow chancellor Ed Balls.Speaking in Clydebank on Monday, he added: ""It's not going to be Alex Salmond - not in a million years."""
2015-04-16,MPs criticise 'lack of EU debate',https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32045290,"The government's ""failure"" to let MPs debate EU legislation is ""deplorable"", a Parliamentary committee says.The European Scrutiny Committee said ministers had refused to schedule debates on issues such as free movement and the EU's Budget.It also said BBC coverage of EU matters should be ""improved substantially"".The government said the number of EU debates had doubled since 2009-10, while the BBC said its coverage was ""extensive and impartial"".The cross-party committee's role includes scrutinising EU documents and recommending the most important for debate in the House of Commons.Its report said in the period covering most of the 2014-15 financial year there were three debates on the floor of the House, compared with 12 in 2013-14.It also pointed out that not a single debate had taken place during a nine-month period, between 9 June 2014 and 9 March 2015.""The government's collective failure to schedule so many debates on EU documents over the past year is deplorable, and is a discourtesy to this committee and to all members of the House,"" the MPs said.Prime Minister David Cameron has sought to rally support from other EU leaders for his plans to curb welfare payments to European migrants ahead of a referendum on the UK's membership if he wins the general election.The committee said the government's ""cavalier"" approach was ""at odds with UK ministers' claims in their speeches across the EU about the role of national parliaments"".The Foreign Office said the government was committed to a ""strong EU scrutiny system that enables Parliament to hold it to account for the decisions taken in Brussels"".It added: ""We have made good on our commitment to raise standards by doubling the number of Europe debates on the floor of the House since 2009-10.""This government has also increased by around a fifth since 2010 the number of EU proposals that have been scrutinised and cleared by Parliament before being agreed in Brussels.""The committee has also been examining the BBC's coverage of European issues, taking evidence from director general Lord Hall and head of news James Harding earlier this month.During that appearance, Lord Hall said the desire for balanced output ""ran deep"" within the BBC and he believed that this was being achieved.Mr Harding said if the public was going to trust the BBC to report on politicians impartially it had to be clear that BBC journalists weren't ""asked by politicians to come and account for what they do and in effect do the bidding of those politicians"".But the committee said it was ""concerned about the manner in which the BBC treats EU issues"", calling for coverage to be ""improved substantially"".It suggested coverage did not reflect all sides of the debate on the European Union, and more analysis was needed. Its chairman, Conservative MP Sir William Cash, said the BBC had ""very particular obligations"" to be impartial and to ""educate and inform"".He added:  ""We do not believe this is currently being achieved in the context of the BBC's EU coverage.""A BBC spokesman said the corporation provided extensive and impartial coverage of European and Parliamentary issues, and it would be a breach of the corporation's independence if a committee of MPs instructed the BBC on its coverage."
2015-04-16,Lobbyists must 'conform' with rules,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32047992,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe woman in charge of the government's new register of lobbyists has said she expects the industry to ""conform"" with the statutory system. Speaking ahead of the register's launch, Alison White conceded a lot of lobbyists would not be listed on it.But she said her job was to make sure the rules were implemented and she would do so with ""extreme verve and vigour.""But one critic of the register said it was ""fake"" and full of ""loopholes"".Lobbyists are companies or individuals paid to influence government decisions.The coalition promised to introduce a statutory register of lobbyists when it came to power in 2010, and legislation was passed last year, with ministers saying the move would help clean up politics.However, the new register will only cover consultant lobbyists and will not apply to lobbyists working ""in-house"" for companies or organisations.A person or company will only need to be registered if they are contacting a government minister or permanent secretary in a government department - leading to criticism it will not come close to reflecting the scale or nature of lobbying that goes on across Whitehall.But Ms White, who is independent of the government, said her task was to implement the law as it stood not to question the powers she had been given. ""We are having something that has never been in place before,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""This is a statutory register. The industry tells me it is a professional industry. I expect them to conform with the legislation. It is my job to make sure they do so.""Ms White, who was appointed as the registrar of consultant lobbyists in September, acknowledged the register would not indicate different ""levels of lobbying"".""The legislation was quite narrowly drafted to address a particular issue, which was that it was not always particularly clear, when ministers were being lobbied, who the client of the lobbyist was. That is what the register was set up to do,"" she said.She added: ""This will give anyone who wishes to access the register the opportunity to be able to see who is lobbying and being paid for it and who their clients are. That is the main information the register will contain.""If a lobbyist sets out to influence government policy in some way, they would have to be registered. If they are not registered, then they would not be conforming. They have to go on the register before they lobby.""Ms White said last month that the register would not have any entries on its launch day but she had received more than ""20 expressions of interest"" about joining and companies and individuals might be required to sign up retrospectively.Potential registrants will be able to log on and create an account to file an ""information return"".But Tamasin Cave, from the Alliance for Lobbying Transparency coalition, said ""hardly anyone"" in the industry would be covered by the provisions of the new law. ""You have a huge commercial lobbying industry, and very few of them will have to sign up,"" she told Today.""The second flaw is that it won't show the interaction between lobbyists and government, and that is what a register is for.""It is to show the activity - who is discussing what with whom, but this shows nothing of this interaction. It is a fake register."""
2015-04-16,Car smoking ban MSP welcomes backing,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-south-scotland-32055226,"The Liberal Democrat MSP behind a bill to ban smoking in cars when children are present has welcomed the support of the Scottish government.South of Scotland MSP Jim Hume launched the members' bill in December.The government said it was ""very supportive"" of the principles of the bill, but changes could be needed to make it ""workable"".Motorists could potentially be fined £100 for breaching the rule if it becomes law.Mr Hume lodged draft proposals for a bill last May calling for a ban in Scotland on smoking in private vehicles when children under 18 were present.He said he was ""over the moon"" at the news the Scottish government would endorse the Smoking Prohibition (Children in Motor Vehicles) (Scotland) Bill.He said: ""With cross-party support and the support of many third sector organisations, there is every chance that this could be in place in the next year.""Eighty-four per cent of the 160 responses to my consultation were positive and people from across Scotland have expressed their support for the move.""The bill is about guaranteeing that children in Scotland can have the freedom to go on and lead healthy lives if they choose to.""I look forward to working with MSPs from all parties as the bill progresses.""Public Health Minister Maureen Watt said the Scottish government had considered including the measure in its Public Health Bill, but instead decided to support Mr Hume's proposals.She said: ""As with any bill, as it goes through the scrutiny process, there may be amendments and improvements to strengthen the legislation and ensure it is fit for purpose. ""But we believe that the underpinning principles are strong, and that is why I am pleased to support it.""Scottish Labour and a wide range of health organisations have backed his proposals.But the Scottish Conservatives have reservations about how the bill would work in practice.The party's health spokesman Jackson Carlaw said: ""While Scottish Conservatives support any moves which would protect young people from hazardous second hand smoke we have concerns as to how this would be enforced.""It would be a better use of resources to conduct a public awareness campaign similar to that which is being proposed by the government in Wales.""We will be watching this campaign in order to ascertain what lessons may be learned and what approaches may be adopted in Scotland.""Anti-smoking campaigners welcomed the Scottish government's backing for Mr Hume's bill.ASH Scotland's chief executive Sheila Duffy said: ""It is another public health initiative that can help Scotland move forward with its ambition to achieve a tobacco-free generation in 20 years' time.""It is popular with the public and will bring Scotland into line with upcoming legislation in England and Wales.""We believe it can be effectively enforced and that having the legislation focus on cars with children bypasses concerns over interference in people's private lives.""Jim Hume must be congratulated for taking the initiative on this proposal and for all the hard work he and his team have done to bring this important measure forward.""But Simon Clark, director of the smokers' group Forest, said the bill was ""legislation for legislation's sake"".He said: ""Smoking in cars carrying children is inconsiderate. The overwhelming majority of smokers know that and don't do it.""The very small number that do will carry on regardless because the law will be difficult, if not impossible, to enforce.""Education has to be better than legislation but the government prefers gesture politics and the big stick."""
2015-04-16,Candidate quits over UKIP MEP remark,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32038485,"A UKIP election candidate has quit the party over comments made by the party's only Scottish MEP about a Scottish government minister.Tim Wilson has decided not to stand in South Northamptonshire after David Coburn MEP compared Humza Yousaf to convicted terrorist Abu Hamza.Mr Coburn has apologised for the remarks, saying it was a ""joke"".A spokesman for UKIP said Mr Wilson had failed to emphasise local issues in his general election campaign.UKIP leader Nigel Farage said Mr Coburn's remarks were a ""joke in poor taste"" but he would not be taking any action against him.But Mr Wilson said he was disillusioned with the party over the ""racist jibes"" and has decided to stand down.He told BBC Scotland he was appalled by Mr Coburn's comments about Mr Yousaf and frustrated by the inaction of the party's leadership on the issue.  He said David Coburn had produced ""what I can only describe as an Islamaphobic insult, and that's simply not acceptable"".  Mr Wilson added: ""Of course he went on and apologised.  I think, frankly, that if you are in a position of power you have to be able to control what ideas emerge from your head and how they get to your mouth and, in fact, you shouldn't have those ideas in the first place.  ""But the real issue is that when Mr Farage was asked what he thought about this he dismissed this as a joke.  ""I don't think this is a joke. I think this is something very serious.  It may not be that this man intended to cause offence but we aren't interested in what his intentions are.  We are interested in the effect what he says has on other people and the effect is catastrophic, it's appalling and I've resigned.""In his resignation letter, Mr Wilson said he had been ""systematically gagged by the party whip"" and forbidden to speak about Islam favourably. A spokesman for UKIP said Mr Wilson had failed to put more emphasis on local issues in his campaign.He said: ""Whilst we had initially been optimistic about Tim Wilson's abilities as a candidate, it became obvious in recent weeks that he was out of his depth in representing our party in the way we would expect. ""Mr Wilson had clearly misunderstood the expectations that UKIP place on all of its candidates. Principal amongst those is focusing on issues that are relevant to local voters. UKIP put huge emphasis on local issues and Mr Wilson was unwilling to follow UKIP guidelines in this respect.""Last week MSPs at the Scottish Parliament unanimously condemned the remarks made by Mr Coburn during a newspaper interview.MSPs were debating a motion celebrating Scotland's diverse communities.The president of the European Parliament, Martin Schulz, condemned the remarks, saying they were ""not worthy of any elected member"". But a spokesman for the president said he could not act on remarks made outside parliament.The move comes just days after another candidate, Jonathan Stanley, quit in protest at the ""racist filth"" in UKIP. Mr Stanley, who was due to stand in the Cumbrian seat of Westmorland and Lonsdale, was the party's former head of policy in Scotland."

2015-04-16,Manifesto watch,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-29642613,"Political parties are putting together their manifestos for May's general election. Here's a guide to where they currently stand on the issues voters say they care about most (according to pollsters IPSOS Mori).ImmigrationConservatives:  David Cameron wants to make migrants wait four years before they can claim certain benefits, such as tax credits, Universal Credit, or get access to social housing. He wants to stop migrants from claiming child benefit for dependents living outside the UK, and remove those that have failed to find work after six months. Mr Cameron has promised to put reform of EU free movement rules at the heart of his renegotiation of Britain's relationship with the EU. He has ruled out a temporary cap on migrant numbers or an ""emergency brake"" on EU freedom of movement rules - ideas both mooted in recent months, saying this would be less ""effective"" than reducing the incentives for people to come to the UK. The party has a continuing goal to bring net immigration down to below 100,000 people a year (it currently stands at 243,000).Labour: ""Stronger"" border controls to tackle illegal immigration with ""proper"" entry and exit checks. ""Smarter"" targets to reduce low-skilled migration but ensure university students and high-skilled workers are not deterred. Employment agencies who only recruit abroad will be outlawed while the fines for employing illegal immigrants will be increased.Lib Dems: Reintroduce exit checks at borders, so the government can identify people who are overstaying their visa. Will require all new claimants for Jobseekers Allowance to have their English language skills assessed, with JSA then being conditional on attending language courses for those whose English is poor. Ensure that EU migrants have to ""earn"" their entitlement to benefits.SNP: Allow the devolved government to have control over immigration to Scotland, and introduce a Canadian-style earned citizenship system to attract highly-skilled immigrants.Plaid Cymru: Oppose a points-based system. Support the right of asylum seekers to work in Wales while they wait for status decisions to be made. Lobby the Westminster government to ensure that they shut ""detention"" centres.UKIP: Introduce an Australian-style points policy, used to select migrants with the skills and attributes needed to work in the country - covering people from inside and outside the EU. Bring net immigration down to 50,000 people a year. Priority lanes for UK passport holders. Increase UK border staff by 2,500. Tougher English language tests for migrants seeking permanent residence. Opt out of the Dublin treaty to allow the UK to return asylum seekers to other EU countries without considering their claim. Anyone who currently has the legal right to live, work, or study in the UK would not face deportation in the event of the country's withdrawal from the EU.Greens:  Progressively reduce UK immigration controls. Migrants illegally in the UK for over five years will be allowed to remain unless they pose a serious danger to public safety. More legal rights for asylum seekers.Taxes and the economyConservatives: Eradicate the deficit by 2018 and secure an overall budget surplus by 2019-20. Achieve this by spending cuts, not tax rises, while raising NHS spending. An income tax cut for 30 million people by 2020. Tax would start to kick in at £12,500 a year, instead of £10,500. This will cost £5.6bn. The higher tax rate, 40%, would start at £50,000 instead of £41,900, again by 2020, at a cost of £1.6bn. This will be paid for through £25bn in additional spending cuts and economic growth. No increases in VAT.Labour: Get the current budget into surplus and the national debt falling ""as soon as possible in the next parliament"". No additional borrowing for new spending. Reintroduce the 50p top rate of income tax for earnings over £150,000.  Cut income tax for 24 million people by bringing back the 10p rate, paid for by scrapping the Married Couples' Tax Allowance. Bring in a ""mansion tax"" on properties worth over £2m, to raise £1.2bn. A tax on bankers' bonuses. A 5% pay cut for every government minister. Push for UK overseas territories to be put on an international blacklist if they refuse to co-operate with a drive against tax avoidance. No increases in VAT or National Insurance contributions.Lib Dems: Raise the personal allowance - the point at which you start paying income tax - to £11,000 in April 2016 and then to £12,500 by 2020. ""Strict new fiscal rules"" to ensure the deficit has gone by April 2018, with the wealthy contributing the most. The Lib Dems invented the ""mansion tax"" but in contrast to Labour have set out how it would operate - along similar lines to council tax bands. There are also Lib Dem plans to increase capital gains tax - paid on profits from second homes or shares - from 28% to 35%. Impose an additional 8% rate of corporation tax on UK banks to raise an extra £1bn a year to help pay off the deficit.SNP: Oppose UK plans in the Infrastructure Bill which will allow oil and gas drilling and hydraulic fracturing beneath people's homes without consent. Invest in offshore wind farming. Support an international bank tax and limits to industry bonuses.Plaid Cymru: Build a Green Skills Construction College, specialising in green energy. Establish a publicly-owned energy company. Establish a publicly-owned Bank of Wales business investment bank. Enforce a living wage. Give devolved nations an equal say in institutions that affect everyone's lives, such as the Bank of England.UKIP: Increase the personal allowance to the level of full-time minimum wage earnings, about £13,500, by 2020. Abolish inheritance tax. Introduce a 35% income tax rate between £42,285 and £55,000, at which point the 40% rate becomes payable. Set up a Treasury Commission to design a turnover tax on large businesses. Cut foreign aid budget by £9bn a year. Scrap HS2. Save £8bn a year in membership fees by leaving the EU.  Lower the VAT rate charged on restorations to listed buildings.Greens: People earning more than £100,000 a year would pay 50% income tax. Wealth tax of 1% to 2% on people worth £3m or more. Renationalise the railways and energy companies. Scrap HS2. Allow councils to impose extra business rates on out-of-town supermarkets to fund small local businesses. Crackdown on tax avoidance by multinationals. Allow ""the current dependence on economic growth to cease, and allow zero or negative growth to be feasible without individual hardship"". Commit Britain to a ""zero carbon"" future. Cut rail and bus fares by an average of 10%. Enforce a cap on bankers' bonuses.The NHSConservatives:  Chancellor George Osborne says he will put an extra £2bn into frontline health services across the UK, which he described as a ""down payment"" on a plan drawn up by NHS bosses calling for an extra £8bn a year above inflation by 2020. In England, everyone would be able to see a GP seven days a week by 2020. Recruit 5,000 more doctors.Labour:  Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said Labour would commit an extra £2.5bn a year above Mr Osborne's plan. The money will come from three sources - a new ""mansion"" tax, clamping down on tax avoidance by big corporations and a new tax on tobacco companies. Patients in England would get a GP appointment within 48 hours and would not have to wait longer than a week for cancer tests and results. Scrap the Health and Social Care Act and end ""creeping privatisation"" of the NHS.  Integrate health and social care services into a system of ""whole-person care"". Give greater priority to mental health services. Replace the Cancer Drugs Fund in England when it runs out in 2016 with a £330m fund to improve access to innovative cancer drugs, surgery and radiotherapy. Recruit 5,000 more healthcare workers to help patients stay in their homes and introduce new safety checks to identify people at risk of hospitalisation. Prioritise child mental health by increasing the proportion of the mental health budget spent on children.Lib Dems: An extra £1bn for the NHS every year, to be funded by - amongst other things - making higher earners pay more tax on their shares. Half of this will go towards mental health. Ensure that spending on the NHS rises in line with growth in the economy. People who need therapy for conditions such as depression will be guaranteed treatment within 18 weeks. For young patients experiencing psychosis for the first time treatment will be provided within two weeks of being referred by a GP. This is all going to happen from April, with more mental health targets to follow if the Lib Dems return to government. Wants a cross-party review of the future of NHS funding.SNP: Reduce the number of senior managers in the NHS by 25% over the next parliament. Streamline the work of health boards. Real terms increases in year-on-year NHS spending.Plaid Cymru: Recruit 1,000 extra doctors to the Welsh NHS over two terms of a Plaid government. Offer financial incentives for recruiting doctors to areas and specialisms where there are, or are predicted to be, shortages. Encourage innovation and attract more research funding, in part by increasing research and development funding as government finance allows. Improve training for postgraduate doctors and stop them being used to ""plug gaps"" in staff rotas. More recruitment from within the EU to fill vacancies and using international doctors to staff the NHS while a new generation of Welsh doctors are trained.UKIP: An extra £3bn per year in NHS funding paid for by quitting the EU and through ""middle management"" cuts. Keep NHS free at the point of delivery. Stop any further use of PFI, and encourage local authorities to buy out their PFI contracts early where it is affordable to do so. Ensure all visitors and migrants who have been here for fewer than five years have NHS-approved medical insurance as a condition of entry to UK, with £200m of the £2bn saved to be spent on ending hospital parking charges in England. Bring back state-enrolled nurses and return powers to matrons. Monitor and Care Quality Commission to be replaced with elected county health boards. Stop spending £90m a year on gastric band and breast enhancement operations.Greens: Funding to be diverted away from centralised facilities towards community healthcare, illness prevention and health promotion.  Stop privatisation. Abolish prescription charges. Dedicated NHS Tax to go direct to the health service. Ban proactive recruitment of non-British NHS staff from overseas. A complete ban on the promotion of tobacco and alcohol products, including sponsorship.Security, defence and foreign affairsConservatives: Hold a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU by 2017, after negotiating the return of some powers from Brussels. Protect foreign aid budget. Replace Trident.Labour:  Push for reform of European Union and prevent Britain from ""sleepwalking"" towards exit. Commit in law to holding a Strategic Defence and Security Review every 5 years. Outlaw discrimination and abuse of Armed Forces personnel.Lib Dems: Campaign to reduce the number of Trident nuclear submarines. Push for greater European Union efficiency. SNP: Oppose nuclear weapons and push for removal of Trident submarines from Scotland. In 2010, proposed a Scottish Centre for Reconciliation and Conflict Resolution, to promote peaceful alternatives to armed conflict. Maintain 0.7% commitment to foreign aid. Enhanced role for Scotland within the UK in Europe, particularly in fisheries policy.Plaid Cymru: Honour commitment of 0.7% of budget used for foreign aid. Campaign for cancellation of developing countries' debts. Support the Fair Trade movement. Support the 'Tobin' or 'Robin hood' tax as a means of encouraging more responsibility and stability in the global markets. Reform the IMF and World Bank in order to improve regulation and accountability. Continue membership of the EU, but campaign for democratic reform. Support minority nations and minority language speakers around the world. Pass a Military Wellbeing Act to promote and safeguard the physical and mental health and wellbeing of military personnel.UKIP:  Leave the European Union. Remove the passports of any person who has gone to fight for a terrorist organisation and deport anyone who has committed a terrorist act. Cut foreign aid budget by £9bn. Create a Veterans Department to look after the interests of ex-service men and women.Greens: Referendum on Britain's EU membership. Want reform of EU to hand powers back to local communities. Boost overseas aid to 1% of GDP within 10 years. Scrap Britain's nuclear weapons. Take the UK out of NATO unilaterally. End the so-called ""special relationship"" between the UK and the US.  Stop EU-US free trade deal TTIP. JobsConservatives: Create three million apprenticeships to be paid for by benefit cuts.Labour: Guarantee a job for under 25s unemployed for over a year and adults unemployed for more than two years. As many young people to go on an apprenticeship as currently go to university by 2025. Create a million new high technology, green jobs by 2025. Ban ""exploitative"" zero hour contracts.Lib Dems: An extra £1 an hour for the lowest paid apprentices. Campaign to create a million more jobs.SNP: Introduce gender quotas on public boards. Living wage ""a central priority"" in all Scottish government contracts. Continue the 'small business bonus'.Plaid Cymru: Provide rates relief for small businesses. Increase the number and value of contracts from Welsh public bodies that go to firms within Wales.UKIP: Allow firms to offer jobs to British workers first ""without the fear of being sued for discrimination"".Greens: A national energy conservation scheme to create thousands of new jobs. The party wants to create ""sustainable jobs"" and promotes more local production of food and goods.Education Conservatives: Protect England's schools budget - from reception entry at age four or five to the end of GCSEs at 16 - in cash terms although funding per pupil will not keep pace with inflation. Pre-school and post 16 education not ring fenced. Convert up to 3,500 more schools judged by Ofsted to ""require improvement"" into academies. ""War on illiteracy and innumeracy"". State primary schools in England that repeatedly failed to have a proportion of year-six pupil pass times tables and writing tests be forced to become academies, or have sponsorship replaced if already an academy. Opposed to giving votes to 16 and 17-year-olds for UK-wide general elections and local elections in England.Labour:  Increase the overall education budget in England, including schools, nurseries, Sure Start and provision for 16-to 18-year-olds, by at least the rate of inflation, although per-pupil funding is not specifically protected, meaning some of the increase will be eaten up by rising pupil numbers. Parents of primary school children would be guaranteed childcare from 8am to 6pm. The amount of free childcare for three and four year olds would be increased from 15 to 25 hours a week. Compulsory sex and relationship education in all schools. Refuse to grant business rate relief to independent schools unless they can show a ""meaningful impact"" on state schools through a new School Partnership Standard, for example by lending teaching staff or assisting in university admissions procedures. Committed to extending the franchise to 16 and 17-year-olds in elections across the UK. Double the number of Sure Start childcare places to more than 118,000. Tighten up the rules on primary school class sizes to ensure they do not have more than 30 pupils.Lib Dems: Protect the education budget from cuts. Guarantee qualified teachers and a core curriculum set by independent experts, as well as compulsory sex education, in all state schools including academies and free schools. More money for disadvantaged school children and free childcare for all two year olds. A two-thirds discount on all local bus fares for young people aged 16-21. Supports lowering the voting age to 16 in all UK elections.SNP: Guaranteed free 30 hours of childcare a week for three and four-year-olds in Scotland, up from 16 hours. Maintain lack of tuition fees at Scottish universities, and offer financial support in grants and loans to students. Continue to build and refurbish schools. Lower voting age to 16 in all UK elections.Plaid Cymru: Introduce a compulsory modern foreign language GCSE in secondary schools and the teaching of modern foreign languages in primary schools. Look at ways to strengthen the teaching of Welsh history and culture. Oppose foundation schools, academies and free schools. Look at moving from a per-pupil funding mechanism to a funding model based on the catchment area. Will not support any further increases in tuition fees for higher education students, and will seek the abolition of tuition fees as and when public finances allow. Supports lowering the voting age to 16 for elections to the Welsh Assembly and the UK Parliament.UKIP: More grammar schools. Scrap sex education for children aged under seven. Scrap tuition fees for students from poorer backgrounds who take degree courses in the sciences, technology, maths or engineering. Greater emphasis on vocational education with new Apprenticeship Qualification Option. School governing boards must be made up of at least 30% parents of children at the school. Allow universities to charge same amount for EU students as non-EU students.Greens: End performance related pay for teachers. Replace Ofsted with an independent National Council for Educational Excellence. Bring Free Schools and Academies into local authority control.

Withdraw Jobseeker's Allowance from young people after six months unless they take part in ""community projects"". And 18 to 21-year-olds wouldn't be entitled to housing benefit. Ban on zero-hours contracts which stop people getting work elsewhere. Raise the personal allowance - the point at which you start paying income tax - to £11,000 in April 2016 and then to £12,500 by 2020, which means that if you work on minimum wage for 30 hours you will pay no income tax. Young people out of work, education or training for six months will have to do unpaid community work to get benefits. This will apply to about 50,000 18 to 21-year-olds. Universal benefits for pensioners, such as free bus passes, TV licences for the over 75s and the winter fuel allowance. will once again be protected. Labour: Freeze energy prices until 2017. Increase in the minimum wage from £6.50-an-hour to £8-an-hour by 2020. Rises in child benefit capped at 1% for the first two years of the next parliament. Winter fuel allowance would be withdrawn from the wealthiest pensioners. Repeal what the government calls the spare room subsidy, dubbed the ""bedroom tax"" by Labour.  A million interest-free loans to help people insulate their homes. Rail fares would be capped. Double the amount of paid paternity leave available to new fathers from two to four weeks, and increase statutory paternity pay to £260 a week.Lib Dems: Raise the personal allowance - the point at which you start paying income tax - to £11,000 in April 2016 and then to £12,500 by 2020 (the Conservatives are promising the same thing). Nick Clegg has said he would not accept Conservative plans to freeze working-age benefits without taxing the rich too. He hasn't said he would block welfare cuts altogether. Withdraw eligibility for the Winter Fuel Payment and free TV Licence from pensioners on the 40% rate of income tax. A ""yellow card"" system to deal with benefit claimants breaking the rules, rather than imposing sanctions without warning.SNP: Oppose cuts to in-work benefits. Support moves to extend paternity leave. Introduce a maximum combined withdrawal rate for benefits and reforms to employment support allowance and cold weather payments. Protect policies such as concessionary travel for older Scots.Plaid Cymru: Move away from complex and expensive means testing for child-related benefits. Continue to campaign for the introduction of a living pension during the period of the next parliament for those aged 80 and over. UKIP: Only pay child benefit for the first two children for new claimants. Increase the Carers' Allowance to the same level as Jobseekers' Allowance (JSA) and pay a higher rate of JSA if you've been in work and already made tax and National Insurance contributions. Prevent anyone taking up permanent residence in Britain unless they're able to support themselves and any dependents they bring with them for at least five years and stop them receiving benefits. Stop paying child benefit for children who don't live in Britain. Scrap what UKIP calls the ""detested bedroom tax"". Boost ""credit unions"".Greens: The party backs a Citizen's Income, a fixed amount of £72 income a week to be paid to every individual, whether they are in work or not, to be funded by higher taxes on the better off and green levies.  But in the short-term it would increase the minimum wage to £10 by 2020. Ban zero hours contracts. Axe the ""bedroom tax"". Abolish the work capability assessment and restore the level of the former disability living allowance. Scrap the government's welfare cap, which limits the maximum amount a household can claim annually to £26,000 a year."

2015-04-16,Elephant trap?,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32047998,"The campaign has not even got under way, yet in the space of a couple of hours we have now been treated to not only one election pledge, but to two. The prime minister ruled out raising VAT if re-elected - while Labour said National Insurance contributions wouldn't go up.Usually politicians fudge the question of tax rises.  When he was leader of the opposition David Cameron himself said ""we have no need to raise taxes"" - before hiking up VAT after polling day.Famously, John Major said he had ""no plans"" to put up the sales tax -  before his chancellor did just that.And when he appeared in front of the cross-party Treasury committee of MPs on Tuesday, the current chancellor seemed to be continuing that tradition.  Under repeated questioning, George Osborne said: ""The policies we have do not involve a VAT rise.""That formulation appeared to give him not so much wriggle room, but an entire wriggle mansion.Labour assumed their campaign warning of further VAT rises to come under the Tories was very much on the money.But George Osborne's allies are suggesting privately that he had, in fact, been walking Ed Miliband to the edge of an elephant trap, then beckoning the prime minister to push the opposition leader in.Ed Miliband's strategists fully expected Mr Cameron to repeat the chancellor's obfuscation on tax at the final Prime Minister's Questions of this Parliament. They would then have expanded on the theme, inviting the prime minister to answer other difficult questions - then say he wasn't being straight with the British people for avoiding them.But the Labour leader was completely wrong-footed when first the prime minister said he would rule out a VAT rise and then counter-punched, inquiring if Labour would now rule out an increase in National Insurance contributions.Ed Miliband dodged the question and what could have been downbeat Conservative benches, uneasy over the prime minister's announcement this week of his retirement plans, were given something to cheer.The reason Ed Miliband didn't respond is because he was holding the National Insurance pledge back for Labour's manifesto.But that soon became unsustainable - so the other Ed, the shadow chancellor Ed Balls, had to undertake a hasty round of the TV studios to do just that.When I spoke to him mid-tour, he put on a brave face. His view was that George Osborne, having raised VAT from 17.5% to 20%, wanted to give the issue a low profile - whereas the prime minister had now made the mistake of putting it centre stage. And he believed David Cameron's promise would be judged against his past VAT-raising performance.He defended Ed Miliband's reluctance to talk about National Insurance as he felt it would have been ""inappropriate"" to announce Labour tax policy at PMQs.So the prime minister - always a better tactician than strategist - can at least satisfy himself that he smoked Labour out on NI and disrupted at least one entry in their election campaign grid.But the exchange actually raised more questions than it answered.If the main parties are ruling out further potential sources of revenue, but still committing themselves to eradicating a £90bn black hole in the public finances, will they now be under more pressure during the election campaign to spell out in much greater detail exactly what they intend to cut?"
2015-04-16,Who's next?,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32031343,"David Cameron's declaration that he will not seek a third term in office if he retains power in May has immediately stoked interest in who might fill his shoes when he's gone. Here are the likely - and perhaps less obvious - possibilities.Claim? As chancellor of the exchequer he's the man in charge of the purse strings and master strategist - and reportedly the PM's favourite to succeed him, although he hasn't said as much. Mr Cameron's right-hand man has had an image makeover of late, with a new haircut and a diet to shed some pounds. And he has seemingly recovered from his ""omnishambles"" Budget in 2012, with his latest - and last Budget - of the parliament giving the Tories a lead in some polls. He's said to be well liked among Conservative cabinet ministers and backbench MPs, whose support is vital for any candidate wanting to take on the party leadership. He shas some work to do among grassroots Tory members, however, coming fifth in ConservativeHome's latest online poll of party members on future leaders.Latest odds: 10/1 (according to William Hill)What's he said? ""The prime minister leads a strong team but what you see from him is answering a direct question with a direct answer. I think that's really refreshing. He says he's going to serve that full five years so the real question facing the country now is do you want the strong leadership of David Cameron that's delivering zero inflation and record jobs or do you want the chaos and incompetence of Ed Miliband.""Claim? The longest-serving home secretary in 50 years, she is only the second Conservative woman to secure one of the top four jobs in government. In her role, she has talked tough on immigration and crime and taken on the Police Federation. And she is popular with Tory activists, consistently occupying either first or second place in ConservativeHome's online polls on future party leaders. There have long been claims of Mrs May positioning herself for the top job, with reported tensions between her and the prime minister. Critics say she lacks charisma and micro-manages - while some cannot forget her coining the now infamous ""nasty party"" phrase at a Tory conference in 2002, but supporters say she is a formidable operator, and have dubbed her Britain's Angela Merkel. Latest odds: 9/2What's she said? ""My view is very simple, David Cameron is a first class leader of the party and a first class prime minister and I hope he is going to be doing that for a very long time."" (Desert Island discs, 23 November 2014)Claim? The blonde bombshell and mayor of London who can seemingly reach voters that others in the party cannot. Casting aside a rather chequered past he steered the capital through the 2012 Olympics, launched the successful and popular ""Boris bikes"" and got rid of London's ""bendy buses"" in favour of the new Routemaster double deckers. Mr Johnson hopes to revive his Westminster parliamentary career at the general election. He has been tipped by many to take the helm of the Conservative Party, and has not discouraged the idea. Like Theresa May, he is also a favourite among the grassroots of the party, pipping her to the top spot in ConservativeHome's latest poll of party members on future leaders. (he's ahead by 2 points). Critics say the gaffe-prone politician is not the right man for the job, but his supporters point to his wide-spread appeal.Latest odds: 9/4What's he said? ""I think what David Cameron is saying is banal and obvious. There has already been a leader of the Conservative Party for ten years and he's done an outstanding job. What he's saying now is that he wants to serve through to 2020 and that is frankly what we need him to do... five more years is what this country needs. I'm not entirely certain I see what the story is. He was asked a straight question, are you going to serve a third term like Mrs Thatcher or Tony Blair and he said no, because he thinks that ten years on top of British politics is an incredibly long time.""Claim? A self-made millionaire and devotee of Margaret Thatcher, he is regarded as one of the Conservatives' fastest-rising stars. The Treasury minister-turned-culture secretary became the first of the 2010 intake of MPs to reach cabinet level, and the first Asian male Conservative cabinet minister. He's currently polling well among the Conservative grassroots, who voted him third most preferable leader in ConservativeHome's latest online future leader poll. David Cameron recently said he wants to see a British Asian prime minister in his lifetime.Latest odds: 12/1Claim? Currently holding one of the four great offices of state - foreign secretary - Mr Hammond's name has often cropped up whenever talk of leadership contenders has emerged. He has built up an impressive CV in government since the Conservatives came to power in 2010, being first awarded the job of transport secretary before his promotion to defence secretary where he stayed for three years. He's regarded by many commentators as being a potential candidate for the Tory right. He seems to have work to do among party activists, scoring only 4% in ConservativeHome's future leader poll.Latest odds: 12/1"
2015-04-16,Cereal number,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-magazine-monitor-31962592,"David Cameron has declared he won't seek a third term as prime minister, citing an advertising slogan for Shredded Wheat used in the UK more than 30 years ago. What's its enduring power, asks Justin Parkinson.The hotel kitchen staff are in disbelief. Someone in room 147 has ordered three Shredded Wheat. The maid transports them upstairs to find England cricketer Ian Botham waiting at a table, dressed in full whites.The maid leaves. Botham hides one of the Shredded Wheat under a napkin and winks to camera. Cue music, as the slogan ""Shredded Wheat. Bet you can't eat three"" appears.This advert and others featuring football manager Brian Clough and the actor Richard Kiel, who played Jaws in James Bond films, have not run for some time. Nestle, which owns the brand, says the last probably aired in 1984.But their message seems to have waned little. Telling the BBC he would only serve a limited time in Downing Street, David Cameron said: ""Terms are like Shredded Wheat - two are wonderful but three might just be too many.""The prime minister's reprise was unlikely to be accidental, says Thayne Forbes, joint managing director of the brand-valuation company Intangible Business. ""Everybody would empathise with the view that three Shredded Wheat would probably be too much,"" he says. ""The slogan suggests people shouldn't overdo it. It sounds modest and reasoned.""As marketing goes, it might seem counter-intuitive, as it discourages excessive consumption. But it also sounds honest and unexploitative.Other advertising slogans and themes are in wide use in public and political discourse. Examples include Marmite being a by-word for divisiveness - a ""Marmite person"" is either loved or hated. Cameron has twice referred to Ronseal - the woodcare product that does ""exactly what it says on the tin"". But Shredded Wheat, its best-known slogan having lain dormant for so long, appears to be used less often. The cereal, created in the US in the 1890s, has long been sold as good for the evolving British lifestyle. A newspaper advert in 1902 described it as ""a relief from the monotony of everlasting porridge"", while, by 1943, it was ""an ideal food for all war workers"". The 1980s saw an emphasis on ""simple, honest goodness"", while, in the 2000s, its long heritage and reliability was promoted.""It's a good association for Cameron,"" says Forbes. ""He must have been brought up on it, like lots of other people. It will be great marketing for Shredded Wheat to have the slogan used after so many years, too.""Subscribe to the BBC News Magazine's email newsletter to get articles sent to your inbox"
2015-04-16,Are you 'cosmopolitan'?,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32021853,"The rise of UKIP heralds the emergence of a new divide in British politics, with cosmopolitan voters on one side and non-cosmopolitan ones on the other, argues Jeremy Cliffe.We hear a lot about UKIP these days. The party stole the show at the local and European elections last year, then again in the autumn when it lured two Conservative MPs to defect.  In the past weeks alone there have been three much-discussed television programmes about the party: ""Meet the Ukippers"", ""Farage Fans and UKIP Lovers"" and ""100 Days of UKIP"". At the upcoming general election the party will probably increase its share of seats in Westminster - and will certainly affect the results in dozens of other constituencies by taking votes from the other parties. But ask some of those academics who have been watching UKIP's rise, and they will tell you that it is just one part of a bigger story. We are all used to the left-right divide in politics: a spectrum of different views on how much the government should tax, spend, regulate and otherwise intervene in the economy. But according to Dr Rob Ford of Manchester University, UKIP exists on a different axis, one to do with cultural rather than economic matters. This new political scale is ever more prominent in British political life.Radio 4's Analysis programmeOn the one end of it is what you might call a ""cosmopolitan"" philosophy: a relaxed, liberal attitude to issues concerning national identity (like immigration) and to questions of morality and lifestyle (like gay marriage). On the other end is a ""non-cosmopolitan"" outlook: more nationalist, socially conservative and less comfortable with social change, or in other words the ideological stance often associated with typical UKIP voters. This divide cuts across the left-right scale: there are cosmopolitan and non-cosmopolitan voters in both the Conservative and the Labour camps, which is why UKIP takes support from both.Lots of things are making this cosmopolitanism divide more important. One is that the old class-based, ideological conflict between left and right has declined. Dr James Tilley of Oxford University argues that politicians are partly to blame. The economic philosophies of the Conservative and Labour parties are so similar, he argues, that other, cultural issues are becoming more important. Another factor is the growing gap between the generations: the difference in outlook between the cosmopolitan young and less cosmopolitan, older voters is greater than it was in the past (partly due to the recent rise in levels of university education, which tend to correlate with liberal views). This trend presents the established parties with some difficult questions. As Dr Ford puts it, they ""have to try and deal with this rising value divide, particularly now that UKIP has mobilised it into the political debate."" ""They have to make a move,"" he adds, ""but any move that they make risks making their position worse with one or the other of these groups of voters."" Sound too cosmopolitan, and the parties risk losing supporters to UKIP. Try to ""out-UKIP UKIP"", and they could alienate their younger, more socially liberal supporters. So both are doing the political splits, trying to reconcile the cosmopolitans within their ranks with the non-cosmopolitans. Witness the tortuous attempts by Ed Miliband to sound tough on immigration without sounding too tough. Witness, too, the recent struggles of David Cameron to persuade social conservatives in his party that gay marriage can be an innately conservative institution. In the long-term, this divide will become less problematic. That is because over the years the country will tilt towards the cosmopolitan end of this new spectrum. So says Penny Young of NatCen, the research organisation that conducts the extensive British Social Attitudes survey. Various demographic factors explain this trend. The country as a whole is becoming more accepting of same-sex relationships. Younger voters are more relaxed about things like immigration and national identity than were previous generations when they were young, suggesting that the overall population will tilt in an internationalist direction over time. And ever more parts of the country are acquiring the ethnic and social diversity once confined to the inner cities, a trend that generally makes people more comfortable with immigration. According to Dr Ford the question is therefore: how should the main political parties navigate this period of transition? It would be wrong to simply abandon the swathes of voters at the less cosmopolitan end of the scale; voters who are usually older and more isolated than the average member of the population.Yet the politicians do need to adapt to the changing attitudes of British society and be honest with voters rather than pandering to views that, deep down, they do not share. This quandary may not decide the upcoming general election, but in the established parties savvy strategists with an eye to elections in 2020 and beyond are grappling with it nonetheless. That is a wise move."
2015-04-16,Dudley debate,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32015334,"I met Afzal Amin for the first time on Friday, but I already knew who he was. In Dudley North, the seat he was selected by the Conservatives to fight in the general election, Mr Amin had become hard to avoid. When I first looked at the local newspaper online, the pages were surrounded by ""Amin"" logos in the preferred Tory shade of blue.Not long after we met, he asked me to pose for a photo, snapped by one of his campaign team, and doubtless rapidly tweeted out to followers of the would-be MP.Perhaps no surprise that the man running such a disciplined operation has served in the army and been to Sandhurst. That was very much the message he delivered on Friday, as he addressed school and college pupils at a hustings in Dudley which I'd been invited to chair.There was combative debate, too, not least with his Labour rival, the MP Ian Austin. Both men knew the Dudley contest was critical for their respective parties; Ian Austin held the seat by just over 600 votes in 2010. Just as David Cameron was denied a majority by failing to take seats like this one, so Ed Miliband is unlikely to be in No 10 if Labour loses Dudley North.He was self-confident and fluent. The only obvious mis-step came right at the end, when he interrupted Vicky Duckworth, the Green candidate for the neighbouring seat. She expressed the opinion that politics often seemed to be about men shouting at each other; Mr Amin complained she was engaging in gender bias.A few weeks ago, one Conservative MP who knows him well and respects his talents, said Afzal Amin had warned him of the risks of over-confidence. He thought he risked running before he could walk.Well, he stumbled badly this weekend. Whatever the purpose of his contacts with the English Defence League - and he strongly disputes claims that he wanted them to hold a protest that would then be called off, for which he could then take the credit - the exposure has damaged him and, potentially, the prospects of his party re-taking the seat.In February, the EDL staged a rally against plans for a new mosque in the town. As the Mail on Sunday story makes clear, Afzal Amin pleaded with them beforehand not to hold that demonstration; but it went ahead anyway. It's what happened subsequently which will feature in Tuesday's disciplinary hearing.Over the weekend, I put his defence to a very senior Conservative source - that this was an attempt to broker a compromise in order to bring together a divided community. The arch response: Dudley isn't Kandahar.Nor do I think from my visits to the town, where I'm going to be based for the general election, will people in Dudley appreciate being painted as somewhere riven by racial discord.True, Dudley was the scene of one of England's earliest race riots. But that was in 1962. Although the controversy over replacing the mosque - currently in a converted school and inadequate for the numbers who want to worship there - has been running for a decade, community relations are generally good. Even those who don't want a new mosque didn't want the EDL protestors - nor to be fair the anti-fascist counter-demonstrators who followed them.As for the Conservative Party, the view of the national leadership is that you don't collaborate with the EDL. Not least because the Tories are still struggling to bury some historic baggage in the Black Country: Enoch Powell was an MP in Wolverhampton when he delivered his Rivers of Blood speech about immigration in 1968.Four years before that, there was the notorious election in Smethwick which the Conservatives were accused of winning by wooing white voters with an offensive rhyme suggesting who'd they'd get as a neighbour if they voted Labour. Afzal Amin grew up in Smethwick so he should be aware of that history. He was, until his suspension on Saturday, one of about 17% of Conservative parliamentary candidates who are not white. The party is proud of that, but it's still struggling to translate that into votes.Afzal Amin may believe that he can persuade the party to lift the suspension when he meets party officials on Tuesday. I have my doubts. Even if they accept his defence, will the other parties be so charitable? The allegations would follow him on the campaign trail, and make planned visits by cabinet ministers next to impossible.On Friday, just before the hustings in Dudley began, Afzal Amin gave me his business card. It introduces him as 'prospective member of Parliament Dudley North'. I think I'll keep it; it could yet become a collector's item."

2015-04-17,Bid to change Speaker election rules,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32061097,"A last-minute bid to change the way the Speaker of the House of Commons is elected is to be debated by MPs.Labour criticised the government motion, to be debated on the final day before the dissolution of Parliament, saying the Conservatives were ""trying to play politics with the speakership"".Under the proposals, a secret ballot would decide whether there should be a contested election for the post.MPs currently have to file through the division lobbies to cast their vote.This means it is clear who does or does not back the incumbent as Speaker.Labour's shadow leader of the Commons Angela Eagle raised the party's concerns in the House on Wednesday evening, questioning whether the motion was within parliamentary rules.Current Speaker John Bercow is - technically - one of them, but many Tory MPs have never liked him.They resent his personal style and some believe he is far from impartial in the way he conducts business in the Commons.Attempts by some to force a vote on his resumption as Speaker in 2010 came to nothing. There have been the occasional measured jibes at him from the prime minister. Other Tories reportedly went much further and formed a group whose members had all been reprimanded by him. But the Speaker is a reformer who believes passionately that the people who elect the members, and pay the bills, should come first.The last act of the coalition looks like being an attempt to unseat him. And they are very serious about it.One Tory MP fighting an important marginal seat had been cleared by his party to be away from Parliament but he is now staying for the vote, such is the importance of it.She told Deputy Speaker Lindsay Hoyle: ""It's just come to my attention that the government has tabled a motion for debate on the final day of this Parliament, with no notice whatsoever to myself as shadow leader of the House, proposing changes to the way in which the Speaker of this House is elected.""Procedural matters in this House, with no consultation with the opposition, no consultation with the chair of the committee itself, for debate in only one hour tomorrow.""Mr Hoyle said the motion had been ""rightly or wrongly"" agreed to on Tuesday, saying that ""business of the House is decided by the government, not by the chair.""A spokesman for Commons Leader William Hague said the motion had been tabled as a free hour had opened up in Thursday's business after the House of Lords approved the Modern Slavery Bill.The proposed change would apply when a Speaker wishes to continue in the post after a general election.Under the current rules, if the Speaker's re-appointment is objected to, a division is held, with MPs choosing to back or oppose the Speaker in the division lobbies.The replacement of this method with a secret ballot was suggested in 2010 by a committee of MPs, which said the public method ""can be seen as a deterrent to the House expressing its views honestly"".MPs will now debate whether this change should be made."

2015-04-17,MPs warn on growth of UK jihadists,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32059813,"Not enough is being done to prevent people leaving the UK to join Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, a group of MPs has warned.Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said Britain must win their ""hearts and minds"".The committee's report comes as the BBC launches a database tracking British jihadists in Syria and Iraq. It shows that many people left in clusters from certain UK areas - often due to friendships and peer groups. The MPs' report argued that preventative work with communities, families and international partners was ""vital"" and needs to be a top priority for the Home Office.  ""The number of cases being brought to public attention should ring alarm bells,"" said Labour MP Mr Vaz.  ""This must be a relentless battle for hearts and minds, and without a strong counter-narrative we are in danger of failing to prevent even more departures. We are at the edge of a cliff."" The BBC has been tracking the stories of the men, women, boys and girls who have gone to Syria and Iraq to understand why they go, where they go from and what happens to them. By analysing around 160 profiles, it reveals the way in which people have travelled in clusters - a group of three young friends from Coventry, another group from Portsmouth, drawn out by one person they knew, others in Cardiff linked to people involved in an extremist organisation. Social media might play a part but face-to-face contact appears just as, if not more, important, according to the database.It includes the stories of: The BBC research emphasises the extent to which real-world contacts, rather than just online connections, are often a key driver of radicalisation and intent to travel to Iraq and Syria. Some of the experts who appeared before the Home Affairs Committee also argued the internet was a secondary influence. They said that universities and prisons were among the two most significant places where radicalisation occurred. A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police, which was not aware of the report, said it would have ""welcomed the opportunity"" to have given evidence to the committee and that it planned to look at the report in detail.The disappearance of schoolgirls Shamima Begum, Amira Abase, both 15, and Kadiza Sultana, 16, from east London in February, raised questions as to who could have done more to prevent their departure. After taking evidence from the police and the families of the girls among others, Mr Vaz said their case suffered from a ""lack of immediate action"". He added: ""Schools and the police must inform parents immediately, and work with them even if there is the smallest hint of radicalisation, or a close association with someone who is thought to have been radicalised.""However, the Met Police spokesman defended the speed of the police response to the schoolgirls' disappearance.  He said the committee's criticism was ""misleading"", pointing to the evidence given by both UK and Turkish authorities of ""rapid exchanges"" between the two.The committee's report said there needed to be an advice service which would be a less extreme step than calling the anti-terrorist hotline.The Association of Chief Police Officer's lead officer for the government's anti-terror strategy Prevent, Chief Constable Sir Peter Fahy, agreed that more needed to be done.However, he said the police ""do not have the capacity"" to routinely work with every school in the country.He added: ""The police service will play its part but the prime responsibility for dissuading young people from getting involved in extremist activity has to lie with parents, families and carers.""The committee also pointed to weaknesses in information sharing with airlines and other countries. It said greater care needed to be taken at airport check-in desks when people were travelling to destinations of concern - namely Syria, Somalia, Iraq and Nigeria, as well as neighbouring countries, such as Turkey. The report said police also needed to work faster to alert overseas partners and airlines when there were concerns over individuals.There were signs that some of the girls had followed extremist accounts on social media, the report said.The committee said that social media companies, such as Facebook and Twitter, should be prepared to suspend accounts when there is evidence they are being used to promote violent extremism.  The report also said it was disappointed the Home Office had not implemented a programme for individuals returning to Britain where there is evidence they had fought in Syria.Security officials estimate that some 600 Britons have left the country to join IS - and while around half may have returned, many are still out there - and some have died.  The BBC project includes detailed profiles of individuals which can be searched, based on hometown, age and gender, as well as those who have been convicted in the courts or who are believed to have been killed."

If not, the prince's private letters will either remain confidential, as the sender intended, or they'll be exposed to a large and inquisitive audience.

That will be a clear pledge from us.""He accused Mr Cameron of making an ""out of the blue, panicky"" announcement on VAT that ""no one in Britain will believe"".Labour, which has already announced plans to increase the top rate of income tax and impose a new ""mansion tax"" on high value properties, insists its plans are fully costed and will not require additional tax hikes if it wins May's general election.Mr Miliband began his final head-to-head encounter with Mr Cameron before the election by joking that the PM had ""announced his retirement plans"" - a reference to a BBC interview in which the prime minister said he would not serve a third term if the Tories remained in power.Challenging Mr Cameron to give a ""straight answer to a straight question"", Mr Miliband pressed him on whether he would rule out a rise in VAT after the election, as Labour had done.In response, the prime minister immediately said ""yes"", prompting loud cheers in turn from the Conservative benches. He contrasted what he said was a ""clear promise"" with Labour's unwillingness to rule out a rise in National Insurance.""I answered a very simple question about VAT. I ruled out an increase... straight answer to him, straight question from me. I have ruled out VAT. Will he rule out national insurance contributions. Yes or no?"" Mr Cameron added: ""We all know this is Labour's job tax. This is their tax of choice. This is what they clobber working people, families and enterprises with.""But Mr Miliband responded by saying there was ""only one person who is going to raise taxes on working families and that is him"".He said nobody would believe Mr Cameron on VAT ""because of his extreme spending plans, because his numbers do not add up and because he promised it last time and broke his promise"".Mr Cameron, he added, had broken other promises made before the last election to reduce annual net migration below 100,000 and not to pursue a major structural re-organisation of the NHS, adding that it was ""time for a better plan and time for a Labour government"".But Mr Cameron suggested a future Labour government would result in the ""chaos of economic crisis"", with Ed Miliband being ""held hostage"" by the SNP.The packed session provided a last opportunity for the two men to rally their MPs and set out their arguments before the start of the election campaign next week.Speaking after the exchanges and the other parties' tax pledges, deputy prime minister Nick Clegg said the Lib Dems ""don't need to raise VAT, national insurance or headline rates of income tax or corporation tax either"".""There are other taxes and other tax loopholes that we can increase or close in order to balance the books,"" he said.

2015-04-17,Met police 'had files on MPs in 90s',https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32044580,"A former undercover police officer has told BBC News that Scotland Yard kept intelligence files on MPs during the 1990s. Ex-Special Branch officer Peter Francis says he saw files on 10 Labour MPs which he and others regularly updated. He says he personally gathered information on three MPs as part of his work infiltrating left-wing groups. The MPs named, and Labour, have called for a forthcoming public inquiry into undercover policing to be widened. Mr Francis operated undercover between 1993 and 1997 in the Met's now disbanded Special Demonstration Squad. He was told to embed himself in left-wing groups or causes that were deemed to pose a potential threat to security. He says that during this period he was told to gather intelligence on MPs and their activities if and when they featured in any of his operations. That information, he says, was added to a special pink file that was available for Special Branch officers to read. Between 1990 and 2001, he claims to have personally seen records relating to Diane Abbott, the late Tony Benn, Jeremy Corbyn, the late Bernie Grant, Peter Hain, Harriet Harman, Ken Livingstone, Joan Ruddock, Dennis Skinner and Jack Straw.Four of the group became ministers during Mr Francis's time in Special Branch - including Jack Straw who was home secretary after 1997. ""When I was deployed undercover in the Special Demonstration Squad, any MP that I came across, such as on demonstrations, I would report back on them,"" he said. Mr Francis says that the files not only contained the MPs' publicly-stated political views - but also intelligence on what was going on behind the scenes in the party or their group. He says some of the information would have been things said in private by the MP, depending on how close each undercover officer had been able to get. Mr Francis said that when he first saw the files he understood that each had probably been created before the individual was an MP because of their personal involvement in radical causes or protests.But he added: ""When they became MPs these files carried on. It [was] your duty as an SDS officer to report back any intelligence that you come across. ""I felt that it was OK to report back on MPs,"" he said. ""I used to give myself a pat on the back, thinking 'I have done a good job'. These MPs were spied on and they should know.""""I don't think the police force should be monitoring MPs, full stop. I don't think we have any right to do that at all. It may be justifiable to say that the Security Service should be doing it - but I certainly don't think the police should be doing it.""Scotland Yard has refused to comment on the substance of the claims, but a spokesman said it had not shied away from serious allegations about the SDS. It said that Operation Herne, the internal police investigation into what happened in the unit, remained an ongoing investigation.""Operation Herne maintains that without speaking to Peter Francis it is simply not possible to fully investigate allegations he makes,"" said a spokesman. ""Operation Herne remains very willing to engage with him.""Mr Francis said that he has refused to speak to Operation Herne because he fears being interviewed under caution as a suspect, rather than a whistleblower. Scotland Yard told the BBC that Operation Herne detectives would be prepared to speak to him as a witness. He has, however, spoken to Mark Ellison QC who reviewed allegations about the SDS for the Home Secretary Theresa May - prompting her to launch a statutory inquiry. He says he will appear before those hearings. Peter Hain, who was a leader of the anti-apartheid movement in the late 1960s and 70s and became an MP in 1991, said he now wants full answers from Scotland Yard. ""I was deeply disturbed to find that files were still being kept by the Special Branch while I and others were serving Members of Parliament,"" he said. ""That is constitutionally an outrage. It infringes the sovereignty of Parliament. ""I want to see the home secretary widen the scope of the inquiry into the SDS to look specifically at the surveillance of MPs and the fact that there were active files on us while we were serving Members of Parliament. ""This should never have happened and it should have been reported and properly authorised - and we don't know whether it was.""Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper echoed the call for the inquiry to be widened in light of what she described as ""extremely serious and disturbing allegations"".""While undercover policing remains a crucial tool in combating serious and organised crime it must not be abused,"" she said.""There have now been a series of serious allegations about undercover policing - ranging from the treatment of Stephen Lawrence's family to police having long-term inappropriate relationships. ""We called some time ago for much stronger oversight of undercover policing and it is also vital to get to the truth about what has happened."" Mrs May announced earlier this month that Lord Justice Pitchford would lead the inquiry into the SDS allegations - but the precise shape of that inquiry is not yet clear.A Home Office spokesman said the review by Mark Ellison QC had unearthed ""serious historical failings"". ""That is why the Home Secretary established a public inquiry to thoroughly investigate undercover policing and the operation of the Special Demonstration Squad. ""Lord Justice Pitchford will consult interested parties to the inquiry over the coming months on setting the terms of reference, with a view to publishing these at the end of July.""Undercover policing is an essential tactic in the fight against crime but to improve the public's confidence in undercover work we must ensure there is no repeat of these failings in the future."""
2015-04-17,NHS problems worst 'since 1990s',https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/health-32057948,"Services in the NHS in England are deteriorating in a way not seen since the early 1990s, according to a leading health think tank. The King's Fund review said waiting times for A&E, cancer care and routine operations had all started getting worse, while deficits were growing.It said such drops in performance had not been seen for 20 years.But the think tank acknowledged the NHS had done as well as could be expected, given the financial climate.Professor John Appleby, chief economist at the King's Fund, which specialises in health care policy, said: ""The next government will inherit a health service that has run out of money and is operating at the very edge of its limits. ""There is now a real risk that patient care will deteriorate as service and financial pressures become overwhelming.""He said in terms of how standards were slipping - not how low they had reached - the situation was the worst it had been since the ""early 1990s"".The report noted much of the deterioration has happened in the second-half of the Parliament with many measures of performance being maintained in the first few years.It said the next government had to address the funding situation, adding the extra £8bn a year NHS England says is needed by 2020, was the ""minimum"" that would be required.The report - a review of performance this Parliament - highlights a range of problems as well as achievements. These include:The report is the second part of the King's Fund pre-election review of the NHS this Parliament.Last month it warned the coalition government's reforms of the health service had been ""damaging and distracting"".The King's Fund report should make worrying reading. The reference to the 1990s conjures up images of - for the NHS at least - a bygone era. The think tank's point was not that waiting times had reached the level they were at then, rather that this is the first time in two decades of almost continuous improvement that there has been a sustained drop in performance.In many ways, that had to happen. Services cannot keep getting better for ever. Nonetheless, the findings are crystal clear: the NHS is at a critical juncture. But what is less easy to determine is to what extent the coalition's policies have contributed to the difficulties.The think tank has already provided a critical analysis of the government's reforms - and when pushed, acknowledged the health service may have been ""in better shape"" if they had not happened.But the more significant issue for the health of the health service this Parliament has been the squeeze on finances. Even though the budget has been increased, it has felt more like a cut to many because demands have risen so quickly.On this though, the King's Fund accepted that the government's hands were tied. Given the state of the economy, ministers did as much as they could have.Read more from NickRoyal College of Nursing general secretary Peter Carter said politicians needed to take note of the warnings made by the King's Fund.""Morale is low, and more and more staff are being made sick with stress because of the intolerable pressure they are under,"" he added. Katherine Murphy, of the Patients Association, said: ""The findings echo what we are hearing on a daily basis on our helpline. It is clear to the public that the future of the NHS is one of the most important issues facing the nation and it should be a central issue in the election campaign.""Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham said: ""Five years ago David Cameron stood on a promise to protect the NHS. This report provides authoritative proof that he has broken that promise.""But a Department of Health spokesman said: ""As the King's Fund says, the NHS has 'performed well in the face of huge challenges', but if we are to continue to invest in the NHS going forward it needs to be backed by a strong economy.""

2015-04-17,SNP 'could block Tory government',https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32045419,"The SNP would block a minority Conservative government by voting down its Queen's Speech if it holds the post-election balance of power, its former leader Alex Salmond has said.Mr Salmond said the move could bring down the government if Labour joined in, with David Cameron ""locked out"".The Conservatives accused him of ""trying to sabotage the democratic will of the British people"".Labour has called his balance of power prediction ""bluster and bluff"".In recent days Mr Salmond, who is bidding to become a Westminster MP at the 7 May general election, has claimed his party could ""hold the power"" in a hung Parliament and would be able to influence the Budget of a minority Labour government.This was dismissed by Labour leader Ed Miliband, who has ruled out a formal coalition with the Scottish nationalists.The SNP currently has six MPs at Westminster, but recent opinion polls suggest its share could increase dramatically at the general election.James Cook, BBC News Scotland correspondentIf the Conservatives attempt to form a minority government and enough MPs vote against their Queen's Speech the administration would fall at the first hurdle and the leader of the opposition would have a shot at forming a government.That's how parliamentary democracy works in the event of a hung Parliament.And yet the Conservatives are saying that by planning to vote against a government he opposes Alex Salmond has ""confirmed he would sabotage the democratic will of the British people in order to make Ed Miliband prime minister"".It is part of their continuing attempt to portray Mr Miliband as a weak leader whose strings are being pulled by Mr Salmond.This kind of language causes despair among Tories north of the border who fear that the party in London is waltzing into an SNP trap.They know that many voters in Scotland will read the phrase ""democratic will of the British people"" and hear ""democratic will of the English people"".Because, if it is illegitimate for Scottish MPs, from whatever party, to vote against one government and support another in the British parliament, then what, voters may ask, is the point of the union?Who is dancing to Mr Salmond's tune now?Mr Salmond, the former Scottish first minister, told the New Statesman that in the event of a hung Parliament, a minority Conservative government would have to ""go straight effectively for a vote of confidence - usually the Queen's Speech, although it could be otherwise, of course - and we'd be voting against.""If David Cameron lost this vote, he said, there would be a two-week period for another government to be formed.BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said Mr Salmond had ""hardened his anti-Conservative rhetoric"" in the interview.A Conservative spokesman said:  ""Alex Salmond has confirmed he would sabotage the democratic will of the British people in order to make Ed Miliband prime minister. ""That would mean chaos for Britain, with weak Ed Miliband dancing to Alex Salmond's tune.""He said the ""only way to keep Britain together"" was to vote Conservative.Mr Salmond's latest comments come after Mr Miliband said the only people writing a future Labour Budget would be himself and shadow chancellor Ed Balls.Speaking in Clydebank on Monday, he added: ""It's not going to be Alex Salmond - not in a million years."""
2015-04-17,MPs criticise 'lack of EU debate',https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32045290,"The government's ""failure"" to let MPs debate EU legislation is ""deplorable"", a Parliamentary committee says.The European Scrutiny Committee said ministers had refused to schedule debates on issues such as free movement and the EU's Budget.It also said BBC coverage of EU matters should be ""improved substantially"".The government said the number of EU debates had doubled since 2009-10, while the BBC said its coverage was ""extensive and impartial"".The cross-party committee's role includes scrutinising EU documents and recommending the most important for debate in the House of Commons.Its report said in the period covering most of the 2014-15 financial year there were three debates on the floor of the House, compared with 12 in 2013-14.It also pointed out that not a single debate had taken place during a nine-month period, between 9 June 2014 and 9 March 2015.""The government's collective failure to schedule so many debates on EU documents over the past year is deplorable, and is a discourtesy to this committee and to all members of the House,"" the MPs said.Prime Minister David Cameron has sought to rally support from other EU leaders for his plans to curb welfare payments to European migrants ahead of a referendum on the UK's membership if he wins the general election.The committee said the government's ""cavalier"" approach was ""at odds with UK ministers' claims in their speeches across the EU about the role of national parliaments"".The Foreign Office said the government was committed to a ""strong EU scrutiny system that enables Parliament to hold it to account for the decisions taken in Brussels"".It added: ""We have made good on our commitment to raise standards by doubling the number of Europe debates on the floor of the House since 2009-10.""This government has also increased by around a fifth since 2010 the number of EU proposals that have been scrutinised and cleared by Parliament before being agreed in Brussels.""The committee has also been examining the BBC's coverage of European issues, taking evidence from director general Lord Hall and head of news James Harding earlier this month.During that appearance, Lord Hall said the desire for balanced output ""ran deep"" within the BBC and he believed that this was being achieved.Mr Harding said if the public was going to trust the BBC to report on politicians impartially it had to be clear that BBC journalists weren't ""asked by politicians to come and account for what they do and in effect do the bidding of those politicians"".But the committee said it was ""concerned about the manner in which the BBC treats EU issues"", calling for coverage to be ""improved substantially"".It suggested coverage did not reflect all sides of the debate on the European Union, and more analysis was needed. Its chairman, Conservative MP Sir William Cash, said the BBC had ""very particular obligations"" to be impartial and to ""educate and inform"".He added:  ""We do not believe this is currently being achieved in the context of the BBC's EU coverage.""A BBC spokesman said the corporation provided extensive and impartial coverage of European and Parliamentary issues, and it would be a breach of the corporation's independence if a committee of MPs instructed the BBC on its coverage."
2015-04-17,Lobbyists must 'conform' with rules,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32047992,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe woman in charge of the government's new register of lobbyists has said she expects the industry to ""conform"" with the statutory system. Speaking ahead of the register's launch, Alison White conceded a lot of lobbyists would not be listed on it.But she said her job was to make sure the rules were implemented and she would do so with ""extreme verve and vigour.""But one critic of the register said it was ""fake"" and full of ""loopholes"".Lobbyists are companies or individuals paid to influence government decisions.The coalition promised to introduce a statutory register of lobbyists when it came to power in 2010, and legislation was passed last year, with ministers saying the move would help clean up politics.However, the new register will only cover consultant lobbyists and will not apply to lobbyists working ""in-house"" for companies or organisations.A person or company will only need to be registered if they are contacting a government minister or permanent secretary in a government department - leading to criticism it will not come close to reflecting the scale or nature of lobbying that goes on across Whitehall.But Ms White, who is independent of the government, said her task was to implement the law as it stood not to question the powers she had been given. ""We are having something that has never been in place before,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""This is a statutory register. The industry tells me it is a professional industry. I expect them to conform with the legislation. It is my job to make sure they do so.""Ms White, who was appointed as the registrar of consultant lobbyists in September, acknowledged the register would not indicate different ""levels of lobbying"".""The legislation was quite narrowly drafted to address a particular issue, which was that it was not always particularly clear, when ministers were being lobbied, who the client of the lobbyist was. That is what the register was set up to do,"" she said.She added: ""This will give anyone who wishes to access the register the opportunity to be able to see who is lobbying and being paid for it and who their clients are. That is the main information the register will contain.""If a lobbyist sets out to influence government policy in some way, they would have to be registered. If they are not registered, then they would not be conforming. They have to go on the register before they lobby.""Ms White said last month that the register would not have any entries on its launch day but she had received more than ""20 expressions of interest"" about joining and companies and individuals might be required to sign up retrospectively.Potential registrants will be able to log on and create an account to file an ""information return"".But Tamasin Cave, from the Alliance for Lobbying Transparency coalition, said ""hardly anyone"" in the industry would be covered by the provisions of the new law. ""You have a huge commercial lobbying industry, and very few of them will have to sign up,"" she told Today.""The second flaw is that it won't show the interaction between lobbyists and government, and that is what a register is for.""It is to show the activity - who is discussing what with whom, but this shows nothing of this interaction. It is a fake register."""
2015-04-17,Car smoking ban MSP welcomes backing,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-south-scotland-32055226,"The Liberal Democrat MSP behind a bill to ban smoking in cars when children are present has welcomed the support of the Scottish government.South of Scotland MSP Jim Hume launched the members' bill in December.The government said it was ""very supportive"" of the principles of the bill, but changes could be needed to make it ""workable"".Motorists could potentially be fined £100 for breaching the rule if it becomes law.Mr Hume lodged draft proposals for a bill last May calling for a ban in Scotland on smoking in private vehicles when children under 18 were present.He said he was ""over the moon"" at the news the Scottish government would endorse the Smoking Prohibition (Children in Motor Vehicles) (Scotland) Bill.He said: ""With cross-party support and the support of many third sector organisations, there is every chance that this could be in place in the next year.""Eighty-four per cent of the 160 responses to my consultation were positive and people from across Scotland have expressed their support for the move.""The bill is about guaranteeing that children in Scotland can have the freedom to go on and lead healthy lives if they choose to.""I look forward to working with MSPs from all parties as the bill progresses.""Public Health Minister Maureen Watt said the Scottish government had considered including the measure in its Public Health Bill, but instead decided to support Mr Hume's proposals.She said: ""As with any bill, as it goes through the scrutiny process, there may be amendments and improvements to strengthen the legislation and ensure it is fit for purpose. ""But we believe that the underpinning principles are strong, and that is why I am pleased to support it.""Scottish Labour and a wide range of health organisations have backed his proposals.But the Scottish Conservatives have reservations about how the bill would work in practice.The party's health spokesman Jackson Carlaw said: ""While Scottish Conservatives support any moves which would protect young people from hazardous second hand smoke we have concerns as to how this would be enforced.""It would be a better use of resources to conduct a public awareness campaign similar to that which is being proposed by the government in Wales.""We will be watching this campaign in order to ascertain what lessons may be learned and what approaches may be adopted in Scotland.""Anti-smoking campaigners welcomed the Scottish government's backing for Mr Hume's bill.ASH Scotland's chief executive Sheila Duffy said: ""It is another public health initiative that can help Scotland move forward with its ambition to achieve a tobacco-free generation in 20 years' time.""It is popular with the public and will bring Scotland into line with upcoming legislation in England and Wales.""We believe it can be effectively enforced and that having the legislation focus on cars with children bypasses concerns over interference in people's private lives.""Jim Hume must be congratulated for taking the initiative on this proposal and for all the hard work he and his team have done to bring this important measure forward.""But Simon Clark, director of the smokers' group Forest, said the bill was ""legislation for legislation's sake"".He said: ""Smoking in cars carrying children is inconsiderate. The overwhelming majority of smokers know that and don't do it.""The very small number that do will carry on regardless because the law will be difficult, if not impossible, to enforce.""Education has to be better than legislation but the government prefers gesture politics and the big stick."""
2015-04-17,Candidate quits over UKIP MEP remark,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32038485,"A UKIP election candidate has quit the party over comments made by the party's only Scottish MEP about a Scottish government minister.Tim Wilson has decided not to stand in South Northamptonshire after David Coburn MEP compared Humza Yousaf to convicted terrorist Abu Hamza.Mr Coburn has apologised for the remarks, saying it was a ""joke"".A spokesman for UKIP said Mr Wilson had failed to emphasise local issues in his general election campaign.UKIP leader Nigel Farage said Mr Coburn's remarks were a ""joke in poor taste"" but he would not be taking any action against him.But Mr Wilson said he was disillusioned with the party over the ""racist jibes"" and has decided to stand down.He told BBC Scotland he was appalled by Mr Coburn's comments about Mr Yousaf and frustrated by the inaction of the party's leadership on the issue.  He said David Coburn had produced ""what I can only describe as an Islamaphobic insult, and that's simply not acceptable"".  Mr Wilson added: ""Of course he went on and apologised.  I think, frankly, that if you are in a position of power you have to be able to control what ideas emerge from your head and how they get to your mouth and, in fact, you shouldn't have those ideas in the first place.  ""But the real issue is that when Mr Farage was asked what he thought about this he dismissed this as a joke.  ""I don't think this is a joke. I think this is something very serious.  It may not be that this man intended to cause offence but we aren't interested in what his intentions are.  We are interested in the effect what he says has on other people and the effect is catastrophic, it's appalling and I've resigned.""In his resignation letter, Mr Wilson said he had been ""systematically gagged by the party whip"" and forbidden to speak about Islam favourably. A spokesman for UKIP said Mr Wilson had failed to put more emphasis on local issues in his campaign.He said: ""Whilst we had initially been optimistic about Tim Wilson's abilities as a candidate, it became obvious in recent weeks that he was out of his depth in representing our party in the way we would expect. ""Mr Wilson had clearly misunderstood the expectations that UKIP place on all of its candidates. Principal amongst those is focusing on issues that are relevant to local voters. UKIP put huge emphasis on local issues and Mr Wilson was unwilling to follow UKIP guidelines in this respect.""Last week MSPs at the Scottish Parliament unanimously condemned the remarks made by Mr Coburn during a newspaper interview.MSPs were debating a motion celebrating Scotland's diverse communities.The president of the European Parliament, Martin Schulz, condemned the remarks, saying they were ""not worthy of any elected member"". But a spokesman for the president said he could not act on remarks made outside parliament.The move comes just days after another candidate, Jonathan Stanley, quit in protest at the ""racist filth"" in UKIP. Mr Stanley, who was due to stand in the Cumbrian seat of Westmorland and Lonsdale, was the party's former head of policy in Scotland."

2015-04-17,Manifesto watch,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-29642613,"Political parties are putting together their manifestos for May's general election. Here's a guide to where they currently stand on the issues voters say they care about most (according to pollsters IPSOS Mori).ImmigrationConservatives:  David Cameron wants to make migrants wait four years before they can claim certain benefits, such as tax credits, Universal Credit, or get access to social housing. He wants to stop migrants from claiming child benefit for dependents living outside the UK, and remove those that have failed to find work after six months. Mr Cameron has promised to put reform of EU free movement rules at the heart of his renegotiation of Britain's relationship with the EU. He has ruled out a temporary cap on migrant numbers or an ""emergency brake"" on EU freedom of movement rules - ideas both mooted in recent months, saying this would be less ""effective"" than reducing the incentives for people to come to the UK. The party has a continuing goal to bring net immigration down to below 100,000 people a year (it currently stands at 243,000).Labour: ""Stronger"" border controls to tackle illegal immigration with ""proper"" entry and exit checks. ""Smarter"" targets to reduce low-skilled migration but ensure university students and high-skilled workers are not deterred. Employment agencies who only recruit abroad will be outlawed while the fines for employing illegal immigrants will be increased.Lib Dems: Reintroduce exit checks at borders, so the government can identify people who are overstaying their visa. Will require all new claimants for Jobseekers Allowance to have their English language skills assessed, with JSA then being conditional on attending language courses for those whose English is poor. Ensure that EU migrants have to ""earn"" their entitlement to benefits.SNP: Allow the devolved government to have control over immigration to Scotland, and introduce a Canadian-style earned citizenship system to attract highly-skilled immigrants.Plaid Cymru: Oppose a points-based system. Support the right of asylum seekers to work in Wales while they wait for status decisions to be made. Lobby the Westminster government to ensure that they shut ""detention"" centres.UKIP: Introduce an Australian-style points policy, used to select migrants with the skills and attributes needed to work in the country - covering people from inside and outside the EU. Bring net immigration down to 50,000 people a year. Priority lanes for UK passport holders. Increase UK border staff by 2,500. Tougher English language tests for migrants seeking permanent residence. Opt out of the Dublin treaty to allow the UK to return asylum seekers to other EU countries without considering their claim. Anyone who currently has the legal right to live, work, or study in the UK would not face deportation in the event of the country's withdrawal from the EU.Greens:  Progressively reduce UK immigration controls. Migrants illegally in the UK for over five years will be allowed to remain unless they pose a serious danger to public safety. More legal rights for asylum seekers.Taxes and the economyConservatives: Eradicate the deficit by 2018 and secure an overall budget surplus by 2019-20. Achieve this by spending cuts, not tax rises, while raising NHS spending. An income tax cut for 30 million people by 2020. Tax would start to kick in at £12,500 a year, instead of £10,500. This will cost £5.6bn. The higher tax rate, 40%, would start at £50,000 instead of £41,900, again by 2020, at a cost of £1.6bn. This will be paid for through £25bn in additional spending cuts and economic growth. No increases in VAT.Labour: Get the current budget into surplus and the national debt falling ""as soon as possible in the next parliament"". No additional borrowing for new spending. Reintroduce the 50p top rate of income tax for earnings over £150,000.  Cut income tax for 24 million people by bringing back the 10p rate, paid for by scrapping the Married Couples' Tax Allowance. Bring in a ""mansion tax"" on properties worth over £2m, to raise £1.2bn. A tax on bankers' bonuses. A 5% pay cut for every government minister. Push for UK overseas territories to be put on an international blacklist if they refuse to co-operate with a drive against tax avoidance. No increases in VAT or National Insurance contributions.Lib Dems: Raise the personal allowance - the point at which you start paying income tax - to £11,000 in April 2016 and then to £12,500 by 2020. ""Strict new fiscal rules"" to ensure the deficit has gone by April 2018, with the wealthy contributing the most. The Lib Dems invented the ""mansion tax"" but in contrast to Labour have set out how it would operate - along similar lines to council tax bands. There are also Lib Dem plans to increase capital gains tax - paid on profits from second homes or shares - from 28% to 35%. Impose an additional 8% rate of corporation tax on UK banks to raise an extra £1bn a year to help pay off the deficit.SNP: Oppose UK plans in the Infrastructure Bill which will allow oil and gas drilling and hydraulic fracturing beneath people's homes without consent. Invest in offshore wind farming. Support an international bank tax and limits to industry bonuses.Plaid Cymru: Build a Green Skills Construction College, specialising in green energy. Establish a publicly-owned energy company. Establish a publicly-owned Bank of Wales business investment bank. Enforce a living wage. Give devolved nations an equal say in institutions that affect everyone's lives, such as the Bank of England.UKIP: Increase the personal allowance to the level of full-time minimum wage earnings, about £13,500, by 2020. Abolish inheritance tax. Introduce a 35% income tax rate between £42,285 and £55,000, at which point the 40% rate becomes payable. Set up a Treasury Commission to design a turnover tax on large businesses. Cut foreign aid budget by £9bn a year. Scrap HS2. Save £8bn a year in membership fees by leaving the EU.  Lower the VAT rate charged on restorations to listed buildings.Greens: People earning more than £100,000 a year would pay 50% income tax. Wealth tax of 1% to 2% on people worth £3m or more. Renationalise the railways and energy companies. Scrap HS2. Allow councils to impose extra business rates on out-of-town supermarkets to fund small local businesses. Crackdown on tax avoidance by multinationals. Allow ""the current dependence on economic growth to cease, and allow zero or negative growth to be feasible without individual hardship"". Commit Britain to a ""zero carbon"" future. Cut rail and bus fares by an average of 10%. Enforce a cap on bankers' bonuses.The NHSConservatives:  Chancellor George Osborne says he will put an extra £2bn into frontline health services across the UK, which he described as a ""down payment"" on a plan drawn up by NHS bosses calling for an extra £8bn a year above inflation by 2020. In England, everyone would be able to see a GP seven days a week by 2020. Recruit 5,000 more doctors.Labour:  Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said Labour would commit an extra £2.5bn a year above Mr Osborne's plan. The money will come from three sources - a new ""mansion"" tax, clamping down on tax avoidance by big corporations and a new tax on tobacco companies. Patients in England would get a GP appointment within 48 hours and would not have to wait longer than a week for cancer tests and results. Scrap the Health and Social Care Act and end ""creeping privatisation"" of the NHS.  Integrate health and social care services into a system of ""whole-person care"". Give greater priority to mental health services. Replace the Cancer Drugs Fund in England when it runs out in 2016 with a £330m fund to improve access to innovative cancer drugs, surgery and radiotherapy. Recruit 5,000 more healthcare workers to help patients stay in their homes and introduce new safety checks to identify people at risk of hospitalisation. Prioritise child mental health by increasing the proportion of the mental health budget spent on children.Lib Dems: An extra £1bn for the NHS every year, to be funded by - amongst other things - making higher earners pay more tax on their shares. Half of this will go towards mental health. Ensure that spending on the NHS rises in line with growth in the economy. People who need therapy for conditions such as depression will be guaranteed treatment within 18 weeks. For young patients experiencing psychosis for the first time treatment will be provided within two weeks of being referred by a GP. This is all going to happen from April, with more mental health targets to follow if the Lib Dems return to government. Wants a cross-party review of the future of NHS funding.SNP: Reduce the number of senior managers in the NHS by 25% over the next parliament. Streamline the work of health boards. Real terms increases in year-on-year NHS spending.Plaid Cymru: Recruit 1,000 extra doctors to the Welsh NHS over two terms of a Plaid government. Offer financial incentives for recruiting doctors to areas and specialisms where there are, or are predicted to be, shortages. Encourage innovation and attract more research funding, in part by increasing research and development funding as government finance allows. Improve training for postgraduate doctors and stop them being used to ""plug gaps"" in staff rotas. More recruitment from within the EU to fill vacancies and using international doctors to staff the NHS while a new generation of Welsh doctors are trained.UKIP: An extra £3bn per year in NHS funding paid for by quitting the EU and through ""middle management"" cuts. Keep NHS free at the point of delivery. Stop any further use of PFI, and encourage local authorities to buy out their PFI contracts early where it is affordable to do so. Ensure all visitors and migrants who have been here for fewer than five years have NHS-approved medical insurance as a condition of entry to UK, with £200m of the £2bn saved to be spent on ending hospital parking charges in England. Bring back state-enrolled nurses and return powers to matrons. Monitor and Care Quality Commission to be replaced with elected county health boards. Stop spending £90m a year on gastric band and breast enhancement operations.Greens: Funding to be diverted away from centralised facilities towards community healthcare, illness prevention and health promotion.  Stop privatisation. Abolish prescription charges. Dedicated NHS Tax to go direct to the health service. Ban proactive recruitment of non-British NHS staff from overseas. A complete ban on the promotion of tobacco and alcohol products, including sponsorship.Security, defence and foreign affairsConservatives: Hold a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU by 2017, after negotiating the return of some powers from Brussels. Protect foreign aid budget. Replace Trident.Labour:  Push for reform of European Union and prevent Britain from ""sleepwalking"" towards exit. Commit in law to holding a Strategic Defence and Security Review every 5 years. Outlaw discrimination and abuse of Armed Forces personnel.Lib Dems: Campaign to reduce the number of Trident nuclear submarines. Push for greater European Union efficiency. SNP: Oppose nuclear weapons and push for removal of Trident submarines from Scotland. In 2010, proposed a Scottish Centre for Reconciliation and Conflict Resolution, to promote peaceful alternatives to armed conflict. Maintain 0.7% commitment to foreign aid. Enhanced role for Scotland within the UK in Europe, particularly in fisheries policy.Plaid Cymru: Honour commitment of 0.7% of budget used for foreign aid. Campaign for cancellation of developing countries' debts. Support the Fair Trade movement. Support the 'Tobin' or 'Robin hood' tax as a means of encouraging more responsibility and stability in the global markets. Reform the IMF and World Bank in order to improve regulation and accountability. Continue membership of the EU, but campaign for democratic reform. Support minority nations and minority language speakers around the world. Pass a Military Wellbeing Act to promote and safeguard the physical and mental health and wellbeing of military personnel.UKIP:  Leave the European Union. Remove the passports of any person who has gone to fight for a terrorist organisation and deport anyone who has committed a terrorist act. Cut foreign aid budget by £9bn. Create a Veterans Department to look after the interests of ex-service men and women.Greens: Referendum on Britain's EU membership. Want reform of EU to hand powers back to local communities. Boost overseas aid to 1% of GDP within 10 years. Scrap Britain's nuclear weapons. Take the UK out of NATO unilaterally. End the so-called ""special relationship"" between the UK and the US.  Stop EU-US free trade deal TTIP. JobsConservatives: Create three million apprenticeships to be paid for by benefit cuts.Labour: Guarantee a job for under 25s unemployed for over a year and adults unemployed for more than two years. As many young people to go on an apprenticeship as currently go to university by 2025. Create a million new high technology, green jobs by 2025. Ban ""exploitative"" zero hour contracts.Lib Dems: An extra £1 an hour for the lowest paid apprentices. Campaign to create a million more jobs.SNP: Introduce gender quotas on public boards. Living wage ""a central priority"" in all Scottish government contracts. Continue the 'small business bonus'.Plaid Cymru: Provide rates relief for small businesses. Increase the number and value of contracts from Welsh public bodies that go to firms within Wales.UKIP: Allow firms to offer jobs to British workers first ""without the fear of being sued for discrimination"".Greens: A national energy conservation scheme to create thousands of new jobs. The party wants to create ""sustainable jobs"" and promotes more local production of food and goods.Education Conservatives: Protect England's schools budget - from reception entry at age four or five to the end of GCSEs at 16 - in cash terms although funding per pupil will not keep pace with inflation. Pre-school and post 16 education not ring fenced. Convert up to 3,500 more schools judged by Ofsted to ""require improvement"" into academies. ""War on illiteracy and innumeracy"". State primary schools in England that repeatedly failed to have a proportion of year-six pupil pass times tables and writing tests be forced to become academies, or have sponsorship replaced if already an academy. Opposed to giving votes to 16 and 17-year-olds for UK-wide general elections and local elections in England.Labour:  Increase the overall education budget in England, including schools, nurseries, Sure Start and provision for 16-to 18-year-olds, by at least the rate of inflation, although per-pupil funding is not specifically protected, meaning some of the increase will be eaten up by rising pupil numbers. Parents of primary school children would be guaranteed childcare from 8am to 6pm. The amount of free childcare for three and four year olds would be increased from 15 to 25 hours a week. Compulsory sex and relationship education in all schools. Refuse to grant business rate relief to independent schools unless they can show a ""meaningful impact"" on state schools through a new School Partnership Standard, for example by lending teaching staff or assisting in university admissions procedures. Committed to extending the franchise to 16 and 17-year-olds in elections across the UK. Double the number of Sure Start childcare places to more than 118,000. Tighten up the rules on primary school class sizes to ensure they do not have more than 30 pupils.Lib Dems: Protect the education budget from cuts. Guarantee qualified teachers and a core curriculum set by independent experts, as well as compulsory sex education, in all state schools including academies and free schools. More money for disadvantaged school children and free childcare for all two year olds. A two-thirds discount on all local bus fares for young people aged 16-21. Supports lowering the voting age to 16 in all UK elections.SNP: Guaranteed free 30 hours of childcare a week for three and four-year-olds in Scotland, up from 16 hours. Maintain lack of tuition fees at Scottish universities, and offer financial support in grants and loans to students. Continue to build and refurbish schools. Lower voting age to 16 in all UK elections.Plaid Cymru: Introduce a compulsory modern foreign language GCSE in secondary schools and the teaching of modern foreign languages in primary schools. Look at ways to strengthen the teaching of Welsh history and culture. Oppose foundation schools, academies and free schools. Look at moving from a per-pupil funding mechanism to a funding model based on the catchment area. Will not support any further increases in tuition fees for higher education students, and will seek the abolition of tuition fees as and when public finances allow. Supports lowering the voting age to 16 for elections to the Welsh Assembly and the UK Parliament.UKIP: More grammar schools. Scrap sex education for children aged under seven. Scrap tuition fees for students from poorer backgrounds who take degree courses in the sciences, technology, maths or engineering. Greater emphasis on vocational education with new Apprenticeship Qualification Option. School governing boards must be made up of at least 30% parents of children at the school. Allow universities to charge same amount for EU students as non-EU students.Greens: End performance related pay for teachers. Replace Ofsted with an independent National Council for Educational Excellence. Bring Free Schools and Academies into local authority control.

Withdraw Jobseeker's Allowance from young people after six months unless they take part in ""community projects"". And 18 to 21-year-olds wouldn't be entitled to housing benefit. Ban on zero-hours contracts which stop people getting work elsewhere. Raise the personal allowance - the point at which you start paying income tax - to £11,000 in April 2016 and then to £12,500 by 2020, which means that if you work on minimum wage for 30 hours you will pay no income tax. Young people out of work, education or training for six months will have to do unpaid community work to get benefits. This will apply to about 50,000 18 to 21-year-olds. Universal benefits for pensioners, such as free bus passes, TV licences for the over 75s and the winter fuel allowance. will once again be protected. Labour: Freeze energy prices until 2017. Increase in the minimum wage from £6.50-an-hour to £8-an-hour by 2020. Rises in child benefit capped at 1% for the first two years of the next parliament. Winter fuel allowance would be withdrawn from the wealthiest pensioners. Repeal what the government calls the spare room subsidy, dubbed the ""bedroom tax"" by Labour.  A million interest-free loans to help people insulate their homes. Rail fares would be capped. Double the amount of paid paternity leave available to new fathers from two to four weeks, and increase statutory paternity pay to £260 a week.Lib Dems: Raise the personal allowance - the point at which you start paying income tax - to £11,000 in April 2016 and then to £12,500 by 2020 (the Conservatives are promising the same thing). Nick Clegg has said he would not accept Conservative plans to freeze working-age benefits without taxing the rich too. He hasn't said he would block welfare cuts altogether. Withdraw eligibility for the Winter Fuel Payment and free TV Licence from pensioners on the 40% rate of income tax. A ""yellow card"" system to deal with benefit claimants breaking the rules, rather than imposing sanctions without warning.SNP: Oppose cuts to in-work benefits. Support moves to extend paternity leave. Introduce a maximum combined withdrawal rate for benefits and reforms to employment support allowance and cold weather payments. Protect policies such as concessionary travel for older Scots.Plaid Cymru: Move away from complex and expensive means testing for child-related benefits. Continue to campaign for the introduction of a living pension during the period of the next parliament for those aged 80 and over. UKIP: Only pay child benefit for the first two children for new claimants. Increase the Carers' Allowance to the same level as Jobseekers' Allowance (JSA) and pay a higher rate of JSA if you've been in work and already made tax and National Insurance contributions. Prevent anyone taking up permanent residence in Britain unless they're able to support themselves and any dependents they bring with them for at least five years and stop them receiving benefits. Stop paying child benefit for children who don't live in Britain. Scrap what UKIP calls the ""detested bedroom tax"". Boost ""credit unions"".Greens: The party backs a Citizen's Income, a fixed amount of £72 income a week to be paid to every individual, whether they are in work or not, to be funded by higher taxes on the better off and green levies.  But in the short-term it would increase the minimum wage to £10 by 2020. Ban zero hours contracts. Axe the ""bedroom tax"". Abolish the work capability assessment and restore the level of the former disability living allowance. Scrap the government's welfare cap, which limits the maximum amount a household can claim annually to £26,000 a year."

2015-04-17,Elephant trap?,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32047998,"The campaign has not even got under way, yet in the space of a couple of hours we have now been treated to not only one election pledge, but to two. The prime minister ruled out raising VAT if re-elected - while Labour said National Insurance contributions wouldn't go up.Usually politicians fudge the question of tax rises.  When he was leader of the opposition David Cameron himself said ""we have no need to raise taxes"" - before hiking up VAT after polling day.Famously, John Major said he had ""no plans"" to put up the sales tax -  before his chancellor did just that.And when he appeared in front of the cross-party Treasury committee of MPs on Tuesday, the current chancellor seemed to be continuing that tradition.  Under repeated questioning, George Osborne said: ""The policies we have do not involve a VAT rise.""That formulation appeared to give him not so much wriggle room, but an entire wriggle mansion.Labour assumed their campaign warning of further VAT rises to come under the Tories was very much on the money.But George Osborne's allies are suggesting privately that he had, in fact, been walking Ed Miliband to the edge of an elephant trap, then beckoning the prime minister to push the opposition leader in.Ed Miliband's strategists fully expected Mr Cameron to repeat the chancellor's obfuscation on tax at the final Prime Minister's Questions of this Parliament. They would then have expanded on the theme, inviting the prime minister to answer other difficult questions - then say he wasn't being straight with the British people for avoiding them.But the Labour leader was completely wrong-footed when first the prime minister said he would rule out a VAT rise and then counter-punched, inquiring if Labour would now rule out an increase in National Insurance contributions.Ed Miliband dodged the question and what could have been downbeat Conservative benches, uneasy over the prime minister's announcement this week of his retirement plans, were given something to cheer.The reason Ed Miliband didn't respond is because he was holding the National Insurance pledge back for Labour's manifesto.But that soon became unsustainable - so the other Ed, the shadow chancellor Ed Balls, had to undertake a hasty round of the TV studios to do just that.When I spoke to him mid-tour, he put on a brave face. His view was that George Osborne, having raised VAT from 17.5% to 20%, wanted to give the issue a low profile - whereas the prime minister had now made the mistake of putting it centre stage. And he believed David Cameron's promise would be judged against his past VAT-raising performance.He defended Ed Miliband's reluctance to talk about National Insurance as he felt it would have been ""inappropriate"" to announce Labour tax policy at PMQs.So the prime minister - always a better tactician than strategist - can at least satisfy himself that he smoked Labour out on NI and disrupted at least one entry in their election campaign grid.But the exchange actually raised more questions than it answered.If the main parties are ruling out further potential sources of revenue, but still committing themselves to eradicating a £90bn black hole in the public finances, will they now be under more pressure during the election campaign to spell out in much greater detail exactly what they intend to cut?"
2015-04-17,Who's next?,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32031343,"David Cameron's declaration that he will not seek a third term in office if he retains power in May has immediately stoked interest in who might fill his shoes when he's gone. Here are the likely - and perhaps less obvious - possibilities.Claim? As chancellor of the exchequer he's the man in charge of the purse strings and master strategist - and reportedly the PM's favourite to succeed him, although he hasn't said as much. Mr Cameron's right-hand man has had an image makeover of late, with a new haircut and a diet to shed some pounds. And he has seemingly recovered from his ""omnishambles"" Budget in 2012, with his latest - and last Budget - of the parliament giving the Tories a lead in some polls. He's said to be well liked among Conservative cabinet ministers and backbench MPs, whose support is vital for any candidate wanting to take on the party leadership. He shas some work to do among grassroots Tory members, however, coming fifth in ConservativeHome's latest online poll of party members on future leaders.Latest odds: 10/1 (according to William Hill)What's he said? ""The prime minister leads a strong team but what you see from him is answering a direct question with a direct answer. I think that's really refreshing. He says he's going to serve that full five years so the real question facing the country now is do you want the strong leadership of David Cameron that's delivering zero inflation and record jobs or do you want the chaos and incompetence of Ed Miliband.""Claim? The longest-serving home secretary in 50 years, she is only the second Conservative woman to secure one of the top four jobs in government. In her role, she has talked tough on immigration and crime and taken on the Police Federation. And she is popular with Tory activists, consistently occupying either first or second place in ConservativeHome's online polls on future party leaders. There have long been claims of Mrs May positioning herself for the top job, with reported tensions between her and the prime minister. Critics say she lacks charisma and micro-manages - while some cannot forget her coining the now infamous ""nasty party"" phrase at a Tory conference in 2002, but supporters say she is a formidable operator, and have dubbed her Britain's Angela Merkel. Latest odds: 9/2What's she said? ""My view is very simple, David Cameron is a first class leader of the party and a first class prime minister and I hope he is going to be doing that for a very long time."" (Desert Island discs, 23 November 2014)Claim? The blonde bombshell and mayor of London who can seemingly reach voters that others in the party cannot. Casting aside a rather chequered past he steered the capital through the 2012 Olympics, launched the successful and popular ""Boris bikes"" and got rid of London's ""bendy buses"" in favour of the new Routemaster double deckers. Mr Johnson hopes to revive his Westminster parliamentary career at the general election. He has been tipped by many to take the helm of the Conservative Party, and has not discouraged the idea. Like Theresa May, he is also a favourite among the grassroots of the party, pipping her to the top spot in ConservativeHome's latest poll of party members on future leaders. (he's ahead by 2 points). Critics say the gaffe-prone politician is not the right man for the job, but his supporters point to his wide-spread appeal.Latest odds: 9/4What's he said? ""I think what David Cameron is saying is banal and obvious. There has already been a leader of the Conservative Party for ten years and he's done an outstanding job. What he's saying now is that he wants to serve through to 2020 and that is frankly what we need him to do... five more years is what this country needs. I'm not entirely certain I see what the story is. He was asked a straight question, are you going to serve a third term like Mrs Thatcher or Tony Blair and he said no, because he thinks that ten years on top of British politics is an incredibly long time.""Claim? A self-made millionaire and devotee of Margaret Thatcher, he is regarded as one of the Conservatives' fastest-rising stars. The Treasury minister-turned-culture secretary became the first of the 2010 intake of MPs to reach cabinet level, and the first Asian male Conservative cabinet minister. He's currently polling well among the Conservative grassroots, who voted him third most preferable leader in ConservativeHome's latest online future leader poll. David Cameron recently said he wants to see a British Asian prime minister in his lifetime.Latest odds: 12/1Claim? Currently holding one of the four great offices of state - foreign secretary - Mr Hammond's name has often cropped up whenever talk of leadership contenders has emerged. He has built up an impressive CV in government since the Conservatives came to power in 2010, being first awarded the job of transport secretary before his promotion to defence secretary where he stayed for three years. He's regarded by many commentators as being a potential candidate for the Tory right. He seems to have work to do among party activists, scoring only 4% in ConservativeHome's future leader poll.Latest odds: 12/1"
2015-04-17,Cereal number,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-magazine-monitor-31962592,"David Cameron has declared he won't seek a third term as prime minister, citing an advertising slogan for Shredded Wheat used in the UK more than 30 years ago. What's its enduring power, asks Justin Parkinson.The hotel kitchen staff are in disbelief. Someone in room 147 has ordered three Shredded Wheat. The maid transports them upstairs to find England cricketer Ian Botham waiting at a table, dressed in full whites.The maid leaves. Botham hides one of the Shredded Wheat under a napkin and winks to camera. Cue music, as the slogan ""Shredded Wheat. Bet you can't eat three"" appears.This advert and others featuring football manager Brian Clough and the actor Richard Kiel, who played Jaws in James Bond films, have not run for some time. Nestle, which owns the brand, says the last probably aired in 1984.But their message seems to have waned little. Telling the BBC he would only serve a limited time in Downing Street, David Cameron said: ""Terms are like Shredded Wheat - two are wonderful but three might just be too many.""The prime minister's reprise was unlikely to be accidental, says Thayne Forbes, joint managing director of the brand-valuation company Intangible Business. ""Everybody would empathise with the view that three Shredded Wheat would probably be too much,"" he says. ""The slogan suggests people shouldn't overdo it. It sounds modest and reasoned.""As marketing goes, it might seem counter-intuitive, as it discourages excessive consumption. But it also sounds honest and unexploitative.Other advertising slogans and themes are in wide use in public and political discourse. Examples include Marmite being a by-word for divisiveness - a ""Marmite person"" is either loved or hated. Cameron has twice referred to Ronseal - the woodcare product that does ""exactly what it says on the tin"". But Shredded Wheat, its best-known slogan having lain dormant for so long, appears to be used less often. The cereal, created in the US in the 1890s, has long been sold as good for the evolving British lifestyle. A newspaper advert in 1902 described it as ""a relief from the monotony of everlasting porridge"", while, by 1943, it was ""an ideal food for all war workers"". The 1980s saw an emphasis on ""simple, honest goodness"", while, in the 2000s, its long heritage and reliability was promoted.""It's a good association for Cameron,"" says Forbes. ""He must have been brought up on it, like lots of other people. It will be great marketing for Shredded Wheat to have the slogan used after so many years, too.""Subscribe to the BBC News Magazine's email newsletter to get articles sent to your inbox"
2015-04-17,Are you 'cosmopolitan'?,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32021853,"The rise of UKIP heralds the emergence of a new divide in British politics, with cosmopolitan voters on one side and non-cosmopolitan ones on the other, argues Jeremy Cliffe.We hear a lot about UKIP these days. The party stole the show at the local and European elections last year, then again in the autumn when it lured two Conservative MPs to defect.  In the past weeks alone there have been three much-discussed television programmes about the party: ""Meet the Ukippers"", ""Farage Fans and UKIP Lovers"" and ""100 Days of UKIP"". At the upcoming general election the party will probably increase its share of seats in Westminster - and will certainly affect the results in dozens of other constituencies by taking votes from the other parties. But ask some of those academics who have been watching UKIP's rise, and they will tell you that it is just one part of a bigger story. We are all used to the left-right divide in politics: a spectrum of different views on how much the government should tax, spend, regulate and otherwise intervene in the economy. But according to Dr Rob Ford of Manchester University, UKIP exists on a different axis, one to do with cultural rather than economic matters. This new political scale is ever more prominent in British political life.Radio 4's Analysis programmeOn the one end of it is what you might call a ""cosmopolitan"" philosophy: a relaxed, liberal attitude to issues concerning national identity (like immigration) and to questions of morality and lifestyle (like gay marriage). On the other end is a ""non-cosmopolitan"" outlook: more nationalist, socially conservative and less comfortable with social change, or in other words the ideological stance often associated with typical UKIP voters. This divide cuts across the left-right scale: there are cosmopolitan and non-cosmopolitan voters in both the Conservative and the Labour camps, which is why UKIP takes support from both.Lots of things are making this cosmopolitanism divide more important. One is that the old class-based, ideological conflict between left and right has declined. Dr James Tilley of Oxford University argues that politicians are partly to blame. The economic philosophies of the Conservative and Labour parties are so similar, he argues, that other, cultural issues are becoming more important. Another factor is the growing gap between the generations: the difference in outlook between the cosmopolitan young and less cosmopolitan, older voters is greater than it was in the past (partly due to the recent rise in levels of university education, which tend to correlate with liberal views). This trend presents the established parties with some difficult questions. As Dr Ford puts it, they ""have to try and deal with this rising value divide, particularly now that UKIP has mobilised it into the political debate."" ""They have to make a move,"" he adds, ""but any move that they make risks making their position worse with one or the other of these groups of voters."" Sound too cosmopolitan, and the parties risk losing supporters to UKIP. Try to ""out-UKIP UKIP"", and they could alienate their younger, more socially liberal supporters. So both are doing the political splits, trying to reconcile the cosmopolitans within their ranks with the non-cosmopolitans. Witness the tortuous attempts by Ed Miliband to sound tough on immigration without sounding too tough. Witness, too, the recent struggles of David Cameron to persuade social conservatives in his party that gay marriage can be an innately conservative institution. In the long-term, this divide will become less problematic. That is because over the years the country will tilt towards the cosmopolitan end of this new spectrum. So says Penny Young of NatCen, the research organisation that conducts the extensive British Social Attitudes survey. Various demographic factors explain this trend. The country as a whole is becoming more accepting of same-sex relationships. Younger voters are more relaxed about things like immigration and national identity than were previous generations when they were young, suggesting that the overall population will tilt in an internationalist direction over time. And ever more parts of the country are acquiring the ethnic and social diversity once confined to the inner cities, a trend that generally makes people more comfortable with immigration. According to Dr Ford the question is therefore: how should the main political parties navigate this period of transition? It would be wrong to simply abandon the swathes of voters at the less cosmopolitan end of the scale; voters who are usually older and more isolated than the average member of the population.Yet the politicians do need to adapt to the changing attitudes of British society and be honest with voters rather than pandering to views that, deep down, they do not share. This quandary may not decide the upcoming general election, but in the established parties savvy strategists with an eye to elections in 2020 and beyond are grappling with it nonetheless. That is a wise move."
2015-04-17,Dudley debate,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32015334,"I met Afzal Amin for the first time on Friday, but I already knew who he was. In Dudley North, the seat he was selected by the Conservatives to fight in the general election, Mr Amin had become hard to avoid. When I first looked at the local newspaper online, the pages were surrounded by ""Amin"" logos in the preferred Tory shade of blue.Not long after we met, he asked me to pose for a photo, snapped by one of his campaign team, and doubtless rapidly tweeted out to followers of the would-be MP.Perhaps no surprise that the man running such a disciplined operation has served in the army and been to Sandhurst. That was very much the message he delivered on Friday, as he addressed school and college pupils at a hustings in Dudley which I'd been invited to chair.There was combative debate, too, not least with his Labour rival, the MP Ian Austin. Both men knew the Dudley contest was critical for their respective parties; Ian Austin held the seat by just over 600 votes in 2010. Just as David Cameron was denied a majority by failing to take seats like this one, so Ed Miliband is unlikely to be in No 10 if Labour loses Dudley North.He was self-confident and fluent. The only obvious mis-step came right at the end, when he interrupted Vicky Duckworth, the Green candidate for the neighbouring seat. She expressed the opinion that politics often seemed to be about men shouting at each other; Mr Amin complained she was engaging in gender bias.A few weeks ago, one Conservative MP who knows him well and respects his talents, said Afzal Amin had warned him of the risks of over-confidence. He thought he risked running before he could walk.Well, he stumbled badly this weekend. Whatever the purpose of his contacts with the English Defence League - and he strongly disputes claims that he wanted them to hold a protest that would then be called off, for which he could then take the credit - the exposure has damaged him and, potentially, the prospects of his party re-taking the seat.In February, the EDL staged a rally against plans for a new mosque in the town. As the Mail on Sunday story makes clear, Afzal Amin pleaded with them beforehand not to hold that demonstration; but it went ahead anyway. It's what happened subsequently which will feature in Tuesday's disciplinary hearing.Over the weekend, I put his defence to a very senior Conservative source - that this was an attempt to broker a compromise in order to bring together a divided community. The arch response: Dudley isn't Kandahar.Nor do I think from my visits to the town, where I'm going to be based for the general election, will people in Dudley appreciate being painted as somewhere riven by racial discord.True, Dudley was the scene of one of England's earliest race riots. But that was in 1962. Although the controversy over replacing the mosque - currently in a converted school and inadequate for the numbers who want to worship there - has been running for a decade, community relations are generally good. Even those who don't want a new mosque didn't want the EDL protestors - nor to be fair the anti-fascist counter-demonstrators who followed them.As for the Conservative Party, the view of the national leadership is that you don't collaborate with the EDL. Not least because the Tories are still struggling to bury some historic baggage in the Black Country: Enoch Powell was an MP in Wolverhampton when he delivered his Rivers of Blood speech about immigration in 1968.Four years before that, there was the notorious election in Smethwick which the Conservatives were accused of winning by wooing white voters with an offensive rhyme suggesting who'd they'd get as a neighbour if they voted Labour. Afzal Amin grew up in Smethwick so he should be aware of that history. He was, until his suspension on Saturday, one of about 17% of Conservative parliamentary candidates who are not white. The party is proud of that, but it's still struggling to translate that into votes.Afzal Amin may believe that he can persuade the party to lift the suspension when he meets party officials on Tuesday. I have my doubts. Even if they accept his defence, will the other parties be so charitable? The allegations would follow him on the campaign trail, and make planned visits by cabinet ministers next to impossible.On Friday, just before the hustings in Dudley began, Afzal Amin gave me his business card. It introduces him as 'prospective member of Parliament Dudley North'. I think I'll keep it; it could yet become a collector's item."

2015-04-18,Bid to change Speaker election rules,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32061097,"A last-minute bid to change the way the Speaker of the House of Commons is elected is to be debated by MPs.Labour criticised the government motion, to be debated on the final day before the dissolution of Parliament, saying the Conservatives were ""trying to play politics with the speakership"".Under the proposals, a secret ballot would decide whether there should be a contested election for the post.MPs currently have to file through the division lobbies to cast their vote.This means it is clear who does or does not back the incumbent as Speaker.Labour's shadow leader of the Commons Angela Eagle raised the party's concerns in the House on Wednesday evening, questioning whether the motion was within parliamentary rules.Current Speaker John Bercow is - technically - one of them, but many Tory MPs have never liked him.They resent his personal style and some believe he is far from impartial in the way he conducts business in the Commons.Attempts by some to force a vote on his resumption as Speaker in 2010 came to nothing. There have been the occasional measured jibes at him from the prime minister. Other Tories reportedly went much further and formed a group whose members had all been reprimanded by him. But the Speaker is a reformer who believes passionately that the people who elect the members, and pay the bills, should come first.The last act of the coalition looks like being an attempt to unseat him. And they are very serious about it.One Tory MP fighting an important marginal seat had been cleared by his party to be away from Parliament but he is now staying for the vote, such is the importance of it.She told Deputy Speaker Lindsay Hoyle: ""It's just come to my attention that the government has tabled a motion for debate on the final day of this Parliament, with no notice whatsoever to myself as shadow leader of the House, proposing changes to the way in which the Speaker of this House is elected.""Procedural matters in this House, with no consultation with the opposition, no consultation with the chair of the committee itself, for debate in only one hour tomorrow.""Mr Hoyle said the motion had been ""rightly or wrongly"" agreed to on Tuesday, saying that ""business of the House is decided by the government, not by the chair.""A spokesman for Commons Leader William Hague said the motion had been tabled as a free hour had opened up in Thursday's business after the House of Lords approved the Modern Slavery Bill.The proposed change would apply when a Speaker wishes to continue in the post after a general election.Under the current rules, if the Speaker's re-appointment is objected to, a division is held, with MPs choosing to back or oppose the Speaker in the division lobbies.The replacement of this method with a secret ballot was suggested in 2010 by a committee of MPs, which said the public method ""can be seen as a deterrent to the House expressing its views honestly"".MPs will now debate whether this change should be made."

2015-04-18,MPs warn on growth of UK jihadists,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32059813,"Not enough is being done to prevent people leaving the UK to join Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, a group of MPs has warned.Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said Britain must win their ""hearts and minds"".The committee's report comes as the BBC launches a database tracking British jihadists in Syria and Iraq. It shows that many people left in clusters from certain UK areas - often due to friendships and peer groups. The MPs' report argued that preventative work with communities, families and international partners was ""vital"" and needs to be a top priority for the Home Office.  ""The number of cases being brought to public attention should ring alarm bells,"" said Labour MP Mr Vaz.  ""This must be a relentless battle for hearts and minds, and without a strong counter-narrative we are in danger of failing to prevent even more departures. We are at the edge of a cliff."" The BBC has been tracking the stories of the men, women, boys and girls who have gone to Syria and Iraq to understand why they go, where they go from and what happens to them. By analysing around 160 profiles, it reveals the way in which people have travelled in clusters - a group of three young friends from Coventry, another group from Portsmouth, drawn out by one person they knew, others in Cardiff linked to people involved in an extremist organisation. Social media might play a part but face-to-face contact appears just as, if not more, important, according to the database.It includes the stories of: The BBC research emphasises the extent to which real-world contacts, rather than just online connections, are often a key driver of radicalisation and intent to travel to Iraq and Syria. Some of the experts who appeared before the Home Affairs Committee also argued the internet was a secondary influence. They said that universities and prisons were among the two most significant places where radicalisation occurred. A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police, which was not aware of the report, said it would have ""welcomed the opportunity"" to have given evidence to the committee and that it planned to look at the report in detail.The disappearance of schoolgirls Shamima Begum, Amira Abase, both 15, and Kadiza Sultana, 16, from east London in February, raised questions as to who could have done more to prevent their departure. After taking evidence from the police and the families of the girls among others, Mr Vaz said their case suffered from a ""lack of immediate action"". He added: ""Schools and the police must inform parents immediately, and work with them even if there is the smallest hint of radicalisation, or a close association with someone who is thought to have been radicalised.""However, the Met Police spokesman defended the speed of the police response to the schoolgirls' disappearance.  He said the committee's criticism was ""misleading"", pointing to the evidence given by both UK and Turkish authorities of ""rapid exchanges"" between the two.The committee's report said there needed to be an advice service which would be a less extreme step than calling the anti-terrorist hotline.The Association of Chief Police Officer's lead officer for the government's anti-terror strategy Prevent, Chief Constable Sir Peter Fahy, agreed that more needed to be done.However, he said the police ""do not have the capacity"" to routinely work with every school in the country.He added: ""The police service will play its part but the prime responsibility for dissuading young people from getting involved in extremist activity has to lie with parents, families and carers.""The committee also pointed to weaknesses in information sharing with airlines and other countries. It said greater care needed to be taken at airport check-in desks when people were travelling to destinations of concern - namely Syria, Somalia, Iraq and Nigeria, as well as neighbouring countries, such as Turkey. The report said police also needed to work faster to alert overseas partners and airlines when there were concerns over individuals.There were signs that some of the girls had followed extremist accounts on social media, the report said.The committee said that social media companies, such as Facebook and Twitter, should be prepared to suspend accounts when there is evidence they are being used to promote violent extremism.  The report also said it was disappointed the Home Office had not implemented a programme for individuals returning to Britain where there is evidence they had fought in Syria.Security officials estimate that some 600 Britons have left the country to join IS - and while around half may have returned, many are still out there - and some have died.  The BBC project includes detailed profiles of individuals which can be searched, based on hometown, age and gender, as well as those who have been convicted in the courts or who are believed to have been killed."

If not, the prince's private letters will either remain confidential, as the sender intended, or they'll be exposed to a large and inquisitive audience.

That will be a clear pledge from us.""He accused Mr Cameron of making an ""out of the blue, panicky"" announcement on VAT that ""no one in Britain will believe"".Labour, which has already announced plans to increase the top rate of income tax and impose a new ""mansion tax"" on high value properties, insists its plans are fully costed and will not require additional tax hikes if it wins May's general election.Mr Miliband began his final head-to-head encounter with Mr Cameron before the election by joking that the PM had ""announced his retirement plans"" - a reference to a BBC interview in which the prime minister said he would not serve a third term if the Tories remained in power.Challenging Mr Cameron to give a ""straight answer to a straight question"", Mr Miliband pressed him on whether he would rule out a rise in VAT after the election, as Labour had done.In response, the prime minister immediately said ""yes"", prompting loud cheers in turn from the Conservative benches. He contrasted what he said was a ""clear promise"" with Labour's unwillingness to rule out a rise in National Insurance.""I answered a very simple question about VAT. I ruled out an increase... straight answer to him, straight question from me. I have ruled out VAT. Will he rule out national insurance contributions. Yes or no?"" Mr Cameron added: ""We all know this is Labour's job tax. This is their tax of choice. This is what they clobber working people, families and enterprises with.""But Mr Miliband responded by saying there was ""only one person who is going to raise taxes on working families and that is him"".He said nobody would believe Mr Cameron on VAT ""because of his extreme spending plans, because his numbers do not add up and because he promised it last time and broke his promise"".Mr Cameron, he added, had broken other promises made before the last election to reduce annual net migration below 100,000 and not to pursue a major structural re-organisation of the NHS, adding that it was ""time for a better plan and time for a Labour government"".But Mr Cameron suggested a future Labour government would result in the ""chaos of economic crisis"", with Ed Miliband being ""held hostage"" by the SNP.The packed session provided a last opportunity for the two men to rally their MPs and set out their arguments before the start of the election campaign next week.Speaking after the exchanges and the other parties' tax pledges, deputy prime minister Nick Clegg said the Lib Dems ""don't need to raise VAT, national insurance or headline rates of income tax or corporation tax either"".""There are other taxes and other tax loopholes that we can increase or close in order to balance the books,"" he said.

2015-04-18,Met police 'had files on MPs in 90s',https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32044580,"A former undercover police officer has told BBC News that Scotland Yard kept intelligence files on MPs during the 1990s. Ex-Special Branch officer Peter Francis says he saw files on 10 Labour MPs which he and others regularly updated. He says he personally gathered information on three MPs as part of his work infiltrating left-wing groups. The MPs named, and Labour, have called for a forthcoming public inquiry into undercover policing to be widened. Mr Francis operated undercover between 1993 and 1997 in the Met's now disbanded Special Demonstration Squad. He was told to embed himself in left-wing groups or causes that were deemed to pose a potential threat to security. He says that during this period he was told to gather intelligence on MPs and their activities if and when they featured in any of his operations. That information, he says, was added to a special pink file that was available for Special Branch officers to read. Between 1990 and 2001, he claims to have personally seen records relating to Diane Abbott, the late Tony Benn, Jeremy Corbyn, the late Bernie Grant, Peter Hain, Harriet Harman, Ken Livingstone, Joan Ruddock, Dennis Skinner and Jack Straw.Four of the group became ministers during Mr Francis's time in Special Branch - including Jack Straw who was home secretary after 1997. ""When I was deployed undercover in the Special Demonstration Squad, any MP that I came across, such as on demonstrations, I would report back on them,"" he said. Mr Francis says that the files not only contained the MPs' publicly-stated political views - but also intelligence on what was going on behind the scenes in the party or their group. He says some of the information would have been things said in private by the MP, depending on how close each undercover officer had been able to get. Mr Francis said that when he first saw the files he understood that each had probably been created before the individual was an MP because of their personal involvement in radical causes or protests.But he added: ""When they became MPs these files carried on. It [was] your duty as an SDS officer to report back any intelligence that you come across. ""I felt that it was OK to report back on MPs,"" he said. ""I used to give myself a pat on the back, thinking 'I have done a good job'. These MPs were spied on and they should know.""""I don't think the police force should be monitoring MPs, full stop. I don't think we have any right to do that at all. It may be justifiable to say that the Security Service should be doing it - but I certainly don't think the police should be doing it.""Scotland Yard has refused to comment on the substance of the claims, but a spokesman said it had not shied away from serious allegations about the SDS. It said that Operation Herne, the internal police investigation into what happened in the unit, remained an ongoing investigation.""Operation Herne maintains that without speaking to Peter Francis it is simply not possible to fully investigate allegations he makes,"" said a spokesman. ""Operation Herne remains very willing to engage with him.""Mr Francis said that he has refused to speak to Operation Herne because he fears being interviewed under caution as a suspect, rather than a whistleblower. Scotland Yard told the BBC that Operation Herne detectives would be prepared to speak to him as a witness. He has, however, spoken to Mark Ellison QC who reviewed allegations about the SDS for the Home Secretary Theresa May - prompting her to launch a statutory inquiry. He says he will appear before those hearings. Peter Hain, who was a leader of the anti-apartheid movement in the late 1960s and 70s and became an MP in 1991, said he now wants full answers from Scotland Yard. ""I was deeply disturbed to find that files were still being kept by the Special Branch while I and others were serving Members of Parliament,"" he said. ""That is constitutionally an outrage. It infringes the sovereignty of Parliament. ""I want to see the home secretary widen the scope of the inquiry into the SDS to look specifically at the surveillance of MPs and the fact that there were active files on us while we were serving Members of Parliament. ""This should never have happened and it should have been reported and properly authorised - and we don't know whether it was.""Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper echoed the call for the inquiry to be widened in light of what she described as ""extremely serious and disturbing allegations"".""While undercover policing remains a crucial tool in combating serious and organised crime it must not be abused,"" she said.""There have now been a series of serious allegations about undercover policing - ranging from the treatment of Stephen Lawrence's family to police having long-term inappropriate relationships. ""We called some time ago for much stronger oversight of undercover policing and it is also vital to get to the truth about what has happened."" Mrs May announced earlier this month that Lord Justice Pitchford would lead the inquiry into the SDS allegations - but the precise shape of that inquiry is not yet clear.A Home Office spokesman said the review by Mark Ellison QC had unearthed ""serious historical failings"". ""That is why the Home Secretary established a public inquiry to thoroughly investigate undercover policing and the operation of the Special Demonstration Squad. ""Lord Justice Pitchford will consult interested parties to the inquiry over the coming months on setting the terms of reference, with a view to publishing these at the end of July.""Undercover policing is an essential tactic in the fight against crime but to improve the public's confidence in undercover work we must ensure there is no repeat of these failings in the future."""
2015-04-18,NHS problems worst 'since 1990s',https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/health-32057948,"Services in the NHS in England are deteriorating in a way not seen since the early 1990s, according to a leading health think tank. The King's Fund review said waiting times for A&E, cancer care and routine operations had all started getting worse, while deficits were growing.It said such drops in performance had not been seen for 20 years.But the think tank acknowledged the NHS had done as well as could be expected, given the financial climate.Professor John Appleby, chief economist at the King's Fund, which specialises in health care policy, said: ""The next government will inherit a health service that has run out of money and is operating at the very edge of its limits. ""There is now a real risk that patient care will deteriorate as service and financial pressures become overwhelming.""He said in terms of how standards were slipping - not how low they had reached - the situation was the worst it had been since the ""early 1990s"".The report noted much of the deterioration has happened in the second-half of the Parliament with many measures of performance being maintained in the first few years.It said the next government had to address the funding situation, adding the extra £8bn a year NHS England says is needed by 2020, was the ""minimum"" that would be required.The report - a review of performance this Parliament - highlights a range of problems as well as achievements. These include:The report is the second part of the King's Fund pre-election review of the NHS this Parliament.Last month it warned the coalition government's reforms of the health service had been ""damaging and distracting"".The King's Fund report should make worrying reading. The reference to the 1990s conjures up images of - for the NHS at least - a bygone era. The think tank's point was not that waiting times had reached the level they were at then, rather that this is the first time in two decades of almost continuous improvement that there has been a sustained drop in performance.In many ways, that had to happen. Services cannot keep getting better for ever. Nonetheless, the findings are crystal clear: the NHS is at a critical juncture. But what is less easy to determine is to what extent the coalition's policies have contributed to the difficulties.The think tank has already provided a critical analysis of the government's reforms - and when pushed, acknowledged the health service may have been ""in better shape"" if they had not happened.But the more significant issue for the health of the health service this Parliament has been the squeeze on finances. Even though the budget has been increased, it has felt more like a cut to many because demands have risen so quickly.On this though, the King's Fund accepted that the government's hands were tied. Given the state of the economy, ministers did as much as they could have.Read more from NickRoyal College of Nursing general secretary Peter Carter said politicians needed to take note of the warnings made by the King's Fund.""Morale is low, and more and more staff are being made sick with stress because of the intolerable pressure they are under,"" he added. Katherine Murphy, of the Patients Association, said: ""The findings echo what we are hearing on a daily basis on our helpline. It is clear to the public that the future of the NHS is one of the most important issues facing the nation and it should be a central issue in the election campaign.""Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham said: ""Five years ago David Cameron stood on a promise to protect the NHS. This report provides authoritative proof that he has broken that promise.""But a Department of Health spokesman said: ""As the King's Fund says, the NHS has 'performed well in the face of huge challenges', but if we are to continue to invest in the NHS going forward it needs to be backed by a strong economy.""

2015-04-18,SNP 'could block Tory government',https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32045419,"The SNP would block a minority Conservative government by voting down its Queen's Speech if it holds the post-election balance of power, its former leader Alex Salmond has said.Mr Salmond said the move could bring down the government if Labour joined in, with David Cameron ""locked out"".The Conservatives accused him of ""trying to sabotage the democratic will of the British people"".Labour has called his balance of power prediction ""bluster and bluff"".In recent days Mr Salmond, who is bidding to become a Westminster MP at the 7 May general election, has claimed his party could ""hold the power"" in a hung Parliament and would be able to influence the Budget of a minority Labour government.This was dismissed by Labour leader Ed Miliband, who has ruled out a formal coalition with the Scottish nationalists.The SNP currently has six MPs at Westminster, but recent opinion polls suggest its share could increase dramatically at the general election.James Cook, BBC News Scotland correspondentIf the Conservatives attempt to form a minority government and enough MPs vote against their Queen's Speech the administration would fall at the first hurdle and the leader of the opposition would have a shot at forming a government.That's how parliamentary democracy works in the event of a hung Parliament.And yet the Conservatives are saying that by planning to vote against a government he opposes Alex Salmond has ""confirmed he would sabotage the democratic will of the British people in order to make Ed Miliband prime minister"".It is part of their continuing attempt to portray Mr Miliband as a weak leader whose strings are being pulled by Mr Salmond.This kind of language causes despair among Tories north of the border who fear that the party in London is waltzing into an SNP trap.They know that many voters in Scotland will read the phrase ""democratic will of the British people"" and hear ""democratic will of the English people"".Because, if it is illegitimate for Scottish MPs, from whatever party, to vote against one government and support another in the British parliament, then what, voters may ask, is the point of the union?Who is dancing to Mr Salmond's tune now?Mr Salmond, the former Scottish first minister, told the New Statesman that in the event of a hung Parliament, a minority Conservative government would have to ""go straight effectively for a vote of confidence - usually the Queen's Speech, although it could be otherwise, of course - and we'd be voting against.""If David Cameron lost this vote, he said, there would be a two-week period for another government to be formed.BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said Mr Salmond had ""hardened his anti-Conservative rhetoric"" in the interview.A Conservative spokesman said:  ""Alex Salmond has confirmed he would sabotage the democratic will of the British people in order to make Ed Miliband prime minister. ""That would mean chaos for Britain, with weak Ed Miliband dancing to Alex Salmond's tune.""He said the ""only way to keep Britain together"" was to vote Conservative.Mr Salmond's latest comments come after Mr Miliband said the only people writing a future Labour Budget would be himself and shadow chancellor Ed Balls.Speaking in Clydebank on Monday, he added: ""It's not going to be Alex Salmond - not in a million years."""
2015-04-18,MPs criticise 'lack of EU debate',https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32045290,"The government's ""failure"" to let MPs debate EU legislation is ""deplorable"", a Parliamentary committee says.The European Scrutiny Committee said ministers had refused to schedule debates on issues such as free movement and the EU's Budget.It also said BBC coverage of EU matters should be ""improved substantially"".The government said the number of EU debates had doubled since 2009-10, while the BBC said its coverage was ""extensive and impartial"".The cross-party committee's role includes scrutinising EU documents and recommending the most important for debate in the House of Commons.Its report said in the period covering most of the 2014-15 financial year there were three debates on the floor of the House, compared with 12 in 2013-14.It also pointed out that not a single debate had taken place during a nine-month period, between 9 June 2014 and 9 March 2015.""The government's collective failure to schedule so many debates on EU documents over the past year is deplorable, and is a discourtesy to this committee and to all members of the House,"" the MPs said.Prime Minister David Cameron has sought to rally support from other EU leaders for his plans to curb welfare payments to European migrants ahead of a referendum on the UK's membership if he wins the general election.The committee said the government's ""cavalier"" approach was ""at odds with UK ministers' claims in their speeches across the EU about the role of national parliaments"".The Foreign Office said the government was committed to a ""strong EU scrutiny system that enables Parliament to hold it to account for the decisions taken in Brussels"".It added: ""We have made good on our commitment to raise standards by doubling the number of Europe debates on the floor of the House since 2009-10.""This government has also increased by around a fifth since 2010 the number of EU proposals that have been scrutinised and cleared by Parliament before being agreed in Brussels.""The committee has also been examining the BBC's coverage of European issues, taking evidence from director general Lord Hall and head of news James Harding earlier this month.During that appearance, Lord Hall said the desire for balanced output ""ran deep"" within the BBC and he believed that this was being achieved.Mr Harding said if the public was going to trust the BBC to report on politicians impartially it had to be clear that BBC journalists weren't ""asked by politicians to come and account for what they do and in effect do the bidding of those politicians"".But the committee said it was ""concerned about the manner in which the BBC treats EU issues"", calling for coverage to be ""improved substantially"".It suggested coverage did not reflect all sides of the debate on the European Union, and more analysis was needed. Its chairman, Conservative MP Sir William Cash, said the BBC had ""very particular obligations"" to be impartial and to ""educate and inform"".He added:  ""We do not believe this is currently being achieved in the context of the BBC's EU coverage.""A BBC spokesman said the corporation provided extensive and impartial coverage of European and Parliamentary issues, and it would be a breach of the corporation's independence if a committee of MPs instructed the BBC on its coverage."
2015-04-18,Lobbyists must 'conform' with rules,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32047992,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe woman in charge of the government's new register of lobbyists has said she expects the industry to ""conform"" with the statutory system. Speaking ahead of the register's launch, Alison White conceded a lot of lobbyists would not be listed on it.But she said her job was to make sure the rules were implemented and she would do so with ""extreme verve and vigour.""But one critic of the register said it was ""fake"" and full of ""loopholes"".Lobbyists are companies or individuals paid to influence government decisions.The coalition promised to introduce a statutory register of lobbyists when it came to power in 2010, and legislation was passed last year, with ministers saying the move would help clean up politics.However, the new register will only cover consultant lobbyists and will not apply to lobbyists working ""in-house"" for companies or organisations.A person or company will only need to be registered if they are contacting a government minister or permanent secretary in a government department - leading to criticism it will not come close to reflecting the scale or nature of lobbying that goes on across Whitehall.But Ms White, who is independent of the government, said her task was to implement the law as it stood not to question the powers she had been given. ""We are having something that has never been in place before,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""This is a statutory register. The industry tells me it is a professional industry. I expect them to conform with the legislation. It is my job to make sure they do so.""Ms White, who was appointed as the registrar of consultant lobbyists in September, acknowledged the register would not indicate different ""levels of lobbying"".""The legislation was quite narrowly drafted to address a particular issue, which was that it was not always particularly clear, when ministers were being lobbied, who the client of the lobbyist was. That is what the register was set up to do,"" she said.She added: ""This will give anyone who wishes to access the register the opportunity to be able to see who is lobbying and being paid for it and who their clients are. That is the main information the register will contain.""If a lobbyist sets out to influence government policy in some way, they would have to be registered. If they are not registered, then they would not be conforming. They have to go on the register before they lobby.""Ms White said last month that the register would not have any entries on its launch day but she had received more than ""20 expressions of interest"" about joining and companies and individuals might be required to sign up retrospectively.Potential registrants will be able to log on and create an account to file an ""information return"".But Tamasin Cave, from the Alliance for Lobbying Transparency coalition, said ""hardly anyone"" in the industry would be covered by the provisions of the new law. ""You have a huge commercial lobbying industry, and very few of them will have to sign up,"" she told Today.""The second flaw is that it won't show the interaction between lobbyists and government, and that is what a register is for.""It is to show the activity - who is discussing what with whom, but this shows nothing of this interaction. It is a fake register."""
2015-04-18,Car smoking ban MSP welcomes backing,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-south-scotland-32055226,"The Liberal Democrat MSP behind a bill to ban smoking in cars when children are present has welcomed the support of the Scottish government.South of Scotland MSP Jim Hume launched the members' bill in December.The government said it was ""very supportive"" of the principles of the bill, but changes could be needed to make it ""workable"".Motorists could potentially be fined £100 for breaching the rule if it becomes law.Mr Hume lodged draft proposals for a bill last May calling for a ban in Scotland on smoking in private vehicles when children under 18 were present.He said he was ""over the moon"" at the news the Scottish government would endorse the Smoking Prohibition (Children in Motor Vehicles) (Scotland) Bill.He said: ""With cross-party support and the support of many third sector organisations, there is every chance that this could be in place in the next year.""Eighty-four per cent of the 160 responses to my consultation were positive and people from across Scotland have expressed their support for the move.""The bill is about guaranteeing that children in Scotland can have the freedom to go on and lead healthy lives if they choose to.""I look forward to working with MSPs from all parties as the bill progresses.""Public Health Minister Maureen Watt said the Scottish government had considered including the measure in its Public Health Bill, but instead decided to support Mr Hume's proposals.She said: ""As with any bill, as it goes through the scrutiny process, there may be amendments and improvements to strengthen the legislation and ensure it is fit for purpose. ""But we believe that the underpinning principles are strong, and that is why I am pleased to support it.""Scottish Labour and a wide range of health organisations have backed his proposals.But the Scottish Conservatives have reservations about how the bill would work in practice.The party's health spokesman Jackson Carlaw said: ""While Scottish Conservatives support any moves which would protect young people from hazardous second hand smoke we have concerns as to how this would be enforced.""It would be a better use of resources to conduct a public awareness campaign similar to that which is being proposed by the government in Wales.""We will be watching this campaign in order to ascertain what lessons may be learned and what approaches may be adopted in Scotland.""Anti-smoking campaigners welcomed the Scottish government's backing for Mr Hume's bill.ASH Scotland's chief executive Sheila Duffy said: ""It is another public health initiative that can help Scotland move forward with its ambition to achieve a tobacco-free generation in 20 years' time.""It is popular with the public and will bring Scotland into line with upcoming legislation in England and Wales.""We believe it can be effectively enforced and that having the legislation focus on cars with children bypasses concerns over interference in people's private lives.""Jim Hume must be congratulated for taking the initiative on this proposal and for all the hard work he and his team have done to bring this important measure forward.""But Simon Clark, director of the smokers' group Forest, said the bill was ""legislation for legislation's sake"".He said: ""Smoking in cars carrying children is inconsiderate. The overwhelming majority of smokers know that and don't do it.""The very small number that do will carry on regardless because the law will be difficult, if not impossible, to enforce.""Education has to be better than legislation but the government prefers gesture politics and the big stick."""
2015-04-18,Candidate quits over UKIP MEP remark,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32038485,"A UKIP election candidate has quit the party over comments made by the party's only Scottish MEP about a Scottish government minister.Tim Wilson has decided not to stand in South Northamptonshire after David Coburn MEP compared Humza Yousaf to convicted terrorist Abu Hamza.Mr Coburn has apologised for the remarks, saying it was a ""joke"".A spokesman for UKIP said Mr Wilson had failed to emphasise local issues in his general election campaign.UKIP leader Nigel Farage said Mr Coburn's remarks were a ""joke in poor taste"" but he would not be taking any action against him.But Mr Wilson said he was disillusioned with the party over the ""racist jibes"" and has decided to stand down.He told BBC Scotland he was appalled by Mr Coburn's comments about Mr Yousaf and frustrated by the inaction of the party's leadership on the issue.  He said David Coburn had produced ""what I can only describe as an Islamaphobic insult, and that's simply not acceptable"".  Mr Wilson added: ""Of course he went on and apologised.  I think, frankly, that if you are in a position of power you have to be able to control what ideas emerge from your head and how they get to your mouth and, in fact, you shouldn't have those ideas in the first place.  ""But the real issue is that when Mr Farage was asked what he thought about this he dismissed this as a joke.  ""I don't think this is a joke. I think this is something very serious.  It may not be that this man intended to cause offence but we aren't interested in what his intentions are.  We are interested in the effect what he says has on other people and the effect is catastrophic, it's appalling and I've resigned.""In his resignation letter, Mr Wilson said he had been ""systematically gagged by the party whip"" and forbidden to speak about Islam favourably. A spokesman for UKIP said Mr Wilson had failed to put more emphasis on local issues in his campaign.He said: ""Whilst we had initially been optimistic about Tim Wilson's abilities as a candidate, it became obvious in recent weeks that he was out of his depth in representing our party in the way we would expect. ""Mr Wilson had clearly misunderstood the expectations that UKIP place on all of its candidates. Principal amongst those is focusing on issues that are relevant to local voters. UKIP put huge emphasis on local issues and Mr Wilson was unwilling to follow UKIP guidelines in this respect.""Last week MSPs at the Scottish Parliament unanimously condemned the remarks made by Mr Coburn during a newspaper interview.MSPs were debating a motion celebrating Scotland's diverse communities.The president of the European Parliament, Martin Schulz, condemned the remarks, saying they were ""not worthy of any elected member"". But a spokesman for the president said he could not act on remarks made outside parliament.The move comes just days after another candidate, Jonathan Stanley, quit in protest at the ""racist filth"" in UKIP. Mr Stanley, who was due to stand in the Cumbrian seat of Westmorland and Lonsdale, was the party's former head of policy in Scotland."

2015-04-18,Manifesto watch,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-29642613,"Political parties are putting together their manifestos for May's general election. Here's a guide to where they currently stand on the issues voters say they care about most (according to pollsters IPSOS Mori).ImmigrationConservatives:  David Cameron wants to make migrants wait four years before they can claim certain benefits, such as tax credits, Universal Credit, or get access to social housing. He wants to stop migrants from claiming child benefit for dependents living outside the UK, and remove those that have failed to find work after six months. Mr Cameron has promised to put reform of EU free movement rules at the heart of his renegotiation of Britain's relationship with the EU. He has ruled out a temporary cap on migrant numbers or an ""emergency brake"" on EU freedom of movement rules - ideas both mooted in recent months, saying this would be less ""effective"" than reducing the incentives for people to come to the UK. The party has a continuing goal to bring net immigration down to below 100,000 people a year (it currently stands at 243,000).Labour: ""Stronger"" border controls to tackle illegal immigration with ""proper"" entry and exit checks. ""Smarter"" targets to reduce low-skilled migration but ensure university students and high-skilled workers are not deterred. Employment agencies who only recruit abroad will be outlawed while the fines for employing illegal immigrants will be increased.Lib Dems: Reintroduce exit checks at borders, so the government can identify people who are overstaying their visa. Will require all new claimants for Jobseekers Allowance to have their English language skills assessed, with JSA then being conditional on attending language courses for those whose English is poor. Ensure that EU migrants have to ""earn"" their entitlement to benefits.SNP: Allow the devolved government to have control over immigration to Scotland, and introduce a Canadian-style earned citizenship system to attract highly-skilled immigrants.Plaid Cymru: Oppose a points-based system. Support the right of asylum seekers to work in Wales while they wait for status decisions to be made. Lobby the Westminster government to ensure that they shut ""detention"" centres.UKIP: Introduce an Australian-style points policy, used to select migrants with the skills and attributes needed to work in the country - covering people from inside and outside the EU. Bring net immigration down to 50,000 people a year. Priority lanes for UK passport holders. Increase UK border staff by 2,500. Tougher English language tests for migrants seeking permanent residence. Opt out of the Dublin treaty to allow the UK to return asylum seekers to other EU countries without considering their claim. Anyone who currently has the legal right to live, work, or study in the UK would not face deportation in the event of the country's withdrawal from the EU.Greens:  Progressively reduce UK immigration controls. Migrants illegally in the UK for over five years will be allowed to remain unless they pose a serious danger to public safety. More legal rights for asylum seekers.Taxes and the economyConservatives: Eradicate the deficit by 2018 and secure an overall budget surplus by 2019-20. Achieve this by spending cuts, not tax rises, while raising NHS spending. An income tax cut for 30 million people by 2020. Tax would start to kick in at £12,500 a year, instead of £10,500. This will cost £5.6bn. The higher tax rate, 40%, would start at £50,000 instead of £41,900, again by 2020, at a cost of £1.6bn. This will be paid for through £25bn in additional spending cuts and economic growth. No increases in VAT.Labour: Get the current budget into surplus and the national debt falling ""as soon as possible in the next parliament"". No additional borrowing for new spending. Reintroduce the 50p top rate of income tax for earnings over £150,000.  Cut income tax for 24 million people by bringing back the 10p rate, paid for by scrapping the Married Couples' Tax Allowance. Bring in a ""mansion tax"" on properties worth over £2m, to raise £1.2bn. A tax on bankers' bonuses. A 5% pay cut for every government minister. Push for UK overseas territories to be put on an international blacklist if they refuse to co-operate with a drive against tax avoidance. No increases in VAT or National Insurance contributions.Lib Dems: Raise the personal allowance - the point at which you start paying income tax - to £11,000 in April 2016 and then to £12,500 by 2020. ""Strict new fiscal rules"" to ensure the deficit has gone by April 2018, with the wealthy contributing the most. The Lib Dems invented the ""mansion tax"" but in contrast to Labour have set out how it would operate - along similar lines to council tax bands. There are also Lib Dem plans to increase capital gains tax - paid on profits from second homes or shares - from 28% to 35%. Impose an additional 8% rate of corporation tax on UK banks to raise an extra £1bn a year to help pay off the deficit.SNP: Oppose UK plans in the Infrastructure Bill which will allow oil and gas drilling and hydraulic fracturing beneath people's homes without consent. Invest in offshore wind farming. Support an international bank tax and limits to industry bonuses.Plaid Cymru: Build a Green Skills Construction College, specialising in green energy. Establish a publicly-owned energy company. Establish a publicly-owned Bank of Wales business investment bank. Enforce a living wage. Give devolved nations an equal say in institutions that affect everyone's lives, such as the Bank of England.UKIP: Increase the personal allowance to the level of full-time minimum wage earnings, about £13,500, by 2020. Abolish inheritance tax. Introduce a 35% income tax rate between £42,285 and £55,000, at which point the 40% rate becomes payable. Set up a Treasury Commission to design a turnover tax on large businesses. Cut foreign aid budget by £9bn a year. Scrap HS2. Save £8bn a year in membership fees by leaving the EU.  Lower the VAT rate charged on restorations to listed buildings.Greens: People earning more than £100,000 a year would pay 50% income tax. Wealth tax of 1% to 2% on people worth £3m or more. Renationalise the railways and energy companies. Scrap HS2. Allow councils to impose extra business rates on out-of-town supermarkets to fund small local businesses. Crackdown on tax avoidance by multinationals. Allow ""the current dependence on economic growth to cease, and allow zero or negative growth to be feasible without individual hardship"". Commit Britain to a ""zero carbon"" future. Cut rail and bus fares by an average of 10%. Enforce a cap on bankers' bonuses.The NHSConservatives:  Chancellor George Osborne says he will put an extra £2bn into frontline health services across the UK, which he described as a ""down payment"" on a plan drawn up by NHS bosses calling for an extra £8bn a year above inflation by 2020. In England, everyone would be able to see a GP seven days a week by 2020. Recruit 5,000 more doctors.Labour:  Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said Labour would commit an extra £2.5bn a year above Mr Osborne's plan. The money will come from three sources - a new ""mansion"" tax, clamping down on tax avoidance by big corporations and a new tax on tobacco companies. Patients in England would get a GP appointment within 48 hours and would not have to wait longer than a week for cancer tests and results. Scrap the Health and Social Care Act and end ""creeping privatisation"" of the NHS.  Integrate health and social care services into a system of ""whole-person care"". Give greater priority to mental health services. Replace the Cancer Drugs Fund in England when it runs out in 2016 with a £330m fund to improve access to innovative cancer drugs, surgery and radiotherapy. Recruit 5,000 more healthcare workers to help patients stay in their homes and introduce new safety checks to identify people at risk of hospitalisation. Prioritise child mental health by increasing the proportion of the mental health budget spent on children.Lib Dems: An extra £1bn for the NHS every year, to be funded by - amongst other things - making higher earners pay more tax on their shares. Half of this will go towards mental health. Ensure that spending on the NHS rises in line with growth in the economy. People who need therapy for conditions such as depression will be guaranteed treatment within 18 weeks. For young patients experiencing psychosis for the first time treatment will be provided within two weeks of being referred by a GP. This is all going to happen from April, with more mental health targets to follow if the Lib Dems return to government. Wants a cross-party review of the future of NHS funding.SNP: Reduce the number of senior managers in the NHS by 25% over the next parliament. Streamline the work of health boards. Real terms increases in year-on-year NHS spending.Plaid Cymru: Recruit 1,000 extra doctors to the Welsh NHS over two terms of a Plaid government. Offer financial incentives for recruiting doctors to areas and specialisms where there are, or are predicted to be, shortages. Encourage innovation and attract more research funding, in part by increasing research and development funding as government finance allows. Improve training for postgraduate doctors and stop them being used to ""plug gaps"" in staff rotas. More recruitment from within the EU to fill vacancies and using international doctors to staff the NHS while a new generation of Welsh doctors are trained.UKIP: An extra £3bn per year in NHS funding paid for by quitting the EU and through ""middle management"" cuts. Keep NHS free at the point of delivery. Stop any further use of PFI, and encourage local authorities to buy out their PFI contracts early where it is affordable to do so. Ensure all visitors and migrants who have been here for fewer than five years have NHS-approved medical insurance as a condition of entry to UK, with £200m of the £2bn saved to be spent on ending hospital parking charges in England. Bring back state-enrolled nurses and return powers to matrons. Monitor and Care Quality Commission to be replaced with elected county health boards. Stop spending £90m a year on gastric band and breast enhancement operations.Greens: Funding to be diverted away from centralised facilities towards community healthcare, illness prevention and health promotion.  Stop privatisation. Abolish prescription charges. Dedicated NHS Tax to go direct to the health service. Ban proactive recruitment of non-British NHS staff from overseas. A complete ban on the promotion of tobacco and alcohol products, including sponsorship.Security, defence and foreign affairsConservatives: Hold a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU by 2017, after negotiating the return of some powers from Brussels. Protect foreign aid budget. Replace Trident.Labour:  Push for reform of European Union and prevent Britain from ""sleepwalking"" towards exit. Commit in law to holding a Strategic Defence and Security Review every 5 years. Outlaw discrimination and abuse of Armed Forces personnel.Lib Dems: Campaign to reduce the number of Trident nuclear submarines. Push for greater European Union efficiency. SNP: Oppose nuclear weapons and push for removal of Trident submarines from Scotland. In 2010, proposed a Scottish Centre for Reconciliation and Conflict Resolution, to promote peaceful alternatives to armed conflict. Maintain 0.7% commitment to foreign aid. Enhanced role for Scotland within the UK in Europe, particularly in fisheries policy.Plaid Cymru: Honour commitment of 0.7% of budget used for foreign aid. Campaign for cancellation of developing countries' debts. Support the Fair Trade movement. Support the 'Tobin' or 'Robin hood' tax as a means of encouraging more responsibility and stability in the global markets. Reform the IMF and World Bank in order to improve regulation and accountability. Continue membership of the EU, but campaign for democratic reform. Support minority nations and minority language speakers around the world. Pass a Military Wellbeing Act to promote and safeguard the physical and mental health and wellbeing of military personnel.UKIP:  Leave the European Union. Remove the passports of any person who has gone to fight for a terrorist organisation and deport anyone who has committed a terrorist act. Cut foreign aid budget by £9bn. Create a Veterans Department to look after the interests of ex-service men and women.Greens: Referendum on Britain's EU membership. Want reform of EU to hand powers back to local communities. Boost overseas aid to 1% of GDP within 10 years. Scrap Britain's nuclear weapons. Take the UK out of NATO unilaterally. End the so-called ""special relationship"" between the UK and the US.  Stop EU-US free trade deal TTIP. JobsConservatives: Create three million apprenticeships to be paid for by benefit cuts.Labour: Guarantee a job for under 25s unemployed for over a year and adults unemployed for more than two years. As many young people to go on an apprenticeship as currently go to university by 2025. Create a million new high technology, green jobs by 2025. Ban ""exploitative"" zero hour contracts.Lib Dems: An extra £1 an hour for the lowest paid apprentices. Campaign to create a million more jobs.SNP: Introduce gender quotas on public boards. Living wage ""a central priority"" in all Scottish government contracts. Continue the 'small business bonus'.Plaid Cymru: Provide rates relief for small businesses. Increase the number and value of contracts from Welsh public bodies that go to firms within Wales.UKIP: Allow firms to offer jobs to British workers first ""without the fear of being sued for discrimination"".Greens: A national energy conservation scheme to create thousands of new jobs. The party wants to create ""sustainable jobs"" and promotes more local production of food and goods.Education Conservatives: Protect England's schools budget - from reception entry at age four or five to the end of GCSEs at 16 - in cash terms although funding per pupil will not keep pace with inflation. Pre-school and post 16 education not ring fenced. Convert up to 3,500 more schools judged by Ofsted to ""require improvement"" into academies. ""War on illiteracy and innumeracy"". State primary schools in England that repeatedly failed to have a proportion of year-six pupil pass times tables and writing tests be forced to become academies, or have sponsorship replaced if already an academy. Opposed to giving votes to 16 and 17-year-olds for UK-wide general elections and local elections in England.Labour:  Increase the overall education budget in England, including schools, nurseries, Sure Start and provision for 16-to 18-year-olds, by at least the rate of inflation, although per-pupil funding is not specifically protected, meaning some of the increase will be eaten up by rising pupil numbers. Parents of primary school children would be guaranteed childcare from 8am to 6pm. The amount of free childcare for three and four year olds would be increased from 15 to 25 hours a week. Compulsory sex and relationship education in all schools. Refuse to grant business rate relief to independent schools unless they can show a ""meaningful impact"" on state schools through a new School Partnership Standard, for example by lending teaching staff or assisting in university admissions procedures. Committed to extending the franchise to 16 and 17-year-olds in elections across the UK. Double the number of Sure Start childcare places to more than 118,000. Tighten up the rules on primary school class sizes to ensure they do not have more than 30 pupils.Lib Dems: Protect the education budget from cuts. Guarantee qualified teachers and a core curriculum set by independent experts, as well as compulsory sex education, in all state schools including academies and free schools. More money for disadvantaged school children and free childcare for all two year olds. A two-thirds discount on all local bus fares for young people aged 16-21. Supports lowering the voting age to 16 in all UK elections.SNP: Guaranteed free 30 hours of childcare a week for three and four-year-olds in Scotland, up from 16 hours. Maintain lack of tuition fees at Scottish universities, and offer financial support in grants and loans to students. Continue to build and refurbish schools. Lower voting age to 16 in all UK elections.Plaid Cymru: Introduce a compulsory modern foreign language GCSE in secondary schools and the teaching of modern foreign languages in primary schools. Look at ways to strengthen the teaching of Welsh history and culture. Oppose foundation schools, academies and free schools. Look at moving from a per-pupil funding mechanism to a funding model based on the catchment area. Will not support any further increases in tuition fees for higher education students, and will seek the abolition of tuition fees as and when public finances allow. Supports lowering the voting age to 16 for elections to the Welsh Assembly and the UK Parliament.UKIP: More grammar schools. Scrap sex education for children aged under seven. Scrap tuition fees for students from poorer backgrounds who take degree courses in the sciences, technology, maths or engineering. Greater emphasis on vocational education with new Apprenticeship Qualification Option. School governing boards must be made up of at least 30% parents of children at the school. Allow universities to charge same amount for EU students as non-EU students.Greens: End performance related pay for teachers. Replace Ofsted with an independent National Council for Educational Excellence. Bring Free Schools and Academies into local authority control.

Withdraw Jobseeker's Allowance from young people after six months unless they take part in ""community projects"". And 18 to 21-year-olds wouldn't be entitled to housing benefit. Ban on zero-hours contracts which stop people getting work elsewhere. Raise the personal allowance - the point at which you start paying income tax - to £11,000 in April 2016 and then to £12,500 by 2020, which means that if you work on minimum wage for 30 hours you will pay no income tax. Young people out of work, education or training for six months will have to do unpaid community work to get benefits. This will apply to about 50,000 18 to 21-year-olds. Universal benefits for pensioners, such as free bus passes, TV licences for the over 75s and the winter fuel allowance. will once again be protected. Labour: Freeze energy prices until 2017. Increase in the minimum wage from £6.50-an-hour to £8-an-hour by 2020. Rises in child benefit capped at 1% for the first two years of the next parliament. Winter fuel allowance would be withdrawn from the wealthiest pensioners. Repeal what the government calls the spare room subsidy, dubbed the ""bedroom tax"" by Labour.  A million interest-free loans to help people insulate their homes. Rail fares would be capped. Double the amount of paid paternity leave available to new fathers from two to four weeks, and increase statutory paternity pay to £260 a week.Lib Dems: Raise the personal allowance - the point at which you start paying income tax - to £11,000 in April 2016 and then to £12,500 by 2020 (the Conservatives are promising the same thing). Nick Clegg has said he would not accept Conservative plans to freeze working-age benefits without taxing the rich too. He hasn't said he would block welfare cuts altogether. Withdraw eligibility for the Winter Fuel Payment and free TV Licence from pensioners on the 40% rate of income tax. A ""yellow card"" system to deal with benefit claimants breaking the rules, rather than imposing sanctions without warning.SNP: Oppose cuts to in-work benefits. Support moves to extend paternity leave. Introduce a maximum combined withdrawal rate for benefits and reforms to employment support allowance and cold weather payments. Protect policies such as concessionary travel for older Scots.Plaid Cymru: Move away from complex and expensive means testing for child-related benefits. Continue to campaign for the introduction of a living pension during the period of the next parliament for those aged 80 and over. UKIP: Only pay child benefit for the first two children for new claimants. Increase the Carers' Allowance to the same level as Jobseekers' Allowance (JSA) and pay a higher rate of JSA if you've been in work and already made tax and National Insurance contributions. Prevent anyone taking up permanent residence in Britain unless they're able to support themselves and any dependents they bring with them for at least five years and stop them receiving benefits. Stop paying child benefit for children who don't live in Britain. Scrap what UKIP calls the ""detested bedroom tax"". Boost ""credit unions"".Greens: The party backs a Citizen's Income, a fixed amount of £72 income a week to be paid to every individual, whether they are in work or not, to be funded by higher taxes on the better off and green levies.  But in the short-term it would increase the minimum wage to £10 by 2020. Ban zero hours contracts. Axe the ""bedroom tax"". Abolish the work capability assessment and restore the level of the former disability living allowance. Scrap the government's welfare cap, which limits the maximum amount a household can claim annually to £26,000 a year."

2015-04-18,Elephant trap?,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32047998,"The campaign has not even got under way, yet in the space of a couple of hours we have now been treated to not only one election pledge, but to two. The prime minister ruled out raising VAT if re-elected - while Labour said National Insurance contributions wouldn't go up.Usually politicians fudge the question of tax rises.  When he was leader of the opposition David Cameron himself said ""we have no need to raise taxes"" - before hiking up VAT after polling day.Famously, John Major said he had ""no plans"" to put up the sales tax -  before his chancellor did just that.And when he appeared in front of the cross-party Treasury committee of MPs on Tuesday, the current chancellor seemed to be continuing that tradition.  Under repeated questioning, George Osborne said: ""The policies we have do not involve a VAT rise.""That formulation appeared to give him not so much wriggle room, but an entire wriggle mansion.Labour assumed their campaign warning of further VAT rises to come under the Tories was very much on the money.But George Osborne's allies are suggesting privately that he had, in fact, been walking Ed Miliband to the edge of an elephant trap, then beckoning the prime minister to push the opposition leader in.Ed Miliband's strategists fully expected Mr Cameron to repeat the chancellor's obfuscation on tax at the final Prime Minister's Questions of this Parliament. They would then have expanded on the theme, inviting the prime minister to answer other difficult questions - then say he wasn't being straight with the British people for avoiding them.But the Labour leader was completely wrong-footed when first the prime minister said he would rule out a VAT rise and then counter-punched, inquiring if Labour would now rule out an increase in National Insurance contributions.Ed Miliband dodged the question and what could have been downbeat Conservative benches, uneasy over the prime minister's announcement this week of his retirement plans, were given something to cheer.The reason Ed Miliband didn't respond is because he was holding the National Insurance pledge back for Labour's manifesto.But that soon became unsustainable - so the other Ed, the shadow chancellor Ed Balls, had to undertake a hasty round of the TV studios to do just that.When I spoke to him mid-tour, he put on a brave face. His view was that George Osborne, having raised VAT from 17.5% to 20%, wanted to give the issue a low profile - whereas the prime minister had now made the mistake of putting it centre stage. And he believed David Cameron's promise would be judged against his past VAT-raising performance.He defended Ed Miliband's reluctance to talk about National Insurance as he felt it would have been ""inappropriate"" to announce Labour tax policy at PMQs.So the prime minister - always a better tactician than strategist - can at least satisfy himself that he smoked Labour out on NI and disrupted at least one entry in their election campaign grid.But the exchange actually raised more questions than it answered.If the main parties are ruling out further potential sources of revenue, but still committing themselves to eradicating a £90bn black hole in the public finances, will they now be under more pressure during the election campaign to spell out in much greater detail exactly what they intend to cut?"
2015-04-18,Who's next?,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32031343,"David Cameron's declaration that he will not seek a third term in office if he retains power in May has immediately stoked interest in who might fill his shoes when he's gone. Here are the likely - and perhaps less obvious - possibilities.Claim? As chancellor of the exchequer he's the man in charge of the purse strings and master strategist - and reportedly the PM's favourite to succeed him, although he hasn't said as much. Mr Cameron's right-hand man has had an image makeover of late, with a new haircut and a diet to shed some pounds. And he has seemingly recovered from his ""omnishambles"" Budget in 2012, with his latest - and last Budget - of the parliament giving the Tories a lead in some polls. He's said to be well liked among Conservative cabinet ministers and backbench MPs, whose support is vital for any candidate wanting to take on the party leadership. He shas some work to do among grassroots Tory members, however, coming fifth in ConservativeHome's latest online poll of party members on future leaders.Latest odds: 10/1 (according to William Hill)What's he said? ""The prime minister leads a strong team but what you see from him is answering a direct question with a direct answer. I think that's really refreshing. He says he's going to serve that full five years so the real question facing the country now is do you want the strong leadership of David Cameron that's delivering zero inflation and record jobs or do you want the chaos and incompetence of Ed Miliband.""Claim? The longest-serving home secretary in 50 years, she is only the second Conservative woman to secure one of the top four jobs in government. In her role, she has talked tough on immigration and crime and taken on the Police Federation. And she is popular with Tory activists, consistently occupying either first or second place in ConservativeHome's online polls on future party leaders. There have long been claims of Mrs May positioning herself for the top job, with reported tensions between her and the prime minister. Critics say she lacks charisma and micro-manages - while some cannot forget her coining the now infamous ""nasty party"" phrase at a Tory conference in 2002, but supporters say she is a formidable operator, and have dubbed her Britain's Angela Merkel. Latest odds: 9/2What's she said? ""My view is very simple, David Cameron is a first class leader of the party and a first class prime minister and I hope he is going to be doing that for a very long time."" (Desert Island discs, 23 November 2014)Claim? The blonde bombshell and mayor of London who can seemingly reach voters that others in the party cannot. Casting aside a rather chequered past he steered the capital through the 2012 Olympics, launched the successful and popular ""Boris bikes"" and got rid of London's ""bendy buses"" in favour of the new Routemaster double deckers. Mr Johnson hopes to revive his Westminster parliamentary career at the general election. He has been tipped by many to take the helm of the Conservative Party, and has not discouraged the idea. Like Theresa May, he is also a favourite among the grassroots of the party, pipping her to the top spot in ConservativeHome's latest poll of party members on future leaders. (he's ahead by 2 points). Critics say the gaffe-prone politician is not the right man for the job, but his supporters point to his wide-spread appeal.Latest odds: 9/4What's he said? ""I think what David Cameron is saying is banal and obvious. There has already been a leader of the Conservative Party for ten years and he's done an outstanding job. What he's saying now is that he wants to serve through to 2020 and that is frankly what we need him to do... five more years is what this country needs. I'm not entirely certain I see what the story is. He was asked a straight question, are you going to serve a third term like Mrs Thatcher or Tony Blair and he said no, because he thinks that ten years on top of British politics is an incredibly long time.""Claim? A self-made millionaire and devotee of Margaret Thatcher, he is regarded as one of the Conservatives' fastest-rising stars. The Treasury minister-turned-culture secretary became the first of the 2010 intake of MPs to reach cabinet level, and the first Asian male Conservative cabinet minister. He's currently polling well among the Conservative grassroots, who voted him third most preferable leader in ConservativeHome's latest online future leader poll. David Cameron recently said he wants to see a British Asian prime minister in his lifetime.Latest odds: 12/1Claim? Currently holding one of the four great offices of state - foreign secretary - Mr Hammond's name has often cropped up whenever talk of leadership contenders has emerged. He has built up an impressive CV in government since the Conservatives came to power in 2010, being first awarded the job of transport secretary before his promotion to defence secretary where he stayed for three years. He's regarded by many commentators as being a potential candidate for the Tory right. He seems to have work to do among party activists, scoring only 4% in ConservativeHome's future leader poll.Latest odds: 12/1"
2015-04-18,Cereal number,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-magazine-monitor-31962592,"David Cameron has declared he won't seek a third term as prime minister, citing an advertising slogan for Shredded Wheat used in the UK more than 30 years ago. What's its enduring power, asks Justin Parkinson.The hotel kitchen staff are in disbelief. Someone in room 147 has ordered three Shredded Wheat. The maid transports them upstairs to find England cricketer Ian Botham waiting at a table, dressed in full whites.The maid leaves. Botham hides one of the Shredded Wheat under a napkin and winks to camera. Cue music, as the slogan ""Shredded Wheat. Bet you can't eat three"" appears.This advert and others featuring football manager Brian Clough and the actor Richard Kiel, who played Jaws in James Bond films, have not run for some time. Nestle, which owns the brand, says the last probably aired in 1984.But their message seems to have waned little. Telling the BBC he would only serve a limited time in Downing Street, David Cameron said: ""Terms are like Shredded Wheat - two are wonderful but three might just be too many.""The prime minister's reprise was unlikely to be accidental, says Thayne Forbes, joint managing director of the brand-valuation company Intangible Business. ""Everybody would empathise with the view that three Shredded Wheat would probably be too much,"" he says. ""The slogan suggests people shouldn't overdo it. It sounds modest and reasoned.""As marketing goes, it might seem counter-intuitive, as it discourages excessive consumption. But it also sounds honest and unexploitative.Other advertising slogans and themes are in wide use in public and political discourse. Examples include Marmite being a by-word for divisiveness - a ""Marmite person"" is either loved or hated. Cameron has twice referred to Ronseal - the woodcare product that does ""exactly what it says on the tin"". But Shredded Wheat, its best-known slogan having lain dormant for so long, appears to be used less often. The cereal, created in the US in the 1890s, has long been sold as good for the evolving British lifestyle. A newspaper advert in 1902 described it as ""a relief from the monotony of everlasting porridge"", while, by 1943, it was ""an ideal food for all war workers"". The 1980s saw an emphasis on ""simple, honest goodness"", while, in the 2000s, its long heritage and reliability was promoted.""It's a good association for Cameron,"" says Forbes. ""He must have been brought up on it, like lots of other people. It will be great marketing for Shredded Wheat to have the slogan used after so many years, too.""Subscribe to the BBC News Magazine's email newsletter to get articles sent to your inbox"
2015-04-18,Are you 'cosmopolitan'?,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32021853,"The rise of UKIP heralds the emergence of a new divide in British politics, with cosmopolitan voters on one side and non-cosmopolitan ones on the other, argues Jeremy Cliffe.We hear a lot about UKIP these days. The party stole the show at the local and European elections last year, then again in the autumn when it lured two Conservative MPs to defect.  In the past weeks alone there have been three much-discussed television programmes about the party: ""Meet the Ukippers"", ""Farage Fans and UKIP Lovers"" and ""100 Days of UKIP"". At the upcoming general election the party will probably increase its share of seats in Westminster - and will certainly affect the results in dozens of other constituencies by taking votes from the other parties. But ask some of those academics who have been watching UKIP's rise, and they will tell you that it is just one part of a bigger story. We are all used to the left-right divide in politics: a spectrum of different views on how much the government should tax, spend, regulate and otherwise intervene in the economy. But according to Dr Rob Ford of Manchester University, UKIP exists on a different axis, one to do with cultural rather than economic matters. This new political scale is ever more prominent in British political life.Radio 4's Analysis programmeOn the one end of it is what you might call a ""cosmopolitan"" philosophy: a relaxed, liberal attitude to issues concerning national identity (like immigration) and to questions of morality and lifestyle (like gay marriage). On the other end is a ""non-cosmopolitan"" outlook: more nationalist, socially conservative and less comfortable with social change, or in other words the ideological stance often associated with typical UKIP voters. This divide cuts across the left-right scale: there are cosmopolitan and non-cosmopolitan voters in both the Conservative and the Labour camps, which is why UKIP takes support from both.Lots of things are making this cosmopolitanism divide more important. One is that the old class-based, ideological conflict between left and right has declined. Dr James Tilley of Oxford University argues that politicians are partly to blame. The economic philosophies of the Conservative and Labour parties are so similar, he argues, that other, cultural issues are becoming more important. Another factor is the growing gap between the generations: the difference in outlook between the cosmopolitan young and less cosmopolitan, older voters is greater than it was in the past (partly due to the recent rise in levels of university education, which tend to correlate with liberal views). This trend presents the established parties with some difficult questions. As Dr Ford puts it, they ""have to try and deal with this rising value divide, particularly now that UKIP has mobilised it into the political debate."" ""They have to make a move,"" he adds, ""but any move that they make risks making their position worse with one or the other of these groups of voters."" Sound too cosmopolitan, and the parties risk losing supporters to UKIP. Try to ""out-UKIP UKIP"", and they could alienate their younger, more socially liberal supporters. So both are doing the political splits, trying to reconcile the cosmopolitans within their ranks with the non-cosmopolitans. Witness the tortuous attempts by Ed Miliband to sound tough on immigration without sounding too tough. Witness, too, the recent struggles of David Cameron to persuade social conservatives in his party that gay marriage can be an innately conservative institution. In the long-term, this divide will become less problematic. That is because over the years the country will tilt towards the cosmopolitan end of this new spectrum. So says Penny Young of NatCen, the research organisation that conducts the extensive British Social Attitudes survey. Various demographic factors explain this trend. The country as a whole is becoming more accepting of same-sex relationships. Younger voters are more relaxed about things like immigration and national identity than were previous generations when they were young, suggesting that the overall population will tilt in an internationalist direction over time. And ever more parts of the country are acquiring the ethnic and social diversity once confined to the inner cities, a trend that generally makes people more comfortable with immigration. According to Dr Ford the question is therefore: how should the main political parties navigate this period of transition? It would be wrong to simply abandon the swathes of voters at the less cosmopolitan end of the scale; voters who are usually older and more isolated than the average member of the population.Yet the politicians do need to adapt to the changing attitudes of British society and be honest with voters rather than pandering to views that, deep down, they do not share. This quandary may not decide the upcoming general election, but in the established parties savvy strategists with an eye to elections in 2020 and beyond are grappling with it nonetheless. That is a wise move."
2015-04-18,Dudley debate,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32015334,"I met Afzal Amin for the first time on Friday, but I already knew who he was. In Dudley North, the seat he was selected by the Conservatives to fight in the general election, Mr Amin had become hard to avoid. When I first looked at the local newspaper online, the pages were surrounded by ""Amin"" logos in the preferred Tory shade of blue.Not long after we met, he asked me to pose for a photo, snapped by one of his campaign team, and doubtless rapidly tweeted out to followers of the would-be MP.Perhaps no surprise that the man running such a disciplined operation has served in the army and been to Sandhurst. That was very much the message he delivered on Friday, as he addressed school and college pupils at a hustings in Dudley which I'd been invited to chair.There was combative debate, too, not least with his Labour rival, the MP Ian Austin. Both men knew the Dudley contest was critical for their respective parties; Ian Austin held the seat by just over 600 votes in 2010. Just as David Cameron was denied a majority by failing to take seats like this one, so Ed Miliband is unlikely to be in No 10 if Labour loses Dudley North.He was self-confident and fluent. The only obvious mis-step came right at the end, when he interrupted Vicky Duckworth, the Green candidate for the neighbouring seat. She expressed the opinion that politics often seemed to be about men shouting at each other; Mr Amin complained she was engaging in gender bias.A few weeks ago, one Conservative MP who knows him well and respects his talents, said Afzal Amin had warned him of the risks of over-confidence. He thought he risked running before he could walk.Well, he stumbled badly this weekend. Whatever the purpose of his contacts with the English Defence League - and he strongly disputes claims that he wanted them to hold a protest that would then be called off, for which he could then take the credit - the exposure has damaged him and, potentially, the prospects of his party re-taking the seat.In February, the EDL staged a rally against plans for a new mosque in the town. As the Mail on Sunday story makes clear, Afzal Amin pleaded with them beforehand not to hold that demonstration; but it went ahead anyway. It's what happened subsequently which will feature in Tuesday's disciplinary hearing.Over the weekend, I put his defence to a very senior Conservative source - that this was an attempt to broker a compromise in order to bring together a divided community. The arch response: Dudley isn't Kandahar.Nor do I think from my visits to the town, where I'm going to be based for the general election, will people in Dudley appreciate being painted as somewhere riven by racial discord.True, Dudley was the scene of one of England's earliest race riots. But that was in 1962. Although the controversy over replacing the mosque - currently in a converted school and inadequate for the numbers who want to worship there - has been running for a decade, community relations are generally good. Even those who don't want a new mosque didn't want the EDL protestors - nor to be fair the anti-fascist counter-demonstrators who followed them.As for the Conservative Party, the view of the national leadership is that you don't collaborate with the EDL. Not least because the Tories are still struggling to bury some historic baggage in the Black Country: Enoch Powell was an MP in Wolverhampton when he delivered his Rivers of Blood speech about immigration in 1968.Four years before that, there was the notorious election in Smethwick which the Conservatives were accused of winning by wooing white voters with an offensive rhyme suggesting who'd they'd get as a neighbour if they voted Labour. Afzal Amin grew up in Smethwick so he should be aware of that history. He was, until his suspension on Saturday, one of about 17% of Conservative parliamentary candidates who are not white. The party is proud of that, but it's still struggling to translate that into votes.Afzal Amin may believe that he can persuade the party to lift the suspension when he meets party officials on Tuesday. I have my doubts. Even if they accept his defence, will the other parties be so charitable? The allegations would follow him on the campaign trail, and make planned visits by cabinet ministers next to impossible.On Friday, just before the hustings in Dudley began, Afzal Amin gave me his business card. It introduces him as 'prospective member of Parliament Dudley North'. I think I'll keep it; it could yet become a collector's item."

2015-04-19,Bid to change Speaker election rules,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32061097,"A last-minute bid to change the way the Speaker of the House of Commons is elected is to be debated by MPs.Labour criticised the government motion, to be debated on the final day before the dissolution of Parliament, saying the Conservatives were ""trying to play politics with the speakership"".Under the proposals, a secret ballot would decide whether there should be a contested election for the post.MPs currently have to file through the division lobbies to cast their vote.This means it is clear who does or does not back the incumbent as Speaker.Labour's shadow leader of the Commons Angela Eagle raised the party's concerns in the House on Wednesday evening, questioning whether the motion was within parliamentary rules.Current Speaker John Bercow is - technically - one of them, but many Tory MPs have never liked him.They resent his personal style and some believe he is far from impartial in the way he conducts business in the Commons.Attempts by some to force a vote on his resumption as Speaker in 2010 came to nothing. There have been the occasional measured jibes at him from the prime minister. Other Tories reportedly went much further and formed a group whose members had all been reprimanded by him. But the Speaker is a reformer who believes passionately that the people who elect the members, and pay the bills, should come first.The last act of the coalition looks like being an attempt to unseat him. And they are very serious about it.One Tory MP fighting an important marginal seat had been cleared by his party to be away from Parliament but he is now staying for the vote, such is the importance of it.She told Deputy Speaker Lindsay Hoyle: ""It's just come to my attention that the government has tabled a motion for debate on the final day of this Parliament, with no notice whatsoever to myself as shadow leader of the House, proposing changes to the way in which the Speaker of this House is elected.""Procedural matters in this House, with no consultation with the opposition, no consultation with the chair of the committee itself, for debate in only one hour tomorrow.""Mr Hoyle said the motion had been ""rightly or wrongly"" agreed to on Tuesday, saying that ""business of the House is decided by the government, not by the chair.""A spokesman for Commons Leader William Hague said the motion had been tabled as a free hour had opened up in Thursday's business after the House of Lords approved the Modern Slavery Bill.The proposed change would apply when a Speaker wishes to continue in the post after a general election.Under the current rules, if the Speaker's re-appointment is objected to, a division is held, with MPs choosing to back or oppose the Speaker in the division lobbies.The replacement of this method with a secret ballot was suggested in 2010 by a committee of MPs, which said the public method ""can be seen as a deterrent to the House expressing its views honestly"".MPs will now debate whether this change should be made."

2015-04-19,MPs warn on growth of UK jihadists,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32059813,"Not enough is being done to prevent people leaving the UK to join Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, a group of MPs has warned.Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said Britain must win their ""hearts and minds"".The committee's report comes as the BBC launches a database tracking British jihadists in Syria and Iraq. It shows that many people left in clusters from certain UK areas - often due to friendships and peer groups. The MPs' report argued that preventative work with communities, families and international partners was ""vital"" and needs to be a top priority for the Home Office.  ""The number of cases being brought to public attention should ring alarm bells,"" said Labour MP Mr Vaz.  ""This must be a relentless battle for hearts and minds, and without a strong counter-narrative we are in danger of failing to prevent even more departures. We are at the edge of a cliff."" The BBC has been tracking the stories of the men, women, boys and girls who have gone to Syria and Iraq to understand why they go, where they go from and what happens to them. By analysing around 160 profiles, it reveals the way in which people have travelled in clusters - a group of three young friends from Coventry, another group from Portsmouth, drawn out by one person they knew, others in Cardiff linked to people involved in an extremist organisation. Social media might play a part but face-to-face contact appears just as, if not more, important, according to the database.It includes the stories of: The BBC research emphasises the extent to which real-world contacts, rather than just online connections, are often a key driver of radicalisation and intent to travel to Iraq and Syria. Some of the experts who appeared before the Home Affairs Committee also argued the internet was a secondary influence. They said that universities and prisons were among the two most significant places where radicalisation occurred. A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police, which was not aware of the report, said it would have ""welcomed the opportunity"" to have given evidence to the committee and that it planned to look at the report in detail.The disappearance of schoolgirls Shamima Begum, Amira Abase, both 15, and Kadiza Sultana, 16, from east London in February, raised questions as to who could have done more to prevent their departure. After taking evidence from the police and the families of the girls among others, Mr Vaz said their case suffered from a ""lack of immediate action"". He added: ""Schools and the police must inform parents immediately, and work with them even if there is the smallest hint of radicalisation, or a close association with someone who is thought to have been radicalised.""However, the Met Police spokesman defended the speed of the police response to the schoolgirls' disappearance.  He said the committee's criticism was ""misleading"", pointing to the evidence given by both UK and Turkish authorities of ""rapid exchanges"" between the two.The committee's report said there needed to be an advice service which would be a less extreme step than calling the anti-terrorist hotline.The Association of Chief Police Officer's lead officer for the government's anti-terror strategy Prevent, Chief Constable Sir Peter Fahy, agreed that more needed to be done.However, he said the police ""do not have the capacity"" to routinely work with every school in the country.He added: ""The police service will play its part but the prime responsibility for dissuading young people from getting involved in extremist activity has to lie with parents, families and carers.""The committee also pointed to weaknesses in information sharing with airlines and other countries. It said greater care needed to be taken at airport check-in desks when people were travelling to destinations of concern - namely Syria, Somalia, Iraq and Nigeria, as well as neighbouring countries, such as Turkey. The report said police also needed to work faster to alert overseas partners and airlines when there were concerns over individuals.There were signs that some of the girls had followed extremist accounts on social media, the report said.The committee said that social media companies, such as Facebook and Twitter, should be prepared to suspend accounts when there is evidence they are being used to promote violent extremism.  The report also said it was disappointed the Home Office had not implemented a programme for individuals returning to Britain where there is evidence they had fought in Syria.Security officials estimate that some 600 Britons have left the country to join IS - and while around half may have returned, many are still out there - and some have died.  The BBC project includes detailed profiles of individuals which can be searched, based on hometown, age and gender, as well as those who have been convicted in the courts or who are believed to have been killed."

If not, the prince's private letters will either remain confidential, as the sender intended, or they'll be exposed to a large and inquisitive audience.

That will be a clear pledge from us.""He accused Mr Cameron of making an ""out of the blue, panicky"" announcement on VAT that ""no one in Britain will believe"".Labour, which has already announced plans to increase the top rate of income tax and impose a new ""mansion tax"" on high value properties, insists its plans are fully costed and will not require additional tax hikes if it wins May's general election.Mr Miliband began his final head-to-head encounter with Mr Cameron before the election by joking that the PM had ""announced his retirement plans"" - a reference to a BBC interview in which the prime minister said he would not serve a third term if the Tories remained in power.Challenging Mr Cameron to give a ""straight answer to a straight question"", Mr Miliband pressed him on whether he would rule out a rise in VAT after the election, as Labour had done.In response, the prime minister immediately said ""yes"", prompting loud cheers in turn from the Conservative benches. He contrasted what he said was a ""clear promise"" with Labour's unwillingness to rule out a rise in National Insurance.""I answered a very simple question about VAT. I ruled out an increase... straight answer to him, straight question from me. I have ruled out VAT. Will he rule out national insurance contributions. Yes or no?"" Mr Cameron added: ""We all know this is Labour's job tax. This is their tax of choice. This is what they clobber working people, families and enterprises with.""But Mr Miliband responded by saying there was ""only one person who is going to raise taxes on working families and that is him"".He said nobody would believe Mr Cameron on VAT ""because of his extreme spending plans, because his numbers do not add up and because he promised it last time and broke his promise"".Mr Cameron, he added, had broken other promises made before the last election to reduce annual net migration below 100,000 and not to pursue a major structural re-organisation of the NHS, adding that it was ""time for a better plan and time for a Labour government"".But Mr Cameron suggested a future Labour government would result in the ""chaos of economic crisis"", with Ed Miliband being ""held hostage"" by the SNP.The packed session provided a last opportunity for the two men to rally their MPs and set out their arguments before the start of the election campaign next week.Speaking after the exchanges and the other parties' tax pledges, deputy prime minister Nick Clegg said the Lib Dems ""don't need to raise VAT, national insurance or headline rates of income tax or corporation tax either"".""There are other taxes and other tax loopholes that we can increase or close in order to balance the books,"" he said.

2015-04-19,Met police 'had files on MPs in 90s',https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32044580,"A former undercover police officer has told BBC News that Scotland Yard kept intelligence files on MPs during the 1990s. Ex-Special Branch officer Peter Francis says he saw files on 10 Labour MPs which he and others regularly updated. He says he personally gathered information on three MPs as part of his work infiltrating left-wing groups. The MPs named, and Labour, have called for a forthcoming public inquiry into undercover policing to be widened. Mr Francis operated undercover between 1993 and 1997 in the Met's now disbanded Special Demonstration Squad. He was told to embed himself in left-wing groups or causes that were deemed to pose a potential threat to security. He says that during this period he was told to gather intelligence on MPs and their activities if and when they featured in any of his operations. That information, he says, was added to a special pink file that was available for Special Branch officers to read. Between 1990 and 2001, he claims to have personally seen records relating to Diane Abbott, the late Tony Benn, Jeremy Corbyn, the late Bernie Grant, Peter Hain, Harriet Harman, Ken Livingstone, Joan Ruddock, Dennis Skinner and Jack Straw.Four of the group became ministers during Mr Francis's time in Special Branch - including Jack Straw who was home secretary after 1997. ""When I was deployed undercover in the Special Demonstration Squad, any MP that I came across, such as on demonstrations, I would report back on them,"" he said. Mr Francis says that the files not only contained the MPs' publicly-stated political views - but also intelligence on what was going on behind the scenes in the party or their group. He says some of the information would have been things said in private by the MP, depending on how close each undercover officer had been able to get. Mr Francis said that when he first saw the files he understood that each had probably been created before the individual was an MP because of their personal involvement in radical causes or protests.But he added: ""When they became MPs these files carried on. It [was] your duty as an SDS officer to report back any intelligence that you come across. ""I felt that it was OK to report back on MPs,"" he said. ""I used to give myself a pat on the back, thinking 'I have done a good job'. These MPs were spied on and they should know.""""I don't think the police force should be monitoring MPs, full stop. I don't think we have any right to do that at all. It may be justifiable to say that the Security Service should be doing it - but I certainly don't think the police should be doing it.""Scotland Yard has refused to comment on the substance of the claims, but a spokesman said it had not shied away from serious allegations about the SDS. It said that Operation Herne, the internal police investigation into what happened in the unit, remained an ongoing investigation.""Operation Herne maintains that without speaking to Peter Francis it is simply not possible to fully investigate allegations he makes,"" said a spokesman. ""Operation Herne remains very willing to engage with him.""Mr Francis said that he has refused to speak to Operation Herne because he fears being interviewed under caution as a suspect, rather than a whistleblower. Scotland Yard told the BBC that Operation Herne detectives would be prepared to speak to him as a witness. He has, however, spoken to Mark Ellison QC who reviewed allegations about the SDS for the Home Secretary Theresa May - prompting her to launch a statutory inquiry. He says he will appear before those hearings. Peter Hain, who was a leader of the anti-apartheid movement in the late 1960s and 70s and became an MP in 1991, said he now wants full answers from Scotland Yard. ""I was deeply disturbed to find that files were still being kept by the Special Branch while I and others were serving Members of Parliament,"" he said. ""That is constitutionally an outrage. It infringes the sovereignty of Parliament. ""I want to see the home secretary widen the scope of the inquiry into the SDS to look specifically at the surveillance of MPs and the fact that there were active files on us while we were serving Members of Parliament. ""This should never have happened and it should have been reported and properly authorised - and we don't know whether it was.""Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper echoed the call for the inquiry to be widened in light of what she described as ""extremely serious and disturbing allegations"".""While undercover policing remains a crucial tool in combating serious and organised crime it must not be abused,"" she said.""There have now been a series of serious allegations about undercover policing - ranging from the treatment of Stephen Lawrence's family to police having long-term inappropriate relationships. ""We called some time ago for much stronger oversight of undercover policing and it is also vital to get to the truth about what has happened."" Mrs May announced earlier this month that Lord Justice Pitchford would lead the inquiry into the SDS allegations - but the precise shape of that inquiry is not yet clear.A Home Office spokesman said the review by Mark Ellison QC had unearthed ""serious historical failings"". ""That is why the Home Secretary established a public inquiry to thoroughly investigate undercover policing and the operation of the Special Demonstration Squad. ""Lord Justice Pitchford will consult interested parties to the inquiry over the coming months on setting the terms of reference, with a view to publishing these at the end of July.""Undercover policing is an essential tactic in the fight against crime but to improve the public's confidence in undercover work we must ensure there is no repeat of these failings in the future."""
2015-04-19,NHS problems worst 'since 1990s',https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/health-32057948,"Services in the NHS in England are deteriorating in a way not seen since the early 1990s, according to a leading health think tank. The King's Fund review said waiting times for A&E, cancer care and routine operations had all started getting worse, while deficits were growing.It said such drops in performance had not been seen for 20 years.But the think tank acknowledged the NHS had done as well as could be expected, given the financial climate.Professor John Appleby, chief economist at the King's Fund, which specialises in health care policy, said: ""The next government will inherit a health service that has run out of money and is operating at the very edge of its limits. ""There is now a real risk that patient care will deteriorate as service and financial pressures become overwhelming.""He said in terms of how standards were slipping - not how low they had reached - the situation was the worst it had been since the ""early 1990s"".The report noted much of the deterioration has happened in the second-half of the Parliament with many measures of performance being maintained in the first few years.It said the next government had to address the funding situation, adding the extra £8bn a year NHS England says is needed by 2020, was the ""minimum"" that would be required.The report - a review of performance this Parliament - highlights a range of problems as well as achievements. These include:The report is the second part of the King's Fund pre-election review of the NHS this Parliament.Last month it warned the coalition government's reforms of the health service had been ""damaging and distracting"".The King's Fund report should make worrying reading. The reference to the 1990s conjures up images of - for the NHS at least - a bygone era. The think tank's point was not that waiting times had reached the level they were at then, rather that this is the first time in two decades of almost continuous improvement that there has been a sustained drop in performance.In many ways, that had to happen. Services cannot keep getting better for ever. Nonetheless, the findings are crystal clear: the NHS is at a critical juncture. But what is less easy to determine is to what extent the coalition's policies have contributed to the difficulties.The think tank has already provided a critical analysis of the government's reforms - and when pushed, acknowledged the health service may have been ""in better shape"" if they had not happened.But the more significant issue for the health of the health service this Parliament has been the squeeze on finances. Even though the budget has been increased, it has felt more like a cut to many because demands have risen so quickly.On this though, the King's Fund accepted that the government's hands were tied. Given the state of the economy, ministers did as much as they could have.Read more from NickRoyal College of Nursing general secretary Peter Carter said politicians needed to take note of the warnings made by the King's Fund.""Morale is low, and more and more staff are being made sick with stress because of the intolerable pressure they are under,"" he added. Katherine Murphy, of the Patients Association, said: ""The findings echo what we are hearing on a daily basis on our helpline. It is clear to the public that the future of the NHS is one of the most important issues facing the nation and it should be a central issue in the election campaign.""Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham said: ""Five years ago David Cameron stood on a promise to protect the NHS. This report provides authoritative proof that he has broken that promise.""But a Department of Health spokesman said: ""As the King's Fund says, the NHS has 'performed well in the face of huge challenges', but if we are to continue to invest in the NHS going forward it needs to be backed by a strong economy.""

2015-04-19,SNP 'could block Tory government',https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32045419,"The SNP would block a minority Conservative government by voting down its Queen's Speech if it holds the post-election balance of power, its former leader Alex Salmond has said.Mr Salmond said the move could bring down the government if Labour joined in, with David Cameron ""locked out"".The Conservatives accused him of ""trying to sabotage the democratic will of the British people"".Labour has called his balance of power prediction ""bluster and bluff"".In recent days Mr Salmond, who is bidding to become a Westminster MP at the 7 May general election, has claimed his party could ""hold the power"" in a hung Parliament and would be able to influence the Budget of a minority Labour government.This was dismissed by Labour leader Ed Miliband, who has ruled out a formal coalition with the Scottish nationalists.The SNP currently has six MPs at Westminster, but recent opinion polls suggest its share could increase dramatically at the general election.James Cook, BBC News Scotland correspondentIf the Conservatives attempt to form a minority government and enough MPs vote against their Queen's Speech the administration would fall at the first hurdle and the leader of the opposition would have a shot at forming a government.That's how parliamentary democracy works in the event of a hung Parliament.And yet the Conservatives are saying that by planning to vote against a government he opposes Alex Salmond has ""confirmed he would sabotage the democratic will of the British people in order to make Ed Miliband prime minister"".It is part of their continuing attempt to portray Mr Miliband as a weak leader whose strings are being pulled by Mr Salmond.This kind of language causes despair among Tories north of the border who fear that the party in London is waltzing into an SNP trap.They know that many voters in Scotland will read the phrase ""democratic will of the British people"" and hear ""democratic will of the English people"".Because, if it is illegitimate for Scottish MPs, from whatever party, to vote against one government and support another in the British parliament, then what, voters may ask, is the point of the union?Who is dancing to Mr Salmond's tune now?Mr Salmond, the former Scottish first minister, told the New Statesman that in the event of a hung Parliament, a minority Conservative government would have to ""go straight effectively for a vote of confidence - usually the Queen's Speech, although it could be otherwise, of course - and we'd be voting against.""If David Cameron lost this vote, he said, there would be a two-week period for another government to be formed.BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said Mr Salmond had ""hardened his anti-Conservative rhetoric"" in the interview.A Conservative spokesman said:  ""Alex Salmond has confirmed he would sabotage the democratic will of the British people in order to make Ed Miliband prime minister. ""That would mean chaos for Britain, with weak Ed Miliband dancing to Alex Salmond's tune.""He said the ""only way to keep Britain together"" was to vote Conservative.Mr Salmond's latest comments come after Mr Miliband said the only people writing a future Labour Budget would be himself and shadow chancellor Ed Balls.Speaking in Clydebank on Monday, he added: ""It's not going to be Alex Salmond - not in a million years."""
2015-04-19,MPs criticise 'lack of EU debate',https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32045290,"The government's ""failure"" to let MPs debate EU legislation is ""deplorable"", a Parliamentary committee says.The European Scrutiny Committee said ministers had refused to schedule debates on issues such as free movement and the EU's Budget.It also said BBC coverage of EU matters should be ""improved substantially"".The government said the number of EU debates had doubled since 2009-10, while the BBC said its coverage was ""extensive and impartial"".The cross-party committee's role includes scrutinising EU documents and recommending the most important for debate in the House of Commons.Its report said in the period covering most of the 2014-15 financial year there were three debates on the floor of the House, compared with 12 in 2013-14.It also pointed out that not a single debate had taken place during a nine-month period, between 9 June 2014 and 9 March 2015.""The government's collective failure to schedule so many debates on EU documents over the past year is deplorable, and is a discourtesy to this committee and to all members of the House,"" the MPs said.Prime Minister David Cameron has sought to rally support from other EU leaders for his plans to curb welfare payments to European migrants ahead of a referendum on the UK's membership if he wins the general election.The committee said the government's ""cavalier"" approach was ""at odds with UK ministers' claims in their speeches across the EU about the role of national parliaments"".The Foreign Office said the government was committed to a ""strong EU scrutiny system that enables Parliament to hold it to account for the decisions taken in Brussels"".It added: ""We have made good on our commitment to raise standards by doubling the number of Europe debates on the floor of the House since 2009-10.""This government has also increased by around a fifth since 2010 the number of EU proposals that have been scrutinised and cleared by Parliament before being agreed in Brussels.""The committee has also been examining the BBC's coverage of European issues, taking evidence from director general Lord Hall and head of news James Harding earlier this month.During that appearance, Lord Hall said the desire for balanced output ""ran deep"" within the BBC and he believed that this was being achieved.Mr Harding said if the public was going to trust the BBC to report on politicians impartially it had to be clear that BBC journalists weren't ""asked by politicians to come and account for what they do and in effect do the bidding of those politicians"".But the committee said it was ""concerned about the manner in which the BBC treats EU issues"", calling for coverage to be ""improved substantially"".It suggested coverage did not reflect all sides of the debate on the European Union, and more analysis was needed. Its chairman, Conservative MP Sir William Cash, said the BBC had ""very particular obligations"" to be impartial and to ""educate and inform"".He added:  ""We do not believe this is currently being achieved in the context of the BBC's EU coverage.""A BBC spokesman said the corporation provided extensive and impartial coverage of European and Parliamentary issues, and it would be a breach of the corporation's independence if a committee of MPs instructed the BBC on its coverage."
2015-04-19,Lobbyists must 'conform' with rules,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32047992,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe woman in charge of the government's new register of lobbyists has said she expects the industry to ""conform"" with the statutory system. Speaking ahead of the register's launch, Alison White conceded a lot of lobbyists would not be listed on it.But she said her job was to make sure the rules were implemented and she would do so with ""extreme verve and vigour.""But one critic of the register said it was ""fake"" and full of ""loopholes"".Lobbyists are companies or individuals paid to influence government decisions.The coalition promised to introduce a statutory register of lobbyists when it came to power in 2010, and legislation was passed last year, with ministers saying the move would help clean up politics.However, the new register will only cover consultant lobbyists and will not apply to lobbyists working ""in-house"" for companies or organisations.A person or company will only need to be registered if they are contacting a government minister or permanent secretary in a government department - leading to criticism it will not come close to reflecting the scale or nature of lobbying that goes on across Whitehall.But Ms White, who is independent of the government, said her task was to implement the law as it stood not to question the powers she had been given. ""We are having something that has never been in place before,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""This is a statutory register. The industry tells me it is a professional industry. I expect them to conform with the legislation. It is my job to make sure they do so.""Ms White, who was appointed as the registrar of consultant lobbyists in September, acknowledged the register would not indicate different ""levels of lobbying"".""The legislation was quite narrowly drafted to address a particular issue, which was that it was not always particularly clear, when ministers were being lobbied, who the client of the lobbyist was. That is what the register was set up to do,"" she said.She added: ""This will give anyone who wishes to access the register the opportunity to be able to see who is lobbying and being paid for it and who their clients are. That is the main information the register will contain.""If a lobbyist sets out to influence government policy in some way, they would have to be registered. If they are not registered, then they would not be conforming. They have to go on the register before they lobby.""Ms White said last month that the register would not have any entries on its launch day but she had received more than ""20 expressions of interest"" about joining and companies and individuals might be required to sign up retrospectively.Potential registrants will be able to log on and create an account to file an ""information return"".But Tamasin Cave, from the Alliance for Lobbying Transparency coalition, said ""hardly anyone"" in the industry would be covered by the provisions of the new law. ""You have a huge commercial lobbying industry, and very few of them will have to sign up,"" she told Today.""The second flaw is that it won't show the interaction between lobbyists and government, and that is what a register is for.""It is to show the activity - who is discussing what with whom, but this shows nothing of this interaction. It is a fake register."""
2015-04-19,Car smoking ban MSP welcomes backing,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-south-scotland-32055226,"The Liberal Democrat MSP behind a bill to ban smoking in cars when children are present has welcomed the support of the Scottish government.South of Scotland MSP Jim Hume launched the members' bill in December.The government said it was ""very supportive"" of the principles of the bill, but changes could be needed to make it ""workable"".Motorists could potentially be fined £100 for breaching the rule if it becomes law.Mr Hume lodged draft proposals for a bill last May calling for a ban in Scotland on smoking in private vehicles when children under 18 were present.He said he was ""over the moon"" at the news the Scottish government would endorse the Smoking Prohibition (Children in Motor Vehicles) (Scotland) Bill.He said: ""With cross-party support and the support of many third sector organisations, there is every chance that this could be in place in the next year.""Eighty-four per cent of the 160 responses to my consultation were positive and people from across Scotland have expressed their support for the move.""The bill is about guaranteeing that children in Scotland can have the freedom to go on and lead healthy lives if they choose to.""I look forward to working with MSPs from all parties as the bill progresses.""Public Health Minister Maureen Watt said the Scottish government had considered including the measure in its Public Health Bill, but instead decided to support Mr Hume's proposals.She said: ""As with any bill, as it goes through the scrutiny process, there may be amendments and improvements to strengthen the legislation and ensure it is fit for purpose. ""But we believe that the underpinning principles are strong, and that is why I am pleased to support it.""Scottish Labour and a wide range of health organisations have backed his proposals.But the Scottish Conservatives have reservations about how the bill would work in practice.The party's health spokesman Jackson Carlaw said: ""While Scottish Conservatives support any moves which would protect young people from hazardous second hand smoke we have concerns as to how this would be enforced.""It would be a better use of resources to conduct a public awareness campaign similar to that which is being proposed by the government in Wales.""We will be watching this campaign in order to ascertain what lessons may be learned and what approaches may be adopted in Scotland.""Anti-smoking campaigners welcomed the Scottish government's backing for Mr Hume's bill.ASH Scotland's chief executive Sheila Duffy said: ""It is another public health initiative that can help Scotland move forward with its ambition to achieve a tobacco-free generation in 20 years' time.""It is popular with the public and will bring Scotland into line with upcoming legislation in England and Wales.""We believe it can be effectively enforced and that having the legislation focus on cars with children bypasses concerns over interference in people's private lives.""Jim Hume must be congratulated for taking the initiative on this proposal and for all the hard work he and his team have done to bring this important measure forward.""But Simon Clark, director of the smokers' group Forest, said the bill was ""legislation for legislation's sake"".He said: ""Smoking in cars carrying children is inconsiderate. The overwhelming majority of smokers know that and don't do it.""The very small number that do will carry on regardless because the law will be difficult, if not impossible, to enforce.""Education has to be better than legislation but the government prefers gesture politics and the big stick."""
2015-04-19,Candidate quits over UKIP MEP remark,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32038485,"A UKIP election candidate has quit the party over comments made by the party's only Scottish MEP about a Scottish government minister.Tim Wilson has decided not to stand in South Northamptonshire after David Coburn MEP compared Humza Yousaf to convicted terrorist Abu Hamza.Mr Coburn has apologised for the remarks, saying it was a ""joke"".A spokesman for UKIP said Mr Wilson had failed to emphasise local issues in his general election campaign.UKIP leader Nigel Farage said Mr Coburn's remarks were a ""joke in poor taste"" but he would not be taking any action against him.But Mr Wilson said he was disillusioned with the party over the ""racist jibes"" and has decided to stand down.He told BBC Scotland he was appalled by Mr Coburn's comments about Mr Yousaf and frustrated by the inaction of the party's leadership on the issue.  He said David Coburn had produced ""what I can only describe as an Islamaphobic insult, and that's simply not acceptable"".  Mr Wilson added: ""Of course he went on and apologised.  I think, frankly, that if you are in a position of power you have to be able to control what ideas emerge from your head and how they get to your mouth and, in fact, you shouldn't have those ideas in the first place.  ""But the real issue is that when Mr Farage was asked what he thought about this he dismissed this as a joke.  ""I don't think this is a joke. I think this is something very serious.  It may not be that this man intended to cause offence but we aren't interested in what his intentions are.  We are interested in the effect what he says has on other people and the effect is catastrophic, it's appalling and I've resigned.""In his resignation letter, Mr Wilson said he had been ""systematically gagged by the party whip"" and forbidden to speak about Islam favourably. A spokesman for UKIP said Mr Wilson had failed to put more emphasis on local issues in his campaign.He said: ""Whilst we had initially been optimistic about Tim Wilson's abilities as a candidate, it became obvious in recent weeks that he was out of his depth in representing our party in the way we would expect. ""Mr Wilson had clearly misunderstood the expectations that UKIP place on all of its candidates. Principal amongst those is focusing on issues that are relevant to local voters. UKIP put huge emphasis on local issues and Mr Wilson was unwilling to follow UKIP guidelines in this respect.""Last week MSPs at the Scottish Parliament unanimously condemned the remarks made by Mr Coburn during a newspaper interview.MSPs were debating a motion celebrating Scotland's diverse communities.The president of the European Parliament, Martin Schulz, condemned the remarks, saying they were ""not worthy of any elected member"". But a spokesman for the president said he could not act on remarks made outside parliament.The move comes just days after another candidate, Jonathan Stanley, quit in protest at the ""racist filth"" in UKIP. Mr Stanley, who was due to stand in the Cumbrian seat of Westmorland and Lonsdale, was the party's former head of policy in Scotland."

2015-04-19,Manifesto watch,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-29642613,"Political parties are putting together their manifestos for May's general election. Here's a guide to where they currently stand on the issues voters say they care about most (according to pollsters IPSOS Mori).ImmigrationConservatives:  David Cameron wants to make migrants wait four years before they can claim certain benefits, such as tax credits, Universal Credit, or get access to social housing. He wants to stop migrants from claiming child benefit for dependents living outside the UK, and remove those that have failed to find work after six months. Mr Cameron has promised to put reform of EU free movement rules at the heart of his renegotiation of Britain's relationship with the EU. He has ruled out a temporary cap on migrant numbers or an ""emergency brake"" on EU freedom of movement rules - ideas both mooted in recent months, saying this would be less ""effective"" than reducing the incentives for people to come to the UK. The party has a continuing goal to bring net immigration down to below 100,000 people a year (it currently stands at 243,000).Labour: ""Stronger"" border controls to tackle illegal immigration with ""proper"" entry and exit checks. ""Smarter"" targets to reduce low-skilled migration but ensure university students and high-skilled workers are not deterred. Employment agencies who only recruit abroad will be outlawed while the fines for employing illegal immigrants will be increased.Lib Dems: Reintroduce exit checks at borders, so the government can identify people who are overstaying their visa. Will require all new claimants for Jobseekers Allowance to have their English language skills assessed, with JSA then being conditional on attending language courses for those whose English is poor. Ensure that EU migrants have to ""earn"" their entitlement to benefits.SNP: Allow the devolved government to have control over immigration to Scotland, and introduce a Canadian-style earned citizenship system to attract highly-skilled immigrants.Plaid Cymru: Oppose a points-based system. Support the right of asylum seekers to work in Wales while they wait for status decisions to be made. Lobby the Westminster government to ensure that they shut ""detention"" centres.UKIP: Introduce an Australian-style points policy, used to select migrants with the skills and attributes needed to work in the country - covering people from inside and outside the EU. Bring net immigration down to 50,000 people a year. Priority lanes for UK passport holders. Increase UK border staff by 2,500. Tougher English language tests for migrants seeking permanent residence. Opt out of the Dublin treaty to allow the UK to return asylum seekers to other EU countries without considering their claim. Anyone who currently has the legal right to live, work, or study in the UK would not face deportation in the event of the country's withdrawal from the EU.Greens:  Progressively reduce UK immigration controls. Migrants illegally in the UK for over five years will be allowed to remain unless they pose a serious danger to public safety. More legal rights for asylum seekers.Taxes and the economyConservatives: Eradicate the deficit by 2018 and secure an overall budget surplus by 2019-20. Achieve this by spending cuts, not tax rises, while raising NHS spending. An income tax cut for 30 million people by 2020. Tax would start to kick in at £12,500 a year, instead of £10,500. This will cost £5.6bn. The higher tax rate, 40%, would start at £50,000 instead of £41,900, again by 2020, at a cost of £1.6bn. This will be paid for through £25bn in additional spending cuts and economic growth. No increases in VAT.Labour: Get the current budget into surplus and the national debt falling ""as soon as possible in the next parliament"". No additional borrowing for new spending. Reintroduce the 50p top rate of income tax for earnings over £150,000.  Cut income tax for 24 million people by bringing back the 10p rate, paid for by scrapping the Married Couples' Tax Allowance. Bring in a ""mansion tax"" on properties worth over £2m, to raise £1.2bn. A tax on bankers' bonuses. A 5% pay cut for every government minister. Push for UK overseas territories to be put on an international blacklist if they refuse to co-operate with a drive against tax avoidance. No increases in VAT or National Insurance contributions.Lib Dems: Raise the personal allowance - the point at which you start paying income tax - to £11,000 in April 2016 and then to £12,500 by 2020. ""Strict new fiscal rules"" to ensure the deficit has gone by April 2018, with the wealthy contributing the most. The Lib Dems invented the ""mansion tax"" but in contrast to Labour have set out how it would operate - along similar lines to council tax bands. There are also Lib Dem plans to increase capital gains tax - paid on profits from second homes or shares - from 28% to 35%. Impose an additional 8% rate of corporation tax on UK banks to raise an extra £1bn a year to help pay off the deficit.SNP: Oppose UK plans in the Infrastructure Bill which will allow oil and gas drilling and hydraulic fracturing beneath people's homes without consent. Invest in offshore wind farming. Support an international bank tax and limits to industry bonuses.Plaid Cymru: Build a Green Skills Construction College, specialising in green energy. Establish a publicly-owned energy company. Establish a publicly-owned Bank of Wales business investment bank. Enforce a living wage. Give devolved nations an equal say in institutions that affect everyone's lives, such as the Bank of England.UKIP: Increase the personal allowance to the level of full-time minimum wage earnings, about £13,500, by 2020. Abolish inheritance tax. Introduce a 35% income tax rate between £42,285 and £55,000, at which point the 40% rate becomes payable. Set up a Treasury Commission to design a turnover tax on large businesses. Cut foreign aid budget by £9bn a year. Scrap HS2. Save £8bn a year in membership fees by leaving the EU.  Lower the VAT rate charged on restorations to listed buildings.Greens: People earning more than £100,000 a year would pay 50% income tax. Wealth tax of 1% to 2% on people worth £3m or more. Renationalise the railways and energy companies. Scrap HS2. Allow councils to impose extra business rates on out-of-town supermarkets to fund small local businesses. Crackdown on tax avoidance by multinationals. Allow ""the current dependence on economic growth to cease, and allow zero or negative growth to be feasible without individual hardship"". Commit Britain to a ""zero carbon"" future. Cut rail and bus fares by an average of 10%. Enforce a cap on bankers' bonuses.The NHSConservatives:  Chancellor George Osborne says he will put an extra £2bn into frontline health services across the UK, which he described as a ""down payment"" on a plan drawn up by NHS bosses calling for an extra £8bn a year above inflation by 2020. In England, everyone would be able to see a GP seven days a week by 2020. Recruit 5,000 more doctors.Labour:  Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said Labour would commit an extra £2.5bn a year above Mr Osborne's plan. The money will come from three sources - a new ""mansion"" tax, clamping down on tax avoidance by big corporations and a new tax on tobacco companies. Patients in England would get a GP appointment within 48 hours and would not have to wait longer than a week for cancer tests and results. Scrap the Health and Social Care Act and end ""creeping privatisation"" of the NHS.  Integrate health and social care services into a system of ""whole-person care"". Give greater priority to mental health services. Replace the Cancer Drugs Fund in England when it runs out in 2016 with a £330m fund to improve access to innovative cancer drugs, surgery and radiotherapy. Recruit 5,000 more healthcare workers to help patients stay in their homes and introduce new safety checks to identify people at risk of hospitalisation. Prioritise child mental health by increasing the proportion of the mental health budget spent on children.Lib Dems: An extra £1bn for the NHS every year, to be funded by - amongst other things - making higher earners pay more tax on their shares. Half of this will go towards mental health. Ensure that spending on the NHS rises in line with growth in the economy. People who need therapy for conditions such as depression will be guaranteed treatment within 18 weeks. For young patients experiencing psychosis for the first time treatment will be provided within two weeks of being referred by a GP. This is all going to happen from April, with more mental health targets to follow if the Lib Dems return to government. Wants a cross-party review of the future of NHS funding.SNP: Reduce the number of senior managers in the NHS by 25% over the next parliament. Streamline the work of health boards. Real terms increases in year-on-year NHS spending.Plaid Cymru: Recruit 1,000 extra doctors to the Welsh NHS over two terms of a Plaid government. Offer financial incentives for recruiting doctors to areas and specialisms where there are, or are predicted to be, shortages. Encourage innovation and attract more research funding, in part by increasing research and development funding as government finance allows. Improve training for postgraduate doctors and stop them being used to ""plug gaps"" in staff rotas. More recruitment from within the EU to fill vacancies and using international doctors to staff the NHS while a new generation of Welsh doctors are trained.UKIP: An extra £3bn per year in NHS funding paid for by quitting the EU and through ""middle management"" cuts. Keep NHS free at the point of delivery. Stop any further use of PFI, and encourage local authorities to buy out their PFI contracts early where it is affordable to do so. Ensure all visitors and migrants who have been here for fewer than five years have NHS-approved medical insurance as a condition of entry to UK, with £200m of the £2bn saved to be spent on ending hospital parking charges in England. Bring back state-enrolled nurses and return powers to matrons. Monitor and Care Quality Commission to be replaced with elected county health boards. Stop spending £90m a year on gastric band and breast enhancement operations.Greens: Funding to be diverted away from centralised facilities towards community healthcare, illness prevention and health promotion.  Stop privatisation. Abolish prescription charges. Dedicated NHS Tax to go direct to the health service. Ban proactive recruitment of non-British NHS staff from overseas. A complete ban on the promotion of tobacco and alcohol products, including sponsorship.Security, defence and foreign affairsConservatives: Hold a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU by 2017, after negotiating the return of some powers from Brussels. Protect foreign aid budget. Replace Trident.Labour:  Push for reform of European Union and prevent Britain from ""sleepwalking"" towards exit. Commit in law to holding a Strategic Defence and Security Review every 5 years. Outlaw discrimination and abuse of Armed Forces personnel.Lib Dems: Campaign to reduce the number of Trident nuclear submarines. Push for greater European Union efficiency. SNP: Oppose nuclear weapons and push for removal of Trident submarines from Scotland. In 2010, proposed a Scottish Centre for Reconciliation and Conflict Resolution, to promote peaceful alternatives to armed conflict. Maintain 0.7% commitment to foreign aid. Enhanced role for Scotland within the UK in Europe, particularly in fisheries policy.Plaid Cymru: Honour commitment of 0.7% of budget used for foreign aid. Campaign for cancellation of developing countries' debts. Support the Fair Trade movement. Support the 'Tobin' or 'Robin hood' tax as a means of encouraging more responsibility and stability in the global markets. Reform the IMF and World Bank in order to improve regulation and accountability. Continue membership of the EU, but campaign for democratic reform. Support minority nations and minority language speakers around the world. Pass a Military Wellbeing Act to promote and safeguard the physical and mental health and wellbeing of military personnel.UKIP:  Leave the European Union. Remove the passports of any person who has gone to fight for a terrorist organisation and deport anyone who has committed a terrorist act. Cut foreign aid budget by £9bn. Create a Veterans Department to look after the interests of ex-service men and women.Greens: Referendum on Britain's EU membership. Want reform of EU to hand powers back to local communities. Boost overseas aid to 1% of GDP within 10 years. Scrap Britain's nuclear weapons. Take the UK out of NATO unilaterally. End the so-called ""special relationship"" between the UK and the US.  Stop EU-US free trade deal TTIP. JobsConservatives: Create three million apprenticeships to be paid for by benefit cuts.Labour: Guarantee a job for under 25s unemployed for over a year and adults unemployed for more than two years. As many young people to go on an apprenticeship as currently go to university by 2025. Create a million new high technology, green jobs by 2025. Ban ""exploitative"" zero hour contracts.Lib Dems: An extra £1 an hour for the lowest paid apprentices. Campaign to create a million more jobs.SNP: Introduce gender quotas on public boards. Living wage ""a central priority"" in all Scottish government contracts. Continue the 'small business bonus'.Plaid Cymru: Provide rates relief for small businesses. Increase the number and value of contracts from Welsh public bodies that go to firms within Wales.UKIP: Allow firms to offer jobs to British workers first ""without the fear of being sued for discrimination"".Greens: A national energy conservation scheme to create thousands of new jobs. The party wants to create ""sustainable jobs"" and promotes more local production of food and goods.Education Conservatives: Protect England's schools budget - from reception entry at age four or five to the end of GCSEs at 16 - in cash terms although funding per pupil will not keep pace with inflation. Pre-school and post 16 education not ring fenced. Convert up to 3,500 more schools judged by Ofsted to ""require improvement"" into academies. ""War on illiteracy and innumeracy"". State primary schools in England that repeatedly failed to have a proportion of year-six pupil pass times tables and writing tests be forced to become academies, or have sponsorship replaced if already an academy. Opposed to giving votes to 16 and 17-year-olds for UK-wide general elections and local elections in England.Labour:  Increase the overall education budget in England, including schools, nurseries, Sure Start and provision for 16-to 18-year-olds, by at least the rate of inflation, although per-pupil funding is not specifically protected, meaning some of the increase will be eaten up by rising pupil numbers. Parents of primary school children would be guaranteed childcare from 8am to 6pm. The amount of free childcare for three and four year olds would be increased from 15 to 25 hours a week. Compulsory sex and relationship education in all schools. Refuse to grant business rate relief to independent schools unless they can show a ""meaningful impact"" on state schools through a new School Partnership Standard, for example by lending teaching staff or assisting in university admissions procedures. Committed to extending the franchise to 16 and 17-year-olds in elections across the UK. Double the number of Sure Start childcare places to more than 118,000. Tighten up the rules on primary school class sizes to ensure they do not have more than 30 pupils.Lib Dems: Protect the education budget from cuts. Guarantee qualified teachers and a core curriculum set by independent experts, as well as compulsory sex education, in all state schools including academies and free schools. More money for disadvantaged school children and free childcare for all two year olds. A two-thirds discount on all local bus fares for young people aged 16-21. Supports lowering the voting age to 16 in all UK elections.SNP: Guaranteed free 30 hours of childcare a week for three and four-year-olds in Scotland, up from 16 hours. Maintain lack of tuition fees at Scottish universities, and offer financial support in grants and loans to students. Continue to build and refurbish schools. Lower voting age to 16 in all UK elections.Plaid Cymru: Introduce a compulsory modern foreign language GCSE in secondary schools and the teaching of modern foreign languages in primary schools. Look at ways to strengthen the teaching of Welsh history and culture. Oppose foundation schools, academies and free schools. Look at moving from a per-pupil funding mechanism to a funding model based on the catchment area. Will not support any further increases in tuition fees for higher education students, and will seek the abolition of tuition fees as and when public finances allow. Supports lowering the voting age to 16 for elections to the Welsh Assembly and the UK Parliament.UKIP: More grammar schools. Scrap sex education for children aged under seven. Scrap tuition fees for students from poorer backgrounds who take degree courses in the sciences, technology, maths or engineering. Greater emphasis on vocational education with new Apprenticeship Qualification Option. School governing boards must be made up of at least 30% parents of children at the school. Allow universities to charge same amount for EU students as non-EU students.Greens: End performance related pay for teachers. Replace Ofsted with an independent National Council for Educational Excellence. Bring Free Schools and Academies into local authority control.

Withdraw Jobseeker's Allowance from young people after six months unless they take part in ""community projects"". And 18 to 21-year-olds wouldn't be entitled to housing benefit. Ban on zero-hours contracts which stop people getting work elsewhere. Raise the personal allowance - the point at which you start paying income tax - to £11,000 in April 2016 and then to £12,500 by 2020, which means that if you work on minimum wage for 30 hours you will pay no income tax. Young people out of work, education or training for six months will have to do unpaid community work to get benefits. This will apply to about 50,000 18 to 21-year-olds. Universal benefits for pensioners, such as free bus passes, TV licences for the over 75s and the winter fuel allowance. will once again be protected. Labour: Freeze energy prices until 2017. Increase in the minimum wage from £6.50-an-hour to £8-an-hour by 2020. Rises in child benefit capped at 1% for the first two years of the next parliament. Winter fuel allowance would be withdrawn from the wealthiest pensioners. Repeal what the government calls the spare room subsidy, dubbed the ""bedroom tax"" by Labour.  A million interest-free loans to help people insulate their homes. Rail fares would be capped. Double the amount of paid paternity leave available to new fathers from two to four weeks, and increase statutory paternity pay to £260 a week.Lib Dems: Raise the personal allowance - the point at which you start paying income tax - to £11,000 in April 2016 and then to £12,500 by 2020 (the Conservatives are promising the same thing). Nick Clegg has said he would not accept Conservative plans to freeze working-age benefits without taxing the rich too. He hasn't said he would block welfare cuts altogether. Withdraw eligibility for the Winter Fuel Payment and free TV Licence from pensioners on the 40% rate of income tax. A ""yellow card"" system to deal with benefit claimants breaking the rules, rather than imposing sanctions without warning.SNP: Oppose cuts to in-work benefits. Support moves to extend paternity leave. Introduce a maximum combined withdrawal rate for benefits and reforms to employment support allowance and cold weather payments. Protect policies such as concessionary travel for older Scots.Plaid Cymru: Move away from complex and expensive means testing for child-related benefits. Continue to campaign for the introduction of a living pension during the period of the next parliament for those aged 80 and over. UKIP: Only pay child benefit for the first two children for new claimants. Increase the Carers' Allowance to the same level as Jobseekers' Allowance (JSA) and pay a higher rate of JSA if you've been in work and already made tax and National Insurance contributions. Prevent anyone taking up permanent residence in Britain unless they're able to support themselves and any dependents they bring with them for at least five years and stop them receiving benefits. Stop paying child benefit for children who don't live in Britain. Scrap what UKIP calls the ""detested bedroom tax"". Boost ""credit unions"".Greens: The party backs a Citizen's Income, a fixed amount of £72 income a week to be paid to every individual, whether they are in work or not, to be funded by higher taxes on the better off and green levies.  But in the short-term it would increase the minimum wage to £10 by 2020. Ban zero hours contracts. Axe the ""bedroom tax"". Abolish the work capability assessment and restore the level of the former disability living allowance. Scrap the government's welfare cap, which limits the maximum amount a household can claim annually to £26,000 a year."

2015-04-19,Elephant trap?,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32047998,"The campaign has not even got under way, yet in the space of a couple of hours we have now been treated to not only one election pledge, but to two. The prime minister ruled out raising VAT if re-elected - while Labour said National Insurance contributions wouldn't go up.Usually politicians fudge the question of tax rises.  When he was leader of the opposition David Cameron himself said ""we have no need to raise taxes"" - before hiking up VAT after polling day.Famously, John Major said he had ""no plans"" to put up the sales tax -  before his chancellor did just that.And when he appeared in front of the cross-party Treasury committee of MPs on Tuesday, the current chancellor seemed to be continuing that tradition.  Under repeated questioning, George Osborne said: ""The policies we have do not involve a VAT rise.""That formulation appeared to give him not so much wriggle room, but an entire wriggle mansion.Labour assumed their campaign warning of further VAT rises to come under the Tories was very much on the money.But George Osborne's allies are suggesting privately that he had, in fact, been walking Ed Miliband to the edge of an elephant trap, then beckoning the prime minister to push the opposition leader in.Ed Miliband's strategists fully expected Mr Cameron to repeat the chancellor's obfuscation on tax at the final Prime Minister's Questions of this Parliament. They would then have expanded on the theme, inviting the prime minister to answer other difficult questions - then say he wasn't being straight with the British people for avoiding them.But the Labour leader was completely wrong-footed when first the prime minister said he would rule out a VAT rise and then counter-punched, inquiring if Labour would now rule out an increase in National Insurance contributions.Ed Miliband dodged the question and what could have been downbeat Conservative benches, uneasy over the prime minister's announcement this week of his retirement plans, were given something to cheer.The reason Ed Miliband didn't respond is because he was holding the National Insurance pledge back for Labour's manifesto.But that soon became unsustainable - so the other Ed, the shadow chancellor Ed Balls, had to undertake a hasty round of the TV studios to do just that.When I spoke to him mid-tour, he put on a brave face. His view was that George Osborne, having raised VAT from 17.5% to 20%, wanted to give the issue a low profile - whereas the prime minister had now made the mistake of putting it centre stage. And he believed David Cameron's promise would be judged against his past VAT-raising performance.He defended Ed Miliband's reluctance to talk about National Insurance as he felt it would have been ""inappropriate"" to announce Labour tax policy at PMQs.So the prime minister - always a better tactician than strategist - can at least satisfy himself that he smoked Labour out on NI and disrupted at least one entry in their election campaign grid.But the exchange actually raised more questions than it answered.If the main parties are ruling out further potential sources of revenue, but still committing themselves to eradicating a £90bn black hole in the public finances, will they now be under more pressure during the election campaign to spell out in much greater detail exactly what they intend to cut?"
2015-04-19,Who's next?,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32031343,"David Cameron's declaration that he will not seek a third term in office if he retains power in May has immediately stoked interest in who might fill his shoes when he's gone. Here are the likely - and perhaps less obvious - possibilities.Claim? As chancellor of the exchequer he's the man in charge of the purse strings and master strategist - and reportedly the PM's favourite to succeed him, although he hasn't said as much. Mr Cameron's right-hand man has had an image makeover of late, with a new haircut and a diet to shed some pounds. And he has seemingly recovered from his ""omnishambles"" Budget in 2012, with his latest - and last Budget - of the parliament giving the Tories a lead in some polls. He's said to be well liked among Conservative cabinet ministers and backbench MPs, whose support is vital for any candidate wanting to take on the party leadership. He shas some work to do among grassroots Tory members, however, coming fifth in ConservativeHome's latest online poll of party members on future leaders.Latest odds: 10/1 (according to William Hill)What's he said? ""The prime minister leads a strong team but what you see from him is answering a direct question with a direct answer. I think that's really refreshing. He says he's going to serve that full five years so the real question facing the country now is do you want the strong leadership of David Cameron that's delivering zero inflation and record jobs or do you want the chaos and incompetence of Ed Miliband.""Claim? The longest-serving home secretary in 50 years, she is only the second Conservative woman to secure one of the top four jobs in government. In her role, she has talked tough on immigration and crime and taken on the Police Federation. And she is popular with Tory activists, consistently occupying either first or second place in ConservativeHome's online polls on future party leaders. There have long been claims of Mrs May positioning herself for the top job, with reported tensions between her and the prime minister. Critics say she lacks charisma and micro-manages - while some cannot forget her coining the now infamous ""nasty party"" phrase at a Tory conference in 2002, but supporters say she is a formidable operator, and have dubbed her Britain's Angela Merkel. Latest odds: 9/2What's she said? ""My view is very simple, David Cameron is a first class leader of the party and a first class prime minister and I hope he is going to be doing that for a very long time."" (Desert Island discs, 23 November 2014)Claim? The blonde bombshell and mayor of London who can seemingly reach voters that others in the party cannot. Casting aside a rather chequered past he steered the capital through the 2012 Olympics, launched the successful and popular ""Boris bikes"" and got rid of London's ""bendy buses"" in favour of the new Routemaster double deckers. Mr Johnson hopes to revive his Westminster parliamentary career at the general election. He has been tipped by many to take the helm of the Conservative Party, and has not discouraged the idea. Like Theresa May, he is also a favourite among the grassroots of the party, pipping her to the top spot in ConservativeHome's latest poll of party members on future leaders. (he's ahead by 2 points). Critics say the gaffe-prone politician is not the right man for the job, but his supporters point to his wide-spread appeal.Latest odds: 9/4What's he said? ""I think what David Cameron is saying is banal and obvious. There has already been a leader of the Conservative Party for ten years and he's done an outstanding job. What he's saying now is that he wants to serve through to 2020 and that is frankly what we need him to do... five more years is what this country needs. I'm not entirely certain I see what the story is. He was asked a straight question, are you going to serve a third term like Mrs Thatcher or Tony Blair and he said no, because he thinks that ten years on top of British politics is an incredibly long time.""Claim? A self-made millionaire and devotee of Margaret Thatcher, he is regarded as one of the Conservatives' fastest-rising stars. The Treasury minister-turned-culture secretary became the first of the 2010 intake of MPs to reach cabinet level, and the first Asian male Conservative cabinet minister. He's currently polling well among the Conservative grassroots, who voted him third most preferable leader in ConservativeHome's latest online future leader poll. David Cameron recently said he wants to see a British Asian prime minister in his lifetime.Latest odds: 12/1Claim? Currently holding one of the four great offices of state - foreign secretary - Mr Hammond's name has often cropped up whenever talk of leadership contenders has emerged. He has built up an impressive CV in government since the Conservatives came to power in 2010, being first awarded the job of transport secretary before his promotion to defence secretary where he stayed for three years. He's regarded by many commentators as being a potential candidate for the Tory right. He seems to have work to do among party activists, scoring only 4% in ConservativeHome's future leader poll.Latest odds: 12/1"
2015-04-19,Cereal number,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-magazine-monitor-31962592,"David Cameron has declared he won't seek a third term as prime minister, citing an advertising slogan for Shredded Wheat used in the UK more than 30 years ago. What's its enduring power, asks Justin Parkinson.The hotel kitchen staff are in disbelief. Someone in room 147 has ordered three Shredded Wheat. The maid transports them upstairs to find England cricketer Ian Botham waiting at a table, dressed in full whites.The maid leaves. Botham hides one of the Shredded Wheat under a napkin and winks to camera. Cue music, as the slogan ""Shredded Wheat. Bet you can't eat three"" appears.This advert and others featuring football manager Brian Clough and the actor Richard Kiel, who played Jaws in James Bond films, have not run for some time. Nestle, which owns the brand, says the last probably aired in 1984.But their message seems to have waned little. Telling the BBC he would only serve a limited time in Downing Street, David Cameron said: ""Terms are like Shredded Wheat - two are wonderful but three might just be too many.""The prime minister's reprise was unlikely to be accidental, says Thayne Forbes, joint managing director of the brand-valuation company Intangible Business. ""Everybody would empathise with the view that three Shredded Wheat would probably be too much,"" he says. ""The slogan suggests people shouldn't overdo it. It sounds modest and reasoned.""As marketing goes, it might seem counter-intuitive, as it discourages excessive consumption. But it also sounds honest and unexploitative.Other advertising slogans and themes are in wide use in public and political discourse. Examples include Marmite being a by-word for divisiveness - a ""Marmite person"" is either loved or hated. Cameron has twice referred to Ronseal - the woodcare product that does ""exactly what it says on the tin"". But Shredded Wheat, its best-known slogan having lain dormant for so long, appears to be used less often. The cereal, created in the US in the 1890s, has long been sold as good for the evolving British lifestyle. A newspaper advert in 1902 described it as ""a relief from the monotony of everlasting porridge"", while, by 1943, it was ""an ideal food for all war workers"". The 1980s saw an emphasis on ""simple, honest goodness"", while, in the 2000s, its long heritage and reliability was promoted.""It's a good association for Cameron,"" says Forbes. ""He must have been brought up on it, like lots of other people. It will be great marketing for Shredded Wheat to have the slogan used after so many years, too.""Subscribe to the BBC News Magazine's email newsletter to get articles sent to your inbox"
2015-04-19,Are you 'cosmopolitan'?,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32021853,"The rise of UKIP heralds the emergence of a new divide in British politics, with cosmopolitan voters on one side and non-cosmopolitan ones on the other, argues Jeremy Cliffe.We hear a lot about UKIP these days. The party stole the show at the local and European elections last year, then again in the autumn when it lured two Conservative MPs to defect.  In the past weeks alone there have been three much-discussed television programmes about the party: ""Meet the Ukippers"", ""Farage Fans and UKIP Lovers"" and ""100 Days of UKIP"". At the upcoming general election the party will probably increase its share of seats in Westminster - and will certainly affect the results in dozens of other constituencies by taking votes from the other parties. But ask some of those academics who have been watching UKIP's rise, and they will tell you that it is just one part of a bigger story. We are all used to the left-right divide in politics: a spectrum of different views on how much the government should tax, spend, regulate and otherwise intervene in the economy. But according to Dr Rob Ford of Manchester University, UKIP exists on a different axis, one to do with cultural rather than economic matters. This new political scale is ever more prominent in British political life.Radio 4's Analysis programmeOn the one end of it is what you might call a ""cosmopolitan"" philosophy: a relaxed, liberal attitude to issues concerning national identity (like immigration) and to questions of morality and lifestyle (like gay marriage). On the other end is a ""non-cosmopolitan"" outlook: more nationalist, socially conservative and less comfortable with social change, or in other words the ideological stance often associated with typical UKIP voters. This divide cuts across the left-right scale: there are cosmopolitan and non-cosmopolitan voters in both the Conservative and the Labour camps, which is why UKIP takes support from both.Lots of things are making this cosmopolitanism divide more important. One is that the old class-based, ideological conflict between left and right has declined. Dr James Tilley of Oxford University argues that politicians are partly to blame. The economic philosophies of the Conservative and Labour parties are so similar, he argues, that other, cultural issues are becoming more important. Another factor is the growing gap between the generations: the difference in outlook between the cosmopolitan young and less cosmopolitan, older voters is greater than it was in the past (partly due to the recent rise in levels of university education, which tend to correlate with liberal views). This trend presents the established parties with some difficult questions. As Dr Ford puts it, they ""have to try and deal with this rising value divide, particularly now that UKIP has mobilised it into the political debate."" ""They have to make a move,"" he adds, ""but any move that they make risks making their position worse with one or the other of these groups of voters."" Sound too cosmopolitan, and the parties risk losing supporters to UKIP. Try to ""out-UKIP UKIP"", and they could alienate their younger, more socially liberal supporters. So both are doing the political splits, trying to reconcile the cosmopolitans within their ranks with the non-cosmopolitans. Witness the tortuous attempts by Ed Miliband to sound tough on immigration without sounding too tough. Witness, too, the recent struggles of David Cameron to persuade social conservatives in his party that gay marriage can be an innately conservative institution. In the long-term, this divide will become less problematic. That is because over the years the country will tilt towards the cosmopolitan end of this new spectrum. So says Penny Young of NatCen, the research organisation that conducts the extensive British Social Attitudes survey. Various demographic factors explain this trend. The country as a whole is becoming more accepting of same-sex relationships. Younger voters are more relaxed about things like immigration and national identity than were previous generations when they were young, suggesting that the overall population will tilt in an internationalist direction over time. And ever more parts of the country are acquiring the ethnic and social diversity once confined to the inner cities, a trend that generally makes people more comfortable with immigration. According to Dr Ford the question is therefore: how should the main political parties navigate this period of transition? It would be wrong to simply abandon the swathes of voters at the less cosmopolitan end of the scale; voters who are usually older and more isolated than the average member of the population.Yet the politicians do need to adapt to the changing attitudes of British society and be honest with voters rather than pandering to views that, deep down, they do not share. This quandary may not decide the upcoming general election, but in the established parties savvy strategists with an eye to elections in 2020 and beyond are grappling with it nonetheless. That is a wise move."
2015-04-19,Dudley debate,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32015334,"I met Afzal Amin for the first time on Friday, but I already knew who he was. In Dudley North, the seat he was selected by the Conservatives to fight in the general election, Mr Amin had become hard to avoid. When I first looked at the local newspaper online, the pages were surrounded by ""Amin"" logos in the preferred Tory shade of blue.Not long after we met, he asked me to pose for a photo, snapped by one of his campaign team, and doubtless rapidly tweeted out to followers of the would-be MP.Perhaps no surprise that the man running such a disciplined operation has served in the army and been to Sandhurst. That was very much the message he delivered on Friday, as he addressed school and college pupils at a hustings in Dudley which I'd been invited to chair.There was combative debate, too, not least with his Labour rival, the MP Ian Austin. Both men knew the Dudley contest was critical for their respective parties; Ian Austin held the seat by just over 600 votes in 2010. Just as David Cameron was denied a majority by failing to take seats like this one, so Ed Miliband is unlikely to be in No 10 if Labour loses Dudley North.He was self-confident and fluent. The only obvious mis-step came right at the end, when he interrupted Vicky Duckworth, the Green candidate for the neighbouring seat. She expressed the opinion that politics often seemed to be about men shouting at each other; Mr Amin complained she was engaging in gender bias.A few weeks ago, one Conservative MP who knows him well and respects his talents, said Afzal Amin had warned him of the risks of over-confidence. He thought he risked running before he could walk.Well, he stumbled badly this weekend. Whatever the purpose of his contacts with the English Defence League - and he strongly disputes claims that he wanted them to hold a protest that would then be called off, for which he could then take the credit - the exposure has damaged him and, potentially, the prospects of his party re-taking the seat.In February, the EDL staged a rally against plans for a new mosque in the town. As the Mail on Sunday story makes clear, Afzal Amin pleaded with them beforehand not to hold that demonstration; but it went ahead anyway. It's what happened subsequently which will feature in Tuesday's disciplinary hearing.Over the weekend, I put his defence to a very senior Conservative source - that this was an attempt to broker a compromise in order to bring together a divided community. The arch response: Dudley isn't Kandahar.Nor do I think from my visits to the town, where I'm going to be based for the general election, will people in Dudley appreciate being painted as somewhere riven by racial discord.True, Dudley was the scene of one of England's earliest race riots. But that was in 1962. Although the controversy over replacing the mosque - currently in a converted school and inadequate for the numbers who want to worship there - has been running for a decade, community relations are generally good. Even those who don't want a new mosque didn't want the EDL protestors - nor to be fair the anti-fascist counter-demonstrators who followed them.As for the Conservative Party, the view of the national leadership is that you don't collaborate with the EDL. Not least because the Tories are still struggling to bury some historic baggage in the Black Country: Enoch Powell was an MP in Wolverhampton when he delivered his Rivers of Blood speech about immigration in 1968.Four years before that, there was the notorious election in Smethwick which the Conservatives were accused of winning by wooing white voters with an offensive rhyme suggesting who'd they'd get as a neighbour if they voted Labour. Afzal Amin grew up in Smethwick so he should be aware of that history. He was, until his suspension on Saturday, one of about 17% of Conservative parliamentary candidates who are not white. The party is proud of that, but it's still struggling to translate that into votes.Afzal Amin may believe that he can persuade the party to lift the suspension when he meets party officials on Tuesday. I have my doubts. Even if they accept his defence, will the other parties be so charitable? The allegations would follow him on the campaign trail, and make planned visits by cabinet ministers next to impossible.On Friday, just before the hustings in Dudley began, Afzal Amin gave me his business card. It introduces him as 'prospective member of Parliament Dudley North'. I think I'll keep it; it could yet become a collector's item."

2015-04-20,Bid to change Speaker election rules,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32061097,"A last-minute bid to change the way the Speaker of the House of Commons is elected is to be debated by MPs.Labour criticised the government motion, to be debated on the final day before the dissolution of Parliament, saying the Conservatives were ""trying to play politics with the speakership"".Under the proposals, a secret ballot would decide whether there should be a contested election for the post.MPs currently have to file through the division lobbies to cast their vote.This means it is clear who does or does not back the incumbent as Speaker.Labour's shadow leader of the Commons Angela Eagle raised the party's concerns in the House on Wednesday evening, questioning whether the motion was within parliamentary rules.Current Speaker John Bercow is - technically - one of them, but many Tory MPs have never liked him.They resent his personal style and some believe he is far from impartial in the way he conducts business in the Commons.Attempts by some to force a vote on his resumption as Speaker in 2010 came to nothing. There have been the occasional measured jibes at him from the prime minister. Other Tories reportedly went much further and formed a group whose members had all been reprimanded by him. But the Speaker is a reformer who believes passionately that the people who elect the members, and pay the bills, should come first.The last act of the coalition looks like being an attempt to unseat him. And they are very serious about it.One Tory MP fighting an important marginal seat had been cleared by his party to be away from Parliament but he is now staying for the vote, such is the importance of it.She told Deputy Speaker Lindsay Hoyle: ""It's just come to my attention that the government has tabled a motion for debate on the final day of this Parliament, with no notice whatsoever to myself as shadow leader of the House, proposing changes to the way in which the Speaker of this House is elected.""Procedural matters in this House, with no consultation with the opposition, no consultation with the chair of the committee itself, for debate in only one hour tomorrow.""Mr Hoyle said the motion had been ""rightly or wrongly"" agreed to on Tuesday, saying that ""business of the House is decided by the government, not by the chair.""A spokesman for Commons Leader William Hague said the motion had been tabled as a free hour had opened up in Thursday's business after the House of Lords approved the Modern Slavery Bill.The proposed change would apply when a Speaker wishes to continue in the post after a general election.Under the current rules, if the Speaker's re-appointment is objected to, a division is held, with MPs choosing to back or oppose the Speaker in the division lobbies.The replacement of this method with a secret ballot was suggested in 2010 by a committee of MPs, which said the public method ""can be seen as a deterrent to the House expressing its views honestly"".MPs will now debate whether this change should be made."

2015-04-20,MPs warn on growth of UK jihadists,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32059813,"Not enough is being done to prevent people leaving the UK to join Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, a group of MPs has warned.Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said Britain must win their ""hearts and minds"".The committee's report comes as the BBC launches a database tracking British jihadists in Syria and Iraq. It shows that many people left in clusters from certain UK areas - often due to friendships and peer groups. The MPs' report argued that preventative work with communities, families and international partners was ""vital"" and needs to be a top priority for the Home Office.  ""The number of cases being brought to public attention should ring alarm bells,"" said Labour MP Mr Vaz.  ""This must be a relentless battle for hearts and minds, and without a strong counter-narrative we are in danger of failing to prevent even more departures. We are at the edge of a cliff."" The BBC has been tracking the stories of the men, women, boys and girls who have gone to Syria and Iraq to understand why they go, where they go from and what happens to them. By analysing around 160 profiles, it reveals the way in which people have travelled in clusters - a group of three young friends from Coventry, another group from Portsmouth, drawn out by one person they knew, others in Cardiff linked to people involved in an extremist organisation. Social media might play a part but face-to-face contact appears just as, if not more, important, according to the database.It includes the stories of: The BBC research emphasises the extent to which real-world contacts, rather than just online connections, are often a key driver of radicalisation and intent to travel to Iraq and Syria. Some of the experts who appeared before the Home Affairs Committee also argued the internet was a secondary influence. They said that universities and prisons were among the two most significant places where radicalisation occurred. A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police, which was not aware of the report, said it would have ""welcomed the opportunity"" to have given evidence to the committee and that it planned to look at the report in detail.The disappearance of schoolgirls Shamima Begum, Amira Abase, both 15, and Kadiza Sultana, 16, from east London in February, raised questions as to who could have done more to prevent their departure. After taking evidence from the police and the families of the girls among others, Mr Vaz said their case suffered from a ""lack of immediate action"". He added: ""Schools and the police must inform parents immediately, and work with them even if there is the smallest hint of radicalisation, or a close association with someone who is thought to have been radicalised.""However, the Met Police spokesman defended the speed of the police response to the schoolgirls' disappearance.  He said the committee's criticism was ""misleading"", pointing to the evidence given by both UK and Turkish authorities of ""rapid exchanges"" between the two.The committee's report said there needed to be an advice service which would be a less extreme step than calling the anti-terrorist hotline.The Association of Chief Police Officer's lead officer for the government's anti-terror strategy Prevent, Chief Constable Sir Peter Fahy, agreed that more needed to be done.However, he said the police ""do not have the capacity"" to routinely work with every school in the country.He added: ""The police service will play its part but the prime responsibility for dissuading young people from getting involved in extremist activity has to lie with parents, families and carers.""The committee also pointed to weaknesses in information sharing with airlines and other countries. It said greater care needed to be taken at airport check-in desks when people were travelling to destinations of concern - namely Syria, Somalia, Iraq and Nigeria, as well as neighbouring countries, such as Turkey. The report said police also needed to work faster to alert overseas partners and airlines when there were concerns over individuals.There were signs that some of the girls had followed extremist accounts on social media, the report said.The committee said that social media companies, such as Facebook and Twitter, should be prepared to suspend accounts when there is evidence they are being used to promote violent extremism.  The report also said it was disappointed the Home Office had not implemented a programme for individuals returning to Britain where there is evidence they had fought in Syria.Security officials estimate that some 600 Britons have left the country to join IS - and while around half may have returned, many are still out there - and some have died.  The BBC project includes detailed profiles of individuals which can be searched, based on hometown, age and gender, as well as those who have been convicted in the courts or who are believed to have been killed."

If not, the prince's private letters will either remain confidential, as the sender intended, or they'll be exposed to a large and inquisitive audience.

That will be a clear pledge from us.""He accused Mr Cameron of making an ""out of the blue, panicky"" announcement on VAT that ""no one in Britain will believe"".Labour, which has already announced plans to increase the top rate of income tax and impose a new ""mansion tax"" on high value properties, insists its plans are fully costed and will not require additional tax hikes if it wins May's general election.Mr Miliband began his final head-to-head encounter with Mr Cameron before the election by joking that the PM had ""announced his retirement plans"" - a reference to a BBC interview in which the prime minister said he would not serve a third term if the Tories remained in power.Challenging Mr Cameron to give a ""straight answer to a straight question"", Mr Miliband pressed him on whether he would rule out a rise in VAT after the election, as Labour had done.In response, the prime minister immediately said ""yes"", prompting loud cheers in turn from the Conservative benches. He contrasted what he said was a ""clear promise"" with Labour's unwillingness to rule out a rise in National Insurance.""I answered a very simple question about VAT. I ruled out an increase... straight answer to him, straight question from me. I have ruled out VAT. Will he rule out national insurance contributions. Yes or no?"" Mr Cameron added: ""We all know this is Labour's job tax. This is their tax of choice. This is what they clobber working people, families and enterprises with.""But Mr Miliband responded by saying there was ""only one person who is going to raise taxes on working families and that is him"".He said nobody would believe Mr Cameron on VAT ""because of his extreme spending plans, because his numbers do not add up and because he promised it last time and broke his promise"".Mr Cameron, he added, had broken other promises made before the last election to reduce annual net migration below 100,000 and not to pursue a major structural re-organisation of the NHS, adding that it was ""time for a better plan and time for a Labour government"".But Mr Cameron suggested a future Labour government would result in the ""chaos of economic crisis"", with Ed Miliband being ""held hostage"" by the SNP.The packed session provided a last opportunity for the two men to rally their MPs and set out their arguments before the start of the election campaign next week.Speaking after the exchanges and the other parties' tax pledges, deputy prime minister Nick Clegg said the Lib Dems ""don't need to raise VAT, national insurance or headline rates of income tax or corporation tax either"".""There are other taxes and other tax loopholes that we can increase or close in order to balance the books,"" he said.

2015-04-20,Met police 'had files on MPs in 90s',https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32044580,"A former undercover police officer has told BBC News that Scotland Yard kept intelligence files on MPs during the 1990s. Ex-Special Branch officer Peter Francis says he saw files on 10 Labour MPs which he and others regularly updated. He says he personally gathered information on three MPs as part of his work infiltrating left-wing groups. The MPs named, and Labour, have called for a forthcoming public inquiry into undercover policing to be widened. Mr Francis operated undercover between 1993 and 1997 in the Met's now disbanded Special Demonstration Squad. He was told to embed himself in left-wing groups or causes that were deemed to pose a potential threat to security. He says that during this period he was told to gather intelligence on MPs and their activities if and when they featured in any of his operations. That information, he says, was added to a special pink file that was available for Special Branch officers to read. Between 1990 and 2001, he claims to have personally seen records relating to Diane Abbott, the late Tony Benn, Jeremy Corbyn, the late Bernie Grant, Peter Hain, Harriet Harman, Ken Livingstone, Joan Ruddock, Dennis Skinner and Jack Straw.Four of the group became ministers during Mr Francis's time in Special Branch - including Jack Straw who was home secretary after 1997. ""When I was deployed undercover in the Special Demonstration Squad, any MP that I came across, such as on demonstrations, I would report back on them,"" he said. Mr Francis says that the files not only contained the MPs' publicly-stated political views - but also intelligence on what was going on behind the scenes in the party or their group. He says some of the information would have been things said in private by the MP, depending on how close each undercover officer had been able to get. Mr Francis said that when he first saw the files he understood that each had probably been created before the individual was an MP because of their personal involvement in radical causes or protests.But he added: ""When they became MPs these files carried on. It [was] your duty as an SDS officer to report back any intelligence that you come across. ""I felt that it was OK to report back on MPs,"" he said. ""I used to give myself a pat on the back, thinking 'I have done a good job'. These MPs were spied on and they should know.""""I don't think the police force should be monitoring MPs, full stop. I don't think we have any right to do that at all. It may be justifiable to say that the Security Service should be doing it - but I certainly don't think the police should be doing it.""Scotland Yard has refused to comment on the substance of the claims, but a spokesman said it had not shied away from serious allegations about the SDS. It said that Operation Herne, the internal police investigation into what happened in the unit, remained an ongoing investigation.""Operation Herne maintains that without speaking to Peter Francis it is simply not possible to fully investigate allegations he makes,"" said a spokesman. ""Operation Herne remains very willing to engage with him.""Mr Francis said that he has refused to speak to Operation Herne because he fears being interviewed under caution as a suspect, rather than a whistleblower. Scotland Yard told the BBC that Operation Herne detectives would be prepared to speak to him as a witness. He has, however, spoken to Mark Ellison QC who reviewed allegations about the SDS for the Home Secretary Theresa May - prompting her to launch a statutory inquiry. He says he will appear before those hearings. Peter Hain, who was a leader of the anti-apartheid movement in the late 1960s and 70s and became an MP in 1991, said he now wants full answers from Scotland Yard. ""I was deeply disturbed to find that files were still being kept by the Special Branch while I and others were serving Members of Parliament,"" he said. ""That is constitutionally an outrage. It infringes the sovereignty of Parliament. ""I want to see the home secretary widen the scope of the inquiry into the SDS to look specifically at the surveillance of MPs and the fact that there were active files on us while we were serving Members of Parliament. ""This should never have happened and it should have been reported and properly authorised - and we don't know whether it was.""Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper echoed the call for the inquiry to be widened in light of what she described as ""extremely serious and disturbing allegations"".""While undercover policing remains a crucial tool in combating serious and organised crime it must not be abused,"" she said.""There have now been a series of serious allegations about undercover policing - ranging from the treatment of Stephen Lawrence's family to police having long-term inappropriate relationships. ""We called some time ago for much stronger oversight of undercover policing and it is also vital to get to the truth about what has happened."" Mrs May announced earlier this month that Lord Justice Pitchford would lead the inquiry into the SDS allegations - but the precise shape of that inquiry is not yet clear.A Home Office spokesman said the review by Mark Ellison QC had unearthed ""serious historical failings"". ""That is why the Home Secretary established a public inquiry to thoroughly investigate undercover policing and the operation of the Special Demonstration Squad. ""Lord Justice Pitchford will consult interested parties to the inquiry over the coming months on setting the terms of reference, with a view to publishing these at the end of July.""Undercover policing is an essential tactic in the fight against crime but to improve the public's confidence in undercover work we must ensure there is no repeat of these failings in the future."""
2015-04-20,NHS problems worst 'since 1990s',https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/health-32057948,"Services in the NHS in England are deteriorating in a way not seen since the early 1990s, according to a leading health think tank. The King's Fund review said waiting times for A&E, cancer care and routine operations had all started getting worse, while deficits were growing.It said such drops in performance had not been seen for 20 years.But the think tank acknowledged the NHS had done as well as could be expected, given the financial climate.Professor John Appleby, chief economist at the King's Fund, which specialises in health care policy, said: ""The next government will inherit a health service that has run out of money and is operating at the very edge of its limits. ""There is now a real risk that patient care will deteriorate as service and financial pressures become overwhelming.""He said in terms of how standards were slipping - not how low they had reached - the situation was the worst it had been since the ""early 1990s"".The report noted much of the deterioration has happened in the second-half of the Parliament with many measures of performance being maintained in the first few years.It said the next government had to address the funding situation, adding the extra £8bn a year NHS England says is needed by 2020, was the ""minimum"" that would be required.The report - a review of performance this Parliament - highlights a range of problems as well as achievements. These include:The report is the second part of the King's Fund pre-election review of the NHS this Parliament.Last month it warned the coalition government's reforms of the health service had been ""damaging and distracting"".The King's Fund report should make worrying reading. The reference to the 1990s conjures up images of - for the NHS at least - a bygone era. The think tank's point was not that waiting times had reached the level they were at then, rather that this is the first time in two decades of almost continuous improvement that there has been a sustained drop in performance.In many ways, that had to happen. Services cannot keep getting better for ever. Nonetheless, the findings are crystal clear: the NHS is at a critical juncture. But what is less easy to determine is to what extent the coalition's policies have contributed to the difficulties.The think tank has already provided a critical analysis of the government's reforms - and when pushed, acknowledged the health service may have been ""in better shape"" if they had not happened.But the more significant issue for the health of the health service this Parliament has been the squeeze on finances. Even though the budget has been increased, it has felt more like a cut to many because demands have risen so quickly.On this though, the King's Fund accepted that the government's hands were tied. Given the state of the economy, ministers did as much as they could have.Read more from NickRoyal College of Nursing general secretary Peter Carter said politicians needed to take note of the warnings made by the King's Fund.""Morale is low, and more and more staff are being made sick with stress because of the intolerable pressure they are under,"" he added. Katherine Murphy, of the Patients Association, said: ""The findings echo what we are hearing on a daily basis on our helpline. It is clear to the public that the future of the NHS is one of the most important issues facing the nation and it should be a central issue in the election campaign.""Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham said: ""Five years ago David Cameron stood on a promise to protect the NHS. This report provides authoritative proof that he has broken that promise.""But a Department of Health spokesman said: ""As the King's Fund says, the NHS has 'performed well in the face of huge challenges', but if we are to continue to invest in the NHS going forward it needs to be backed by a strong economy.""

2015-04-20,SNP 'could block Tory government',https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32045419,"The SNP would block a minority Conservative government by voting down its Queen's Speech if it holds the post-election balance of power, its former leader Alex Salmond has said.Mr Salmond said the move could bring down the government if Labour joined in, with David Cameron ""locked out"".The Conservatives accused him of ""trying to sabotage the democratic will of the British people"".Labour has called his balance of power prediction ""bluster and bluff"".In recent days Mr Salmond, who is bidding to become a Westminster MP at the 7 May general election, has claimed his party could ""hold the power"" in a hung Parliament and would be able to influence the Budget of a minority Labour government.This was dismissed by Labour leader Ed Miliband, who has ruled out a formal coalition with the Scottish nationalists.The SNP currently has six MPs at Westminster, but recent opinion polls suggest its share could increase dramatically at the general election.James Cook, BBC News Scotland correspondentIf the Conservatives attempt to form a minority government and enough MPs vote against their Queen's Speech the administration would fall at the first hurdle and the leader of the opposition would have a shot at forming a government.That's how parliamentary democracy works in the event of a hung Parliament.And yet the Conservatives are saying that by planning to vote against a government he opposes Alex Salmond has ""confirmed he would sabotage the democratic will of the British people in order to make Ed Miliband prime minister"".It is part of their continuing attempt to portray Mr Miliband as a weak leader whose strings are being pulled by Mr Salmond.This kind of language causes despair among Tories north of the border who fear that the party in London is waltzing into an SNP trap.They know that many voters in Scotland will read the phrase ""democratic will of the British people"" and hear ""democratic will of the English people"".Because, if it is illegitimate for Scottish MPs, from whatever party, to vote against one government and support another in the British parliament, then what, voters may ask, is the point of the union?Who is dancing to Mr Salmond's tune now?Mr Salmond, the former Scottish first minister, told the New Statesman that in the event of a hung Parliament, a minority Conservative government would have to ""go straight effectively for a vote of confidence - usually the Queen's Speech, although it could be otherwise, of course - and we'd be voting against.""If David Cameron lost this vote, he said, there would be a two-week period for another government to be formed.BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said Mr Salmond had ""hardened his anti-Conservative rhetoric"" in the interview.A Conservative spokesman said:  ""Alex Salmond has confirmed he would sabotage the democratic will of the British people in order to make Ed Miliband prime minister. ""That would mean chaos for Britain, with weak Ed Miliband dancing to Alex Salmond's tune.""He said the ""only way to keep Britain together"" was to vote Conservative.Mr Salmond's latest comments come after Mr Miliband said the only people writing a future Labour Budget would be himself and shadow chancellor Ed Balls.Speaking in Clydebank on Monday, he added: ""It's not going to be Alex Salmond - not in a million years."""
2015-04-20,MPs criticise 'lack of EU debate',https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32045290,"The government's ""failure"" to let MPs debate EU legislation is ""deplorable"", a Parliamentary committee says.The European Scrutiny Committee said ministers had refused to schedule debates on issues such as free movement and the EU's Budget.It also said BBC coverage of EU matters should be ""improved substantially"".The government said the number of EU debates had doubled since 2009-10, while the BBC said its coverage was ""extensive and impartial"".The cross-party committee's role includes scrutinising EU documents and recommending the most important for debate in the House of Commons.Its report said in the period covering most of the 2014-15 financial year there were three debates on the floor of the House, compared with 12 in 2013-14.It also pointed out that not a single debate had taken place during a nine-month period, between 9 June 2014 and 9 March 2015.""The government's collective failure to schedule so many debates on EU documents over the past year is deplorable, and is a discourtesy to this committee and to all members of the House,"" the MPs said.Prime Minister David Cameron has sought to rally support from other EU leaders for his plans to curb welfare payments to European migrants ahead of a referendum on the UK's membership if he wins the general election.The committee said the government's ""cavalier"" approach was ""at odds with UK ministers' claims in their speeches across the EU about the role of national parliaments"".The Foreign Office said the government was committed to a ""strong EU scrutiny system that enables Parliament to hold it to account for the decisions taken in Brussels"".It added: ""We have made good on our commitment to raise standards by doubling the number of Europe debates on the floor of the House since 2009-10.""This government has also increased by around a fifth since 2010 the number of EU proposals that have been scrutinised and cleared by Parliament before being agreed in Brussels.""The committee has also been examining the BBC's coverage of European issues, taking evidence from director general Lord Hall and head of news James Harding earlier this month.During that appearance, Lord Hall said the desire for balanced output ""ran deep"" within the BBC and he believed that this was being achieved.Mr Harding said if the public was going to trust the BBC to report on politicians impartially it had to be clear that BBC journalists weren't ""asked by politicians to come and account for what they do and in effect do the bidding of those politicians"".But the committee said it was ""concerned about the manner in which the BBC treats EU issues"", calling for coverage to be ""improved substantially"".It suggested coverage did not reflect all sides of the debate on the European Union, and more analysis was needed. Its chairman, Conservative MP Sir William Cash, said the BBC had ""very particular obligations"" to be impartial and to ""educate and inform"".He added:  ""We do not believe this is currently being achieved in the context of the BBC's EU coverage.""A BBC spokesman said the corporation provided extensive and impartial coverage of European and Parliamentary issues, and it would be a breach of the corporation's independence if a committee of MPs instructed the BBC on its coverage."
2015-04-20,Lobbyists must 'conform' with rules,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32047992,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe woman in charge of the government's new register of lobbyists has said she expects the industry to ""conform"" with the statutory system. Speaking ahead of the register's launch, Alison White conceded a lot of lobbyists would not be listed on it.But she said her job was to make sure the rules were implemented and she would do so with ""extreme verve and vigour.""But one critic of the register said it was ""fake"" and full of ""loopholes"".Lobbyists are companies or individuals paid to influence government decisions.The coalition promised to introduce a statutory register of lobbyists when it came to power in 2010, and legislation was passed last year, with ministers saying the move would help clean up politics.However, the new register will only cover consultant lobbyists and will not apply to lobbyists working ""in-house"" for companies or organisations.A person or company will only need to be registered if they are contacting a government minister or permanent secretary in a government department - leading to criticism it will not come close to reflecting the scale or nature of lobbying that goes on across Whitehall.But Ms White, who is independent of the government, said her task was to implement the law as it stood not to question the powers she had been given. ""We are having something that has never been in place before,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""This is a statutory register. The industry tells me it is a professional industry. I expect them to conform with the legislation. It is my job to make sure they do so.""Ms White, who was appointed as the registrar of consultant lobbyists in September, acknowledged the register would not indicate different ""levels of lobbying"".""The legislation was quite narrowly drafted to address a particular issue, which was that it was not always particularly clear, when ministers were being lobbied, who the client of the lobbyist was. That is what the register was set up to do,"" she said.She added: ""This will give anyone who wishes to access the register the opportunity to be able to see who is lobbying and being paid for it and who their clients are. That is the main information the register will contain.""If a lobbyist sets out to influence government policy in some way, they would have to be registered. If they are not registered, then they would not be conforming. They have to go on the register before they lobby.""Ms White said last month that the register would not have any entries on its launch day but she had received more than ""20 expressions of interest"" about joining and companies and individuals might be required to sign up retrospectively.Potential registrants will be able to log on and create an account to file an ""information return"".But Tamasin Cave, from the Alliance for Lobbying Transparency coalition, said ""hardly anyone"" in the industry would be covered by the provisions of the new law. ""You have a huge commercial lobbying industry, and very few of them will have to sign up,"" she told Today.""The second flaw is that it won't show the interaction between lobbyists and government, and that is what a register is for.""It is to show the activity - who is discussing what with whom, but this shows nothing of this interaction. It is a fake register."""
2015-04-20,Car smoking ban MSP welcomes backing,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-south-scotland-32055226,"The Liberal Democrat MSP behind a bill to ban smoking in cars when children are present has welcomed the support of the Scottish government.South of Scotland MSP Jim Hume launched the members' bill in December.The government said it was ""very supportive"" of the principles of the bill, but changes could be needed to make it ""workable"".Motorists could potentially be fined £100 for breaching the rule if it becomes law.Mr Hume lodged draft proposals for a bill last May calling for a ban in Scotland on smoking in private vehicles when children under 18 were present.He said he was ""over the moon"" at the news the Scottish government would endorse the Smoking Prohibition (Children in Motor Vehicles) (Scotland) Bill.He said: ""With cross-party support and the support of many third sector organisations, there is every chance that this could be in place in the next year.""Eighty-four per cent of the 160 responses to my consultation were positive and people from across Scotland have expressed their support for the move.""The bill is about guaranteeing that children in Scotland can have the freedom to go on and lead healthy lives if they choose to.""I look forward to working with MSPs from all parties as the bill progresses.""Public Health Minister Maureen Watt said the Scottish government had considered including the measure in its Public Health Bill, but instead decided to support Mr Hume's proposals.She said: ""As with any bill, as it goes through the scrutiny process, there may be amendments and improvements to strengthen the legislation and ensure it is fit for purpose. ""But we believe that the underpinning principles are strong, and that is why I am pleased to support it.""Scottish Labour and a wide range of health organisations have backed his proposals.But the Scottish Conservatives have reservations about how the bill would work in practice.The party's health spokesman Jackson Carlaw said: ""While Scottish Conservatives support any moves which would protect young people from hazardous second hand smoke we have concerns as to how this would be enforced.""It would be a better use of resources to conduct a public awareness campaign similar to that which is being proposed by the government in Wales.""We will be watching this campaign in order to ascertain what lessons may be learned and what approaches may be adopted in Scotland.""Anti-smoking campaigners welcomed the Scottish government's backing for Mr Hume's bill.ASH Scotland's chief executive Sheila Duffy said: ""It is another public health initiative that can help Scotland move forward with its ambition to achieve a tobacco-free generation in 20 years' time.""It is popular with the public and will bring Scotland into line with upcoming legislation in England and Wales.""We believe it can be effectively enforced and that having the legislation focus on cars with children bypasses concerns over interference in people's private lives.""Jim Hume must be congratulated for taking the initiative on this proposal and for all the hard work he and his team have done to bring this important measure forward.""But Simon Clark, director of the smokers' group Forest, said the bill was ""legislation for legislation's sake"".He said: ""Smoking in cars carrying children is inconsiderate. The overwhelming majority of smokers know that and don't do it.""The very small number that do will carry on regardless because the law will be difficult, if not impossible, to enforce.""Education has to be better than legislation but the government prefers gesture politics and the big stick."""
2015-04-20,Candidate quits over UKIP MEP remark,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32038485,"A UKIP election candidate has quit the party over comments made by the party's only Scottish MEP about a Scottish government minister.Tim Wilson has decided not to stand in South Northamptonshire after David Coburn MEP compared Humza Yousaf to convicted terrorist Abu Hamza.Mr Coburn has apologised for the remarks, saying it was a ""joke"".A spokesman for UKIP said Mr Wilson had failed to emphasise local issues in his general election campaign.UKIP leader Nigel Farage said Mr Coburn's remarks were a ""joke in poor taste"" but he would not be taking any action against him.But Mr Wilson said he was disillusioned with the party over the ""racist jibes"" and has decided to stand down.He told BBC Scotland he was appalled by Mr Coburn's comments about Mr Yousaf and frustrated by the inaction of the party's leadership on the issue.  He said David Coburn had produced ""what I can only describe as an Islamaphobic insult, and that's simply not acceptable"".  Mr Wilson added: ""Of course he went on and apologised.  I think, frankly, that if you are in a position of power you have to be able to control what ideas emerge from your head and how they get to your mouth and, in fact, you shouldn't have those ideas in the first place.  ""But the real issue is that when Mr Farage was asked what he thought about this he dismissed this as a joke.  ""I don't think this is a joke. I think this is something very serious.  It may not be that this man intended to cause offence but we aren't interested in what his intentions are.  We are interested in the effect what he says has on other people and the effect is catastrophic, it's appalling and I've resigned.""In his resignation letter, Mr Wilson said he had been ""systematically gagged by the party whip"" and forbidden to speak about Islam favourably. A spokesman for UKIP said Mr Wilson had failed to put more emphasis on local issues in his campaign.He said: ""Whilst we had initially been optimistic about Tim Wilson's abilities as a candidate, it became obvious in recent weeks that he was out of his depth in representing our party in the way we would expect. ""Mr Wilson had clearly misunderstood the expectations that UKIP place on all of its candidates. Principal amongst those is focusing on issues that are relevant to local voters. UKIP put huge emphasis on local issues and Mr Wilson was unwilling to follow UKIP guidelines in this respect.""Last week MSPs at the Scottish Parliament unanimously condemned the remarks made by Mr Coburn during a newspaper interview.MSPs were debating a motion celebrating Scotland's diverse communities.The president of the European Parliament, Martin Schulz, condemned the remarks, saying they were ""not worthy of any elected member"". But a spokesman for the president said he could not act on remarks made outside parliament.The move comes just days after another candidate, Jonathan Stanley, quit in protest at the ""racist filth"" in UKIP. Mr Stanley, who was due to stand in the Cumbrian seat of Westmorland and Lonsdale, was the party's former head of policy in Scotland."

2015-04-20,Manifesto watch,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-29642613,"Political parties are putting together their manifestos for May's general election. Here's a guide to where they currently stand on the issues voters say they care about most (according to pollsters IPSOS Mori).ImmigrationConservatives:  David Cameron wants to make migrants wait four years before they can claim certain benefits, such as tax credits, Universal Credit, or get access to social housing. He wants to stop migrants from claiming child benefit for dependents living outside the UK, and remove those that have failed to find work after six months. Mr Cameron has promised to put reform of EU free movement rules at the heart of his renegotiation of Britain's relationship with the EU. He has ruled out a temporary cap on migrant numbers or an ""emergency brake"" on EU freedom of movement rules - ideas both mooted in recent months, saying this would be less ""effective"" than reducing the incentives for people to come to the UK. The party has a continuing goal to bring net immigration down to below 100,000 people a year (it currently stands at 243,000).Labour: ""Stronger"" border controls to tackle illegal immigration with ""proper"" entry and exit checks. ""Smarter"" targets to reduce low-skilled migration but ensure university students and high-skilled workers are not deterred. Employment agencies who only recruit abroad will be outlawed while the fines for employing illegal immigrants will be increased.Lib Dems: Reintroduce exit checks at borders, so the government can identify people who are overstaying their visa. Will require all new claimants for Jobseekers Allowance to have their English language skills assessed, with JSA then being conditional on attending language courses for those whose English is poor. Ensure that EU migrants have to ""earn"" their entitlement to benefits.SNP: Allow the devolved government to have control over immigration to Scotland, and introduce a Canadian-style earned citizenship system to attract highly-skilled immigrants.Plaid Cymru: Oppose a points-based system. Support the right of asylum seekers to work in Wales while they wait for status decisions to be made. Lobby the Westminster government to ensure that they shut ""detention"" centres.UKIP: Introduce an Australian-style points policy, used to select migrants with the skills and attributes needed to work in the country - covering people from inside and outside the EU. Bring net immigration down to 50,000 people a year. Priority lanes for UK passport holders. Increase UK border staff by 2,500. Tougher English language tests for migrants seeking permanent residence. Opt out of the Dublin treaty to allow the UK to return asylum seekers to other EU countries without considering their claim. Anyone who currently has the legal right to live, work, or study in the UK would not face deportation in the event of the country's withdrawal from the EU.Greens:  Progressively reduce UK immigration controls. Migrants illegally in the UK for over five years will be allowed to remain unless they pose a serious danger to public safety. More legal rights for asylum seekers.Taxes and the economyConservatives: Eradicate the deficit by 2018 and secure an overall budget surplus by 2019-20. Achieve this by spending cuts, not tax rises, while raising NHS spending. An income tax cut for 30 million people by 2020. Tax would start to kick in at £12,500 a year, instead of £10,500. This will cost £5.6bn. The higher tax rate, 40%, would start at £50,000 instead of £41,900, again by 2020, at a cost of £1.6bn. This will be paid for through £25bn in additional spending cuts and economic growth. No increases in VAT.Labour: Get the current budget into surplus and the national debt falling ""as soon as possible in the next parliament"". No additional borrowing for new spending. Reintroduce the 50p top rate of income tax for earnings over £150,000.  Cut income tax for 24 million people by bringing back the 10p rate, paid for by scrapping the Married Couples' Tax Allowance. Bring in a ""mansion tax"" on properties worth over £2m, to raise £1.2bn. A tax on bankers' bonuses. A 5% pay cut for every government minister. Push for UK overseas territories to be put on an international blacklist if they refuse to co-operate with a drive against tax avoidance. No increases in VAT or National Insurance contributions.Lib Dems: Raise the personal allowance - the point at which you start paying income tax - to £11,000 in April 2016 and then to £12,500 by 2020. ""Strict new fiscal rules"" to ensure the deficit has gone by April 2018, with the wealthy contributing the most. The Lib Dems invented the ""mansion tax"" but in contrast to Labour have set out how it would operate - along similar lines to council tax bands. There are also Lib Dem plans to increase capital gains tax - paid on profits from second homes or shares - from 28% to 35%. Impose an additional 8% rate of corporation tax on UK banks to raise an extra £1bn a year to help pay off the deficit.SNP: Oppose UK plans in the Infrastructure Bill which will allow oil and gas drilling and hydraulic fracturing beneath people's homes without consent. Invest in offshore wind farming. Support an international bank tax and limits to industry bonuses.Plaid Cymru: Build a Green Skills Construction College, specialising in green energy. Establish a publicly-owned energy company. Establish a publicly-owned Bank of Wales business investment bank. Enforce a living wage. Give devolved nations an equal say in institutions that affect everyone's lives, such as the Bank of England.UKIP: Increase the personal allowance to the level of full-time minimum wage earnings, about £13,500, by 2020. Abolish inheritance tax. Introduce a 35% income tax rate between £42,285 and £55,000, at which point the 40% rate becomes payable. Set up a Treasury Commission to design a turnover tax on large businesses. Cut foreign aid budget by £9bn a year. Scrap HS2. Save £8bn a year in membership fees by leaving the EU.  Lower the VAT rate charged on restorations to listed buildings.Greens: People earning more than £100,000 a year would pay 50% income tax. Wealth tax of 1% to 2% on people worth £3m or more. Renationalise the railways and energy companies. Scrap HS2. Allow councils to impose extra business rates on out-of-town supermarkets to fund small local businesses. Crackdown on tax avoidance by multinationals. Allow ""the current dependence on economic growth to cease, and allow zero or negative growth to be feasible without individual hardship"". Commit Britain to a ""zero carbon"" future. Cut rail and bus fares by an average of 10%. Enforce a cap on bankers' bonuses.The NHSConservatives:  Chancellor George Osborne says he will put an extra £2bn into frontline health services across the UK, which he described as a ""down payment"" on a plan drawn up by NHS bosses calling for an extra £8bn a year above inflation by 2020. In England, everyone would be able to see a GP seven days a week by 2020. Recruit 5,000 more doctors.Labour:  Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said Labour would commit an extra £2.5bn a year above Mr Osborne's plan. The money will come from three sources - a new ""mansion"" tax, clamping down on tax avoidance by big corporations and a new tax on tobacco companies. Patients in England would get a GP appointment within 48 hours and would not have to wait longer than a week for cancer tests and results. Scrap the Health and Social Care Act and end ""creeping privatisation"" of the NHS.  Integrate health and social care services into a system of ""whole-person care"". Give greater priority to mental health services. Replace the Cancer Drugs Fund in England when it runs out in 2016 with a £330m fund to improve access to innovative cancer drugs, surgery and radiotherapy. Recruit 5,000 more healthcare workers to help patients stay in their homes and introduce new safety checks to identify people at risk of hospitalisation. Prioritise child mental health by increasing the proportion of the mental health budget spent on children.Lib Dems: An extra £1bn for the NHS every year, to be funded by - amongst other things - making higher earners pay more tax on their shares. Half of this will go towards mental health. Ensure that spending on the NHS rises in line with growth in the economy. People who need therapy for conditions such as depression will be guaranteed treatment within 18 weeks. For young patients experiencing psychosis for the first time treatment will be provided within two weeks of being referred by a GP. This is all going to happen from April, with more mental health targets to follow if the Lib Dems return to government. Wants a cross-party review of the future of NHS funding.SNP: Reduce the number of senior managers in the NHS by 25% over the next parliament. Streamline the work of health boards. Real terms increases in year-on-year NHS spending.Plaid Cymru: Recruit 1,000 extra doctors to the Welsh NHS over two terms of a Plaid government. Offer financial incentives for recruiting doctors to areas and specialisms where there are, or are predicted to be, shortages. Encourage innovation and attract more research funding, in part by increasing research and development funding as government finance allows. Improve training for postgraduate doctors and stop them being used to ""plug gaps"" in staff rotas. More recruitment from within the EU to fill vacancies and using international doctors to staff the NHS while a new generation of Welsh doctors are trained.UKIP: An extra £3bn per year in NHS funding paid for by quitting the EU and through ""middle management"" cuts. Keep NHS free at the point of delivery. Stop any further use of PFI, and encourage local authorities to buy out their PFI contracts early where it is affordable to do so. Ensure all visitors and migrants who have been here for fewer than five years have NHS-approved medical insurance as a condition of entry to UK, with £200m of the £2bn saved to be spent on ending hospital parking charges in England. Bring back state-enrolled nurses and return powers to matrons. Monitor and Care Quality Commission to be replaced with elected county health boards. Stop spending £90m a year on gastric band and breast enhancement operations.Greens: Funding to be diverted away from centralised facilities towards community healthcare, illness prevention and health promotion.  Stop privatisation. Abolish prescription charges. Dedicated NHS Tax to go direct to the health service. Ban proactive recruitment of non-British NHS staff from overseas. A complete ban on the promotion of tobacco and alcohol products, including sponsorship.Security, defence and foreign affairsConservatives: Hold a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU by 2017, after negotiating the return of some powers from Brussels. Protect foreign aid budget. Replace Trident.Labour:  Push for reform of European Union and prevent Britain from ""sleepwalking"" towards exit. Commit in law to holding a Strategic Defence and Security Review every 5 years. Outlaw discrimination and abuse of Armed Forces personnel.Lib Dems: Campaign to reduce the number of Trident nuclear submarines. Push for greater European Union efficiency. SNP: Oppose nuclear weapons and push for removal of Trident submarines from Scotland. In 2010, proposed a Scottish Centre for Reconciliation and Conflict Resolution, to promote peaceful alternatives to armed conflict. Maintain 0.7% commitment to foreign aid. Enhanced role for Scotland within the UK in Europe, particularly in fisheries policy.Plaid Cymru: Honour commitment of 0.7% of budget used for foreign aid. Campaign for cancellation of developing countries' debts. Support the Fair Trade movement. Support the 'Tobin' or 'Robin hood' tax as a means of encouraging more responsibility and stability in the global markets. Reform the IMF and World Bank in order to improve regulation and accountability. Continue membership of the EU, but campaign for democratic reform. Support minority nations and minority language speakers around the world. Pass a Military Wellbeing Act to promote and safeguard the physical and mental health and wellbeing of military personnel.UKIP:  Leave the European Union. Remove the passports of any person who has gone to fight for a terrorist organisation and deport anyone who has committed a terrorist act. Cut foreign aid budget by £9bn. Create a Veterans Department to look after the interests of ex-service men and women.Greens: Referendum on Britain's EU membership. Want reform of EU to hand powers back to local communities. Boost overseas aid to 1% of GDP within 10 years. Scrap Britain's nuclear weapons. Take the UK out of NATO unilaterally. End the so-called ""special relationship"" between the UK and the US.  Stop EU-US free trade deal TTIP. JobsConservatives: Create three million apprenticeships to be paid for by benefit cuts.Labour: Guarantee a job for under 25s unemployed for over a year and adults unemployed for more than two years. As many young people to go on an apprenticeship as currently go to university by 2025. Create a million new high technology, green jobs by 2025. Ban ""exploitative"" zero hour contracts.Lib Dems: An extra £1 an hour for the lowest paid apprentices. Campaign to create a million more jobs.SNP: Introduce gender quotas on public boards. Living wage ""a central priority"" in all Scottish government contracts. Continue the 'small business bonus'.Plaid Cymru: Provide rates relief for small businesses. Increase the number and value of contracts from Welsh public bodies that go to firms within Wales.UKIP: Allow firms to offer jobs to British workers first ""without the fear of being sued for discrimination"".Greens: A national energy conservation scheme to create thousands of new jobs. The party wants to create ""sustainable jobs"" and promotes more local production of food and goods.Education Conservatives: Protect England's schools budget - from reception entry at age four or five to the end of GCSEs at 16 - in cash terms although funding per pupil will not keep pace with inflation. Pre-school and post 16 education not ring fenced. Convert up to 3,500 more schools judged by Ofsted to ""require improvement"" into academies. ""War on illiteracy and innumeracy"". State primary schools in England that repeatedly failed to have a proportion of year-six pupil pass times tables and writing tests be forced to become academies, or have sponsorship replaced if already an academy. Opposed to giving votes to 16 and 17-year-olds for UK-wide general elections and local elections in England.Labour:  Increase the overall education budget in England, including schools, nurseries, Sure Start and provision for 16-to 18-year-olds, by at least the rate of inflation, although per-pupil funding is not specifically protected, meaning some of the increase will be eaten up by rising pupil numbers. Parents of primary school children would be guaranteed childcare from 8am to 6pm. The amount of free childcare for three and four year olds would be increased from 15 to 25 hours a week. Compulsory sex and relationship education in all schools. Refuse to grant business rate relief to independent schools unless they can show a ""meaningful impact"" on state schools through a new School Partnership Standard, for example by lending teaching staff or assisting in university admissions procedures. Committed to extending the franchise to 16 and 17-year-olds in elections across the UK. Double the number of Sure Start childcare places to more than 118,000. Tighten up the rules on primary school class sizes to ensure they do not have more than 30 pupils.Lib Dems: Protect the education budget from cuts. Guarantee qualified teachers and a core curriculum set by independent experts, as well as compulsory sex education, in all state schools including academies and free schools. More money for disadvantaged school children and free childcare for all two year olds. A two-thirds discount on all local bus fares for young people aged 16-21. Supports lowering the voting age to 16 in all UK elections.SNP: Guaranteed free 30 hours of childcare a week for three and four-year-olds in Scotland, up from 16 hours. Maintain lack of tuition fees at Scottish universities, and offer financial support in grants and loans to students. Continue to build and refurbish schools. Lower voting age to 16 in all UK elections.Plaid Cymru: Introduce a compulsory modern foreign language GCSE in secondary schools and the teaching of modern foreign languages in primary schools. Look at ways to strengthen the teaching of Welsh history and culture. Oppose foundation schools, academies and free schools. Look at moving from a per-pupil funding mechanism to a funding model based on the catchment area. Will not support any further increases in tuition fees for higher education students, and will seek the abolition of tuition fees as and when public finances allow. Supports lowering the voting age to 16 for elections to the Welsh Assembly and the UK Parliament.UKIP: More grammar schools. Scrap sex education for children aged under seven. Scrap tuition fees for students from poorer backgrounds who take degree courses in the sciences, technology, maths or engineering. Greater emphasis on vocational education with new Apprenticeship Qualification Option. School governing boards must be made up of at least 30% parents of children at the school. Allow universities to charge same amount for EU students as non-EU students.Greens: End performance related pay for teachers. Replace Ofsted with an independent National Council for Educational Excellence. Bring Free Schools and Academies into local authority control.

Withdraw Jobseeker's Allowance from young people after six months unless they take part in ""community projects"". And 18 to 21-year-olds wouldn't be entitled to housing benefit. Ban on zero-hours contracts which stop people getting work elsewhere. Raise the personal allowance - the point at which you start paying income tax - to £11,000 in April 2016 and then to £12,500 by 2020, which means that if you work on minimum wage for 30 hours you will pay no income tax. Young people out of work, education or training for six months will have to do unpaid community work to get benefits. This will apply to about 50,000 18 to 21-year-olds. Universal benefits for pensioners, such as free bus passes, TV licences for the over 75s and the winter fuel allowance. will once again be protected. Labour: Freeze energy prices until 2017. Increase in the minimum wage from £6.50-an-hour to £8-an-hour by 2020. Rises in child benefit capped at 1% for the first two years of the next parliament. Winter fuel allowance would be withdrawn from the wealthiest pensioners. Repeal what the government calls the spare room subsidy, dubbed the ""bedroom tax"" by Labour.  A million interest-free loans to help people insulate their homes. Rail fares would be capped. Double the amount of paid paternity leave available to new fathers from two to four weeks, and increase statutory paternity pay to £260 a week.Lib Dems: Raise the personal allowance - the point at which you start paying income tax - to £11,000 in April 2016 and then to £12,500 by 2020 (the Conservatives are promising the same thing). Nick Clegg has said he would not accept Conservative plans to freeze working-age benefits without taxing the rich too. He hasn't said he would block welfare cuts altogether. Withdraw eligibility for the Winter Fuel Payment and free TV Licence from pensioners on the 40% rate of income tax. A ""yellow card"" system to deal with benefit claimants breaking the rules, rather than imposing sanctions without warning.SNP: Oppose cuts to in-work benefits. Support moves to extend paternity leave. Introduce a maximum combined withdrawal rate for benefits and reforms to employment support allowance and cold weather payments. Protect policies such as concessionary travel for older Scots.Plaid Cymru: Move away from complex and expensive means testing for child-related benefits. Continue to campaign for the introduction of a living pension during the period of the next parliament for those aged 80 and over. UKIP: Only pay child benefit for the first two children for new claimants. Increase the Carers' Allowance to the same level as Jobseekers' Allowance (JSA) and pay a higher rate of JSA if you've been in work and already made tax and National Insurance contributions. Prevent anyone taking up permanent residence in Britain unless they're able to support themselves and any dependents they bring with them for at least five years and stop them receiving benefits. Stop paying child benefit for children who don't live in Britain. Scrap what UKIP calls the ""detested bedroom tax"". Boost ""credit unions"".Greens: The party backs a Citizen's Income, a fixed amount of £72 income a week to be paid to every individual, whether they are in work or not, to be funded by higher taxes on the better off and green levies.  But in the short-term it would increase the minimum wage to £10 by 2020. Ban zero hours contracts. Axe the ""bedroom tax"". Abolish the work capability assessment and restore the level of the former disability living allowance. Scrap the government's welfare cap, which limits the maximum amount a household can claim annually to £26,000 a year."

2015-04-20,Elephant trap?,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32047998,"The campaign has not even got under way, yet in the space of a couple of hours we have now been treated to not only one election pledge, but to two. The prime minister ruled out raising VAT if re-elected - while Labour said National Insurance contributions wouldn't go up.Usually politicians fudge the question of tax rises.  When he was leader of the opposition David Cameron himself said ""we have no need to raise taxes"" - before hiking up VAT after polling day.Famously, John Major said he had ""no plans"" to put up the sales tax -  before his chancellor did just that.And when he appeared in front of the cross-party Treasury committee of MPs on Tuesday, the current chancellor seemed to be continuing that tradition.  Under repeated questioning, George Osborne said: ""The policies we have do not involve a VAT rise.""That formulation appeared to give him not so much wriggle room, but an entire wriggle mansion.Labour assumed their campaign warning of further VAT rises to come under the Tories was very much on the money.But George Osborne's allies are suggesting privately that he had, in fact, been walking Ed Miliband to the edge of an elephant trap, then beckoning the prime minister to push the opposition leader in.Ed Miliband's strategists fully expected Mr Cameron to repeat the chancellor's obfuscation on tax at the final Prime Minister's Questions of this Parliament. They would then have expanded on the theme, inviting the prime minister to answer other difficult questions - then say he wasn't being straight with the British people for avoiding them.But the Labour leader was completely wrong-footed when first the prime minister said he would rule out a VAT rise and then counter-punched, inquiring if Labour would now rule out an increase in National Insurance contributions.Ed Miliband dodged the question and what could have been downbeat Conservative benches, uneasy over the prime minister's announcement this week of his retirement plans, were given something to cheer.The reason Ed Miliband didn't respond is because he was holding the National Insurance pledge back for Labour's manifesto.But that soon became unsustainable - so the other Ed, the shadow chancellor Ed Balls, had to undertake a hasty round of the TV studios to do just that.When I spoke to him mid-tour, he put on a brave face. His view was that George Osborne, having raised VAT from 17.5% to 20%, wanted to give the issue a low profile - whereas the prime minister had now made the mistake of putting it centre stage. And he believed David Cameron's promise would be judged against his past VAT-raising performance.He defended Ed Miliband's reluctance to talk about National Insurance as he felt it would have been ""inappropriate"" to announce Labour tax policy at PMQs.So the prime minister - always a better tactician than strategist - can at least satisfy himself that he smoked Labour out on NI and disrupted at least one entry in their election campaign grid.But the exchange actually raised more questions than it answered.If the main parties are ruling out further potential sources of revenue, but still committing themselves to eradicating a £90bn black hole in the public finances, will they now be under more pressure during the election campaign to spell out in much greater detail exactly what they intend to cut?"
2015-04-20,Who's next?,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32031343,"David Cameron's declaration that he will not seek a third term in office if he retains power in May has immediately stoked interest in who might fill his shoes when he's gone. Here are the likely - and perhaps less obvious - possibilities.Claim? As chancellor of the exchequer he's the man in charge of the purse strings and master strategist - and reportedly the PM's favourite to succeed him, although he hasn't said as much. Mr Cameron's right-hand man has had an image makeover of late, with a new haircut and a diet to shed some pounds. And he has seemingly recovered from his ""omnishambles"" Budget in 2012, with his latest - and last Budget - of the parliament giving the Tories a lead in some polls. He's said to be well liked among Conservative cabinet ministers and backbench MPs, whose support is vital for any candidate wanting to take on the party leadership. He shas some work to do among grassroots Tory members, however, coming fifth in ConservativeHome's latest online poll of party members on future leaders.Latest odds: 10/1 (according to William Hill)What's he said? ""The prime minister leads a strong team but what you see from him is answering a direct question with a direct answer. I think that's really refreshing. He says he's going to serve that full five years so the real question facing the country now is do you want the strong leadership of David Cameron that's delivering zero inflation and record jobs or do you want the chaos and incompetence of Ed Miliband.""Claim? The longest-serving home secretary in 50 years, she is only the second Conservative woman to secure one of the top four jobs in government. In her role, she has talked tough on immigration and crime and taken on the Police Federation. And she is popular with Tory activists, consistently occupying either first or second place in ConservativeHome's online polls on future party leaders. There have long been claims of Mrs May positioning herself for the top job, with reported tensions between her and the prime minister. Critics say she lacks charisma and micro-manages - while some cannot forget her coining the now infamous ""nasty party"" phrase at a Tory conference in 2002, but supporters say she is a formidable operator, and have dubbed her Britain's Angela Merkel. Latest odds: 9/2What's she said? ""My view is very simple, David Cameron is a first class leader of the party and a first class prime minister and I hope he is going to be doing that for a very long time."" (Desert Island discs, 23 November 2014)Claim? The blonde bombshell and mayor of London who can seemingly reach voters that others in the party cannot. Casting aside a rather chequered past he steered the capital through the 2012 Olympics, launched the successful and popular ""Boris bikes"" and got rid of London's ""bendy buses"" in favour of the new Routemaster double deckers. Mr Johnson hopes to revive his Westminster parliamentary career at the general election. He has been tipped by many to take the helm of the Conservative Party, and has not discouraged the idea. Like Theresa May, he is also a favourite among the grassroots of the party, pipping her to the top spot in ConservativeHome's latest poll of party members on future leaders. (he's ahead by 2 points). Critics say the gaffe-prone politician is not the right man for the job, but his supporters point to his wide-spread appeal.Latest odds: 9/4What's he said? ""I think what David Cameron is saying is banal and obvious. There has already been a leader of the Conservative Party for ten years and he's done an outstanding job. What he's saying now is that he wants to serve through to 2020 and that is frankly what we need him to do... five more years is what this country needs. I'm not entirely certain I see what the story is. He was asked a straight question, are you going to serve a third term like Mrs Thatcher or Tony Blair and he said no, because he thinks that ten years on top of British politics is an incredibly long time.""Claim? A self-made millionaire and devotee of Margaret Thatcher, he is regarded as one of the Conservatives' fastest-rising stars. The Treasury minister-turned-culture secretary became the first of the 2010 intake of MPs to reach cabinet level, and the first Asian male Conservative cabinet minister. He's currently polling well among the Conservative grassroots, who voted him third most preferable leader in ConservativeHome's latest online future leader poll. David Cameron recently said he wants to see a British Asian prime minister in his lifetime.Latest odds: 12/1Claim? Currently holding one of the four great offices of state - foreign secretary - Mr Hammond's name has often cropped up whenever talk of leadership contenders has emerged. He has built up an impressive CV in government since the Conservatives came to power in 2010, being first awarded the job of transport secretary before his promotion to defence secretary where he stayed for three years. He's regarded by many commentators as being a potential candidate for the Tory right. He seems to have work to do among party activists, scoring only 4% in ConservativeHome's future leader poll.Latest odds: 12/1"
2015-04-20,Cereal number,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-magazine-monitor-31962592,"David Cameron has declared he won't seek a third term as prime minister, citing an advertising slogan for Shredded Wheat used in the UK more than 30 years ago. What's its enduring power, asks Justin Parkinson.The hotel kitchen staff are in disbelief. Someone in room 147 has ordered three Shredded Wheat. The maid transports them upstairs to find England cricketer Ian Botham waiting at a table, dressed in full whites.The maid leaves. Botham hides one of the Shredded Wheat under a napkin and winks to camera. Cue music, as the slogan ""Shredded Wheat. Bet you can't eat three"" appears.This advert and others featuring football manager Brian Clough and the actor Richard Kiel, who played Jaws in James Bond films, have not run for some time. Nestle, which owns the brand, says the last probably aired in 1984.But their message seems to have waned little. Telling the BBC he would only serve a limited time in Downing Street, David Cameron said: ""Terms are like Shredded Wheat - two are wonderful but three might just be too many.""The prime minister's reprise was unlikely to be accidental, says Thayne Forbes, joint managing director of the brand-valuation company Intangible Business. ""Everybody would empathise with the view that three Shredded Wheat would probably be too much,"" he says. ""The slogan suggests people shouldn't overdo it. It sounds modest and reasoned.""As marketing goes, it might seem counter-intuitive, as it discourages excessive consumption. But it also sounds honest and unexploitative.Other advertising slogans and themes are in wide use in public and political discourse. Examples include Marmite being a by-word for divisiveness - a ""Marmite person"" is either loved or hated. Cameron has twice referred to Ronseal - the woodcare product that does ""exactly what it says on the tin"". But Shredded Wheat, its best-known slogan having lain dormant for so long, appears to be used less often. The cereal, created in the US in the 1890s, has long been sold as good for the evolving British lifestyle. A newspaper advert in 1902 described it as ""a relief from the monotony of everlasting porridge"", while, by 1943, it was ""an ideal food for all war workers"". The 1980s saw an emphasis on ""simple, honest goodness"", while, in the 2000s, its long heritage and reliability was promoted.""It's a good association for Cameron,"" says Forbes. ""He must have been brought up on it, like lots of other people. It will be great marketing for Shredded Wheat to have the slogan used after so many years, too.""Subscribe to the BBC News Magazine's email newsletter to get articles sent to your inbox"
2015-04-20,Are you 'cosmopolitan'?,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32021853,"The rise of UKIP heralds the emergence of a new divide in British politics, with cosmopolitan voters on one side and non-cosmopolitan ones on the other, argues Jeremy Cliffe.We hear a lot about UKIP these days. The party stole the show at the local and European elections last year, then again in the autumn when it lured two Conservative MPs to defect.  In the past weeks alone there have been three much-discussed television programmes about the party: ""Meet the Ukippers"", ""Farage Fans and UKIP Lovers"" and ""100 Days of UKIP"". At the upcoming general election the party will probably increase its share of seats in Westminster - and will certainly affect the results in dozens of other constituencies by taking votes from the other parties. But ask some of those academics who have been watching UKIP's rise, and they will tell you that it is just one part of a bigger story. We are all used to the left-right divide in politics: a spectrum of different views on how much the government should tax, spend, regulate and otherwise intervene in the economy. But according to Dr Rob Ford of Manchester University, UKIP exists on a different axis, one to do with cultural rather than economic matters. This new political scale is ever more prominent in British political life.Radio 4's Analysis programmeOn the one end of it is what you might call a ""cosmopolitan"" philosophy: a relaxed, liberal attitude to issues concerning national identity (like immigration) and to questions of morality and lifestyle (like gay marriage). On the other end is a ""non-cosmopolitan"" outlook: more nationalist, socially conservative and less comfortable with social change, or in other words the ideological stance often associated with typical UKIP voters. This divide cuts across the left-right scale: there are cosmopolitan and non-cosmopolitan voters in both the Conservative and the Labour camps, which is why UKIP takes support from both.Lots of things are making this cosmopolitanism divide more important. One is that the old class-based, ideological conflict between left and right has declined. Dr James Tilley of Oxford University argues that politicians are partly to blame. The economic philosophies of the Conservative and Labour parties are so similar, he argues, that other, cultural issues are becoming more important. Another factor is the growing gap between the generations: the difference in outlook between the cosmopolitan young and less cosmopolitan, older voters is greater than it was in the past (partly due to the recent rise in levels of university education, which tend to correlate with liberal views). This trend presents the established parties with some difficult questions. As Dr Ford puts it, they ""have to try and deal with this rising value divide, particularly now that UKIP has mobilised it into the political debate."" ""They have to make a move,"" he adds, ""but any move that they make risks making their position worse with one or the other of these groups of voters."" Sound too cosmopolitan, and the parties risk losing supporters to UKIP. Try to ""out-UKIP UKIP"", and they could alienate their younger, more socially liberal supporters. So both are doing the political splits, trying to reconcile the cosmopolitans within their ranks with the non-cosmopolitans. Witness the tortuous attempts by Ed Miliband to sound tough on immigration without sounding too tough. Witness, too, the recent struggles of David Cameron to persuade social conservatives in his party that gay marriage can be an innately conservative institution. In the long-term, this divide will become less problematic. That is because over the years the country will tilt towards the cosmopolitan end of this new spectrum. So says Penny Young of NatCen, the research organisation that conducts the extensive British Social Attitudes survey. Various demographic factors explain this trend. The country as a whole is becoming more accepting of same-sex relationships. Younger voters are more relaxed about things like immigration and national identity than were previous generations when they were young, suggesting that the overall population will tilt in an internationalist direction over time. And ever more parts of the country are acquiring the ethnic and social diversity once confined to the inner cities, a trend that generally makes people more comfortable with immigration. According to Dr Ford the question is therefore: how should the main political parties navigate this period of transition? It would be wrong to simply abandon the swathes of voters at the less cosmopolitan end of the scale; voters who are usually older and more isolated than the average member of the population.Yet the politicians do need to adapt to the changing attitudes of British society and be honest with voters rather than pandering to views that, deep down, they do not share. This quandary may not decide the upcoming general election, but in the established parties savvy strategists with an eye to elections in 2020 and beyond are grappling with it nonetheless. That is a wise move."
2015-04-20,Dudley debate,https://web.archive.org//web/20150326065731/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32015334,"I met Afzal Amin for the first time on Friday, but I already knew who he was. In Dudley North, the seat he was selected by the Conservatives to fight in the general election, Mr Amin had become hard to avoid. When I first looked at the local newspaper online, the pages were surrounded by ""Amin"" logos in the preferred Tory shade of blue.Not long after we met, he asked me to pose for a photo, snapped by one of his campaign team, and doubtless rapidly tweeted out to followers of the would-be MP.Perhaps no surprise that the man running such a disciplined operation has served in the army and been to Sandhurst. That was very much the message he delivered on Friday, as he addressed school and college pupils at a hustings in Dudley which I'd been invited to chair.There was combative debate, too, not least with his Labour rival, the MP Ian Austin. Both men knew the Dudley contest was critical for their respective parties; Ian Austin held the seat by just over 600 votes in 2010. Just as David Cameron was denied a majority by failing to take seats like this one, so Ed Miliband is unlikely to be in No 10 if Labour loses Dudley North.He was self-confident and fluent. The only obvious mis-step came right at the end, when he interrupted Vicky Duckworth, the Green candidate for the neighbouring seat. She expressed the opinion that politics often seemed to be about men shouting at each other; Mr Amin complained she was engaging in gender bias.A few weeks ago, one Conservative MP who knows him well and respects his talents, said Afzal Amin had warned him of the risks of over-confidence. He thought he risked running before he could walk.Well, he stumbled badly this weekend. Whatever the purpose of his contacts with the English Defence League - and he strongly disputes claims that he wanted them to hold a protest that would then be called off, for which he could then take the credit - the exposure has damaged him and, potentially, the prospects of his party re-taking the seat.In February, the EDL staged a rally against plans for a new mosque in the town. As the Mail on Sunday story makes clear, Afzal Amin pleaded with them beforehand not to hold that demonstration; but it went ahead anyway. It's what happened subsequently which will feature in Tuesday's disciplinary hearing.Over the weekend, I put his defence to a very senior Conservative source - that this was an attempt to broker a compromise in order to bring together a divided community. The arch response: Dudley isn't Kandahar.Nor do I think from my visits to the town, where I'm going to be based for the general election, will people in Dudley appreciate being painted as somewhere riven by racial discord.True, Dudley was the scene of one of England's earliest race riots. But that was in 1962. Although the controversy over replacing the mosque - currently in a converted school and inadequate for the numbers who want to worship there - has been running for a decade, community relations are generally good. Even those who don't want a new mosque didn't want the EDL protestors - nor to be fair the anti-fascist counter-demonstrators who followed them.As for the Conservative Party, the view of the national leadership is that you don't collaborate with the EDL. Not least because the Tories are still struggling to bury some historic baggage in the Black Country: Enoch Powell was an MP in Wolverhampton when he delivered his Rivers of Blood speech about immigration in 1968.Four years before that, there was the notorious election in Smethwick which the Conservatives were accused of winning by wooing white voters with an offensive rhyme suggesting who'd they'd get as a neighbour if they voted Labour. Afzal Amin grew up in Smethwick so he should be aware of that history. He was, until his suspension on Saturday, one of about 17% of Conservative parliamentary candidates who are not white. The party is proud of that, but it's still struggling to translate that into votes.Afzal Amin may believe that he can persuade the party to lift the suspension when he meets party officials on Tuesday. I have my doubts. Even if they accept his defence, will the other parties be so charitable? The allegations would follow him on the campaign trail, and make planned visits by cabinet ministers next to impossible.On Friday, just before the hustings in Dudley began, Afzal Amin gave me his business card. It introduces him as 'prospective member of Parliament Dudley North'. I think I'll keep it; it could yet become a collector's item."

2015-04-21,Scots Labour leader Murphy to resign,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32760196,"Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy is to resign next month, he has announced.It comes despite Mr Murphy narrowly surviving a vote of no confidence at a meeting of the party's national executive in Glasgow. Mr Murphy said he would tender his resignation alongside a plan to reform the party.He lost his seat in last week's general election as the SNP won 56 of the 59 Scottish seats, leaving Labour with a single MP in Scotland.Mr Murphy said he wanted to have a successor as leader in place by the summer, and confirmed he would not be standing for a seat at the Scottish Parliament in next year's election. Instead, he said it was time to ""do something else"" and that he believed the party would continue to be divided if he remained as leader. His deputy, Kezia Dugdale MSP, will become acting leader until a permanent successor is found. Mr Murphy had faced calls to resign from several MSPs, trade unions and former MPs in the wake of his party's near wipeout at the general election.He insisted he had decided to stand down ahead of the national executive voting by 17-14 in favour of him staying in the job.Speaking at a media conference after the national executive meeting, he said: ""It is clear that a small minority who didn't accept my election as leader of the Scottish Labour Party just five months ago won't accept the vote of the executive today and that will continue to divide the party.""Today I received more support in the executive vote than I did from members of the executive when I stood for election five months ago.""He said it would be up to the executive whether to accept the reforms he would be proposing before he left the post. But he warned: ""A party in such urgent need of reform blocks those changes at its peril.""The former East Renfrewshire MP said Labour had been crushed between ""two nationalisms"" in Scotland and England.Mr Murphy said he left no legacy of bitterness for anyone in the Labour Party, and the only person he was angry at was the person who blamed Scottish Labour for the party's UK-wide general election defeat - a reference to Unite leader Len McCluskey.And he said that in many ways Scottish Labour was the ""least modernised part of the Labour movement"" and that he wanted his successor to be elected under a one member, one vote system.Mr Murphy added: ""The Labour Party's problem is not the link with trade unions, or even the relationship with Unite members - far from it. It is the destructive behaviour of one high profile trade unionist.""The leader of the Scottish Labour Party doesn't serve at the grace of Len McCluskey, and the next leader of the UK Labour Party should not be picked by Len McCluskey.""Mr McCluskey has been a vocal critic of Mr Murphy's leadership and opposed his appointment in December when Mr Murphy won the contest to replace Johann Lamont.Jim Murphy laughed and joked with Scottish Labour's sole MP as he made his way down the hotel corridor to announce his resignation.He certainly brought energy and dynamism to his election campaign - but all that achieved was Ian Murray in Edinburgh South.So as Mr Murphy bows out, who could replace him?The deputy leader Kezia Dugdale may want to step up or Neil Findlay could try again after challenging last time. Maybe the party's finance spokeswoman Jackie Baillie thinks her steady hand could steer the ship.Jenny Marra is also often talked about as future face of the party.Whoever steps into Jim Murphy's red shoes he or she will have to face a difficult 2016 Holyrood election, to put it mildly.There are also more fundamental questions about how the party can possibly move on as it faces a surging SNP.Mr Murphy was very much a creature of ""New Labour"" - but to today's generation that's old Labour.Party members may start looking for someone with no links to the past, neither a Brownite nor a Blairite. A 'cleanskin' - as the politicos put it - may well help re-connect with voters.That's a long way from now though - even some of the party's opponents may view this latest train wreck with a modicum of sympathy. Ms Lamont had resigned after claiming Scottish Labour was treated like a ""branch office"" by the London-based party leadership.Mr Murphy concluded his speech by saying: ""Scotland needs a strong Labour party; Scotland needs a united Labour party. We have been the greatest force for change in our nation's remarkable history. ""The Scottish Labour party will rise again. It will be under someone else's leadership and I am confident about my party's future.""Harriet Harman MP, acting leader of the UK Labour Party, said it would be for Scottish Labour to choose a new leader. She added: ""As a cabinet minister and leader of his party in Scotland, Jim has been a hugely important figure in the Labour Party. He leaves with the best wishes and thanks of our movement.""Labour peer Lord McConnell, a former Scottish first minister, said the party's problems were ""much deeper than one individual and one affiliate"".He said: ""We have a disconnect locally and nationally with wider Scottish society. ""We have a problem with our political positioning in the post devolution age where the party particularly at the UK level has never been comfortable with success in the Scottish parliament and has always tried to see things through a UK prism rather than a Scottish prism.""We need to find a new generation, a new leader, new generation, new ideas, a fresh approach.""In a tweet, Scottish first minister and SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said: ""I wish Jim Murphy all the very best for the future. Leadership is not easy and he deserves credit for standing up for what he believes in.""Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson also reacted on Twitter, saying: ""Jim Murphy announces a managed exit in order to help the party, which is to his credit. But leaves a tough gig for whoever comes next.""The meeting of Scottish Labour's executive was disrupted by protesters who entered the party's headquarters.Police were called and the protesters, who included persistent anti-austerity activists Sean Clerkin and Piers Doughty-Brown, left the building to protest further from the street outside.The protesters were calling for Mr Murphy to remain as leader to ""finish the job of destroying Scottish Labour"".A Police Scotland spokeswoman said officers had been called and found two protestors on the third floor of the building. She added: ""Both left on police arrival. Advice and assistance was given."""
2015-04-21,Labour contenders clash on spending,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32761561,"Prospective Labour leaders have clashed over Labour's record in government in their first public debate in the race to succeed Ed Miliband.Former cabinet ministers including Yvette Cooper and Andy Burnham defended Labour's fiscal record and spending on schools and hospitals.However, candidates from the 2010 intake of MPs argued that the party spent too much while in office.The debate followed Chuka Umunna's withdrawal from the leadership contest.The remaining candidates appeared at the annual conference of the Progress think tank in London.There was agreement that Labour needed to demonstrate economic credibility to regain power, with shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt telling the meeting that the party needed to be ""trusted with public finances and the family finances"".Mr Hunt, who was first elected to Parliament in 2010 when Labour lost power, argued the last Labour government ""spent too much"" and failed to ""leave enough economic headroom to deal with the economic crisis and the recession"".Shadow health minister Liz Kendall said: ""There's absolutely nothing progressive about spending more on debt interest payments than on educating our children.""But shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: ""The Tories have had a triumph of spin over the facts in saying what they said about the economic record of the last Labour government.""The former chief secretary to the Treasury said the deficit did ""grow too large"" in the government's later years but insisted: ""The last Labour government ran more surpluses in its first term than the Tories did in 18 years.""Yvette Cooper, another former chief secretary to the Treasury, said: ""We should never let anybody tell us that it was too many teachers, doctors or nurses that caused Lehman Brothers bank in New York to crash.""Shadow international development secretary Mary Creagh said: ""People have forgotten the economic credibility that the last Labour government had.""She said Labour had built schools and hospitals that were ""treasured in our communities"".Ms Cooper, Mr Burnham, Ms Kendall and Ms Creagh have declared their intention to run for leader, while Mr Hunt told the conference he would make an announcement next week.At the same event, shadow energy secretary Caroline Flint announced she would be running for deputy leader.The Don Valley MP told the Today programme ahead of the debate that Labour lost the election because ""fundamentally the public did not trust us on the economy"".Exeter MP Ben Bradshaw has already announced a bid to be deputy, saying Labour ""must and could win the next election"", but only if it ""broadens its appeal by adopting sensible, centre-left politics which celebrate wealth creation and entrepreneurship"".Former Labour campaign co-ordinator Tom Watson is reported to be crowd-funding a deputy leadership bid, while Walthamstow MP Stella Creasy has said she is ""open to the question"" of running.Barnsley East MP and shadow transport secretary Michael Dugher - a fierce critic of Ed Miliband's election campaign - is to run Mr Burnham's campaign, according to the website LabourList.It is reported that Mr Burnham also has the backing of Labour peer Lord Falconer, who was lord chancellor and justice secretary under Tony Blair and was close to the former PM.Shadow culture secretary Chris Bryant has signalled his backing for Ms Cooper, tweeting that the next leader must be ""someone who's been tried in the fiery furnace of public opinion"".Mr Hunt said on Friday he would be be attending the debate - along with the other four hopefuls - to ""set out my analysis on how we begin to understand what went so wrong and why"".He added: ""We must use this leadership election to ask some very profound questions.""All voices in the party must be heard so that we can have a full and proper assessment as to why the politics of nationalism triumphed in Scotland and huge swathes of England, and how we have allowed the Conservative Party to present a more compelling vision for Britain to so many millions of people.""Speculation still surrounds shadow business secretary Mr Umunna's decision to pull out on Friday, when he said he was not ""comfortable"" with the ""pressure"" of being a candidate.As well as citing extensive pressure and scrutiny Mr Umunna also said he was ruling himself out because of concerns about the impact of the bid on his family.A rising star of the party, Mr Umunna was first elected to Parliament in 2010 - alongside Tristram Hunt and Liz Kendall - before joining the shadow cabinet.Asked about the candidate who might win, Conservative Chancellor George Osborne said: ""The Labour leadership contest has descended into farce.""But it's not actually about personalities. I don't think the Labour Party any more represents the working people of this country who aspire to a better life."""

I'm not suggesting he takes a break from being leader.""Clearly the national executive has the authority, they're the ruling body. ""I'm told that they made a decision. I'm told it was a procedurally correct decision, he is the leader but I think it's important that as leader he takes a break and I think it's important that we work out how these complex questions are answered by a team.""No one person has all the answers. I'm particularly concerned about tone, making sure we get a tone that ensures that the 27 million people who didn't vote for UKIP last week may be persuaded to vote for us in future.""The party has been beset by wrangling since Mr Farage agreed to stay on as leader, days after standing down after failing to get elected in Thanet South.He had pledged before the general election that he would quit the post if he failed to get elected to Parliament.Senior aide Matthew Richardson has left the party, following claims from MEP Patrick O'Flynn that Mr Farage had fallen under the influence of ""inexperienced"" advisers.UKIP has also confirmed the departure of Mr Farage's chief of staff Raheem Kassam.Mr Farage ruled out quitting as leader on BBC's Question Time on Thursday, saying he had ""phenomenal"" support, and has challenged his critics to decide whether they want to stay in the party.In his article, Mr Carswell had said that ""knowing how difficult it is to lead a party makes me admire Nigel Farage all the more"".""I know that I never could,"" he added, stressing that he would find it ""impossible to simultaneously lead UKIP, be the voice of the party in the Commons, represent my Clacton constituents and at the same time be a husband and a dad"".However, he said that ""even leaders need to take a break"", adding: ""Nigel needs to take a break now.""UKIP got nearly four million votes at the election, but returned only one MP - former Conservative Mr Carswell in the Clacton constituency."
2015-04-21,Coasting schools 'must improve',https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/education-32763097,"Education Secretary Nicky Morgan has said new powers to sack head teachers in coasting schools will show ""it is not OK to be just above the level of failing"". Under the plans, ministers could force schools rated as ""requiring improvement"" and missing new government benchmarks to become an academy.Coasting schools have average results which have often flatlined over time.Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, Mrs Morgan said faster action was needed.She said: ""Our big priorities will be to speed up the process for tackling failing schools; extend our academies programme to tackle 'coasting' schools; and deliver on our commitment to open new free schools.""The proposals will be in a new bill due to be introduced in the Queen's Speech. ""First, we will take new powers to step in from the moment that a school is found to be failing,"" Mrs Morgan said.""From day one, regional schools commissioners will be able to bring in new leadership and support from other excellent schools and heads, and we will speed up the process of turning schools into academies to make sure that new expert leadership is found for all schools that need it as quickly as possible.""She said that coasting schools will be put on an immediate notice to improve and could then be taken over and turned into an academy.They will be required to work with a team of ""expert"" head teachers.She said: ""Those that aren't able to demonstrate a clear plan for improvement will be given new leadership - we know this works in turning schools around.""More than 3,300 schools in England are labelled ""requires improvement"", but the plans are unlikely to cover that many schools.Under the current system, secondary schools are considered to be failing, and therefore eligible for intervention, if fewer than 40% of their students score at least five Cs at GCSE, including English and maths, and they do not meet national averages in pupil progress.In primary schools, the threshold for intervention is if fewer than 65% of pupils get Level 4 in reading, writing and maths and a below average number of pupils make the expected amount of progress.It is not yet clear how coasting schools will be deemed in need of intervention.It is understood that a new category will be devised covering schools which are rated as ""requires improvement"" and which fail to meet a new set of standards on improvement."
2015-04-21,Co-op Group to keep political funding,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-32762858,"The Co-operative Group has decided to continue financially supporting the Co-operative Party, which has strong ties to Labour.Members of the group, the UK's biggest mutual organisation, voted on the issue at their annual general meeting.They passed a motion by 48,579 for, to 39,479 against, to approve ""political expenditures"" of up to £1m which support the movement's objectives.Last year the Co-op Group gave £625,000 to the Co-op Party.This figure was down on the sums donated in previous years. The AGM also included a vote on new corporate governance procedures which would mean members having less of a direct say.The Co-operative Group is still recovering from a period of financial mismanagement and some members have recently expressed concerns about how elections to the board are chosen.The banking arm of the group came close to collapse in 2013, bringing the whole group to a £2.5bn annual loss that year. The Co-op Party includes among its members a number of Labour MPs, including shadow chancellor Chris Leslie and Walthamstow MP Stella Creasy. The politicians stand as candidates of both the Co-operative Party and the Labour Party, and the two political movements have strong historical ties. The board asked the members of the Co-operative Group whether they wanted to continue financially supporting the Co-operative Party, or any other party. Allan Leighton, chairman of the Co-op Group, said: ""There's a clear remit from the members to continue to support the Labour Party.""It allows us to now have a conversation with the Co-op Labour Party about what we do next.""There was also a members' motion on the agenda, put forward by those in favour of making political donations of up to £1m a year.The motion to approve political funding ""not to exceed £1m per annum"" was carried by 55.17% to 44.83%.BBC business correspondent Joe Lynam said: ""To meet a £1.5bn hole in its accounts - mostly stemming from its banking division - the Co-op Group has had to sell off parts of its businesses and hand over majority control of its bank to American hedge funds.""It's also in the process of radically changing the way it runs itself into a more corporate structure with less of a direct say by its members.""He said that ""in theory"", each of the 2.8 million Co-op members could vote on a series of motions about the reforms, as well as how its bosses are paid, and retaining the links to the Co-operative party.One of the group's largest independent societies, Midcounties, recently threatened legal action over a shortlist of six candidates for the group's board being reduced to three - the number of positions available - before a member vote.

2015-04-21,Osborne plans July 'stability' Budget,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32761566,"Chancellor George Osborne has said that he will deliver a new Budget on 8 July.He claimed it would have ""a laser-like focus"" on raising productivity and living standards.He said he was making the unusual move of having a second Budget in one year in order to ""deliver on the commitments we have made to working people"".Labour said the chancellor would have to set out ""who is going to pay"" for what it called ""uncosted promises"" in the election campaign.Speaking outside 11 Downing Street, the chancellor gave a broad outline of his plans for the forthcoming Budget but refused to be drawn on the details, including the Conservatives' planned £12bn of welfare cuts.""I don't want to wait to deliver on the commitments we have made to working people,"" he said.""It will continue with the balanced plan we have to deal with our debts, invest in our health service and reform welfare to make work pay.""But there will also be a laser-like focus on making our economy more productive so we raise living standards across our country.""We're going to put Britain into good shape for the long term.""The last Budget was held on 18 March and included tax cuts for first-time house buyers.Writing in the Sun, Mr Osborne admitted it was ""unusual"" to have two Budgets in the same year, but he wanted to turn ""promises made in the election into a reality"".Again, Mr Osborne did not specifically outline how the Conservatives plan to fulfil a pledge to cut £12bn in welfare spending but said he wants to make the welfare system ""fair for the people who pay for it"".He writes: ""We will protect the NHS and give it more funding each and every year, while making savings across Whitehall. ""We'll crack down hard on tax avoidance and aggressive tax planning by the rich - because everyone should pay their fair share.  ""We will always protect the most vulnerable, but we also need a welfare system that's fair to the people who pay for it. If you can work you should be working, so we'll take the next steps in our benefit reforms to make sure that happens.""Second, we've got to go on helping businesses create jobs in Britain, so we move towards full employment. That means facing a hard truth: in Britain we produce about a quarter less for every hour we work than countries like America or Germany. Fixing that long-running productivity weakness is the big challenge for the next five years.""So in the Budget we'll spend less on welfare, and instead invest to create three million more apprenticeships, so that young people can learn a trade, get better jobs and earn more.""After the Budget in March independent forecaster the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said that Mr Osborne needed to spell out exactly how he plans to cut £12bn from welfare spending.Of those £12bn planned cuts, £2bn were outlined ahead of the general election - all the cuts are supposed to be in place by 2017-18.Labour's shadow energy and climate change secretary, Caroline Flint, accused the Tories of making ""a number of uncosted promises"" during the election campaign.She told the BBC: ""It will be interesting to see who is going to pay for those uncosted policies when they bring the Budget in July."""

If it isn't, stop it and do something else.""He also criticised Mr Farage's comments about HIV patients during the TV leaders' debate last month.While debating about the NHS, Mr Farage said: ""You can come into Britain from anywhere in the world and get diagnosed with HIV and get the retro-viral drugs that cost up to £25,000 per year per patient.""Mr Carswell wrote: ""By all means we should highlight the problem of health tourism. But we need to admit that using the example of HIV patients to make the point was ill-advised.""He said the party needed to strike ""the right tone"" and added: ""UKIP has been at its most persuasive when we have been most optimistic.""Anger is never a great way to motivate people - at least not for very long.""The party has been beset by wrangling since Mr Farage agreed to stay on as leader, days after standing down after failing to get elected in Thanet South.He had pledged before the general election that he would quit the post if he failed to get elected to Parliament.Matthew Richardson has left the party, following claims from MEP Patrick O'Flynn that Mr Farage had fallen under the influence of ""inexperienced"" advisers.

They absolutely loved how he helped them and he was a highly-regarded local MP,"" Mr Bone said.""He stood up for what was right rather than what the party line was. In those days - the John Major years - it was much more difficult to stand up against the party machine. He had strong views on Europe.""Sir Peter started his career as an insurance broker, joining the Wycombe Young Conservatives in 1949 and the Oxford University Conservative Association in 1951.He went on to become a Conservative councillor on Buckinghamshire County Council between 1961 and 1967.Wellingborough mayor-elect Barry Graves also paid tribute to Sir Peter, remembering him as a ""very strong constituency MP"".""I remember going out and canvassing with him and he would go everywhere.

2015-04-21,PM will 'look at' powers proposals,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32746049,"David Cameron has said he would ""look at"" any proposals for further powers for Scotland but wants to get the Smith Commission plans implemented first.The prime minister was speaking after meeting Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon in Edinburgh.Mr Cameron said he made a ""commitment"" to include a devolution bill in the Queen's Speech later this month.Ms Sturgeon argued the Smith Commission proposals were ""a good starting point"" but did not go far enough.The prime minister has pledged to include a bill on devolution in this month's Queen's Speech which would be based on the cross-party Smith Commission agreement. The Smith proposals included giving Holyrood the power to set income tax rates and bands, as well as control over a share of VAT and some welfare benefits. But Ms Sturgeon's SNP also wants the Scottish Parliament to be given powers over business taxes, employment law, the minimum wage and additional powers over welfare.Speaking after meeting Ms Sturgeon, Mr Cameron told the BBC: ""Let's make sure Smith is implemented in full. I'm going to keep the commitment I made to the people of Scotland. Let's get that done first because it does create a really strong Scottish Parliament.""He added: ""Of course, if people want to make future proposals I'll look at them.""The prime minister again said he did not support full fiscal autonomy for Scotland - the responsibility for all areas of tax and spending except defence and foreign affairs - stating that it would mean £7bn of cuts or extra tax-raising.What Nicola Sturgeon is trying to say is she has a mandate. She has 56 out of the 59 MPs elected in Scotland and she won 50% of the vote - unprecedented here in Scotland.She says that gives her leverage to push David Cameron. David Cameron says he wants to keep the nation together.The language coming out of Westminster last week was very much a cordial one. 'We will listen'.Nicola Sturgeon has warned him that if he doesn't listen, then the people of Scotland will judge him accordingly.Ms  Sturgeon described the hour-long talks at her official residence at Bute House as ""constructive and business-like"". She said Mr Cameron had made a ""commitment"" that the Smith proposals would be implemented ""as agreed"".""But secondly the prime minister agreed that he would look at proposals that we would now send to suggest the areas we can go beyond Smith,"" Ms Sturgeon said.""There was no agreement in terms of the substance of that but we will submit those proposals, the prime minister has said they will consider them and there will be a meeting to look at how we take that further forward.""Referring to her party's success in last week's general election, which saw the SNP win 56 out of 59 Scottish seats, Ms Sturgeon said: ""People in Scotland have now voted fairly convincingly for the SNP and sent a message that we want the Smith Commission proposals to go further and be built on.""The ball is in his court but I'm going into this in good faith.""She added: ""David Cameron and I are a world apart politically but, where we can, I'm determined to do business in the interests of the people of Scotland and across the UK.""She said she would have a ""constructive and business-like"" relationship with the prime minister. The two leaders shook hands on the front steps of Bute House as Mr Cameron arrived. Mr Cameron left the building shortly before 11:00, almost an hour after he had arrived.The two sides agreed to hold more regular discussions in the future, possibly quarterly. "
2015-04-21,Umunna withdraws Labour leader bid,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32748106,"Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna has withdrawn from the Labour party leadership contest, just days after throwing his hat into the ring.The MP, 36, said in a statement that he was not comfortable with the level of pressure and scrutiny that came with being a leadership candidate.Mr Umunna also cited concerns about the impact of the bid on his family.BBC political editor Nick Robinson said the MP's team insisted no ""unwelcome press story"" lay behind the move.But Mr Umunna had been shocked by the level of scrutiny of himself, his mother, sister and girlfriend, he said.You can follow the latest reaction here.A rising star of the party, Mr Umunna was first elected to Parliament in 2010 before joining the shadow cabinet.He confirmed his candidacy for the Labour leadership via a post on his Facebook page on 12 May, saying the party under Ed Miliband had failed to appeal to enough voters in England.But on Friday he said he had not found the leadership bid to be ""a comfortable experience"".I understand that Chuka Umunna has told friends that ""this is not right for me or people close to me. I'm human, the rest of my life is more important to me than politics.""The shadow business secretary has been distressed by the degree of scrutiny he, his family and his girlfriend have come under since he declared his intention to stand for the labour leadership.I am told that this includes reporters waiting outside the houses of relatives late at night.Friends of Mr Umunna deny that he is nervous of not getting the support of enough MPs to run for the leadership; they point out that he already has half the necessary names and that there are some weeks to go.The shadow business secretary now wants to play a leading role in arguing that Britain should stay in the EU and does not rule out seeking the leadership in the future.He said he thought he had understood ""the scrutiny and attention a leadership contest would bring"", but added: ""However, since the night of our defeat last week I have been subject to the added level of pressure that comes with being a leadership candidate.""The shadow business secretary said he had wondered if it was too soon for him to stand for the leadership, and ""I fear it was."" He also cited concerns about the impact on ""the rest of one's life"" and those close to him.""Consequently, after further reflection, I am withdrawing my candidacy,"" he said.Mr Umunna said he would continue to serve as shadow business secretary and hoped to ""play a leading role"" in Labour's campaign to keep the UK in the EU during the forthcoming in/out referendum.Commenting on the news, Labour former culture secretary Ben Bradshaw - who is expected to run for deputy leader - said Mr Umunna was a ""terrible loss"" to the field.He told the BBC's Daily Politics the Streatham MP had been the candidate the Conservative Party ""feared the most"".""And if it's the result of pressure on an extended family or an extended group of friends, I think that's a very sad reflection on our political culture,"" he said.Chuka Umunna feels ""liberated"", he told me, by his decision to quit the Labour leadership race.He hopes to be given a good role (shadow chancellor, I wonder?) by whoever becomes Labour leader. And I expect he'll become very high profile in the campaign to keep Britain in Europe, which is increasingly looking like it will be next May.He'll endorse a candidate in the next four weeks before nominations close. It will be very interesting to see who he piles in behind.Read more from Allegra (see post 13.23).Former Labour leader Lord Kinnock said he thought Mr Umunna had made the right decision.He said: ""If he felt in his soul that he wasn't prepared to subject himself - and more importantly his family - to the kind of attention which is fairly typical, sadly, these days, he has done absolutely the right thing.""There is no point at all in inflicting avoidable, unnecessary misery on those you love most.""Leadership contender Mary Creagh said she had ""huge respect"" for Mr Umunna, telling BBC Radio 4's World at One programme it took ""courage"" to withdraw from the leadership race.Mr Umunna was ""a big beast"" and would play a ""big role"" in the future of the Labour Party, she added.Yvette Cooper, Andy Burnham, Liz Kendall and Mary Creagh have already thrown their hats into the ring for Labour's top job while a number of other potential candidates, including Dan Jarvis, Alan Johnson and David Lammy, have ruled themselves out. Candidates must secure nominations from 34 colleagues - 15% of the party's MPs - by 15 June to make it on to ballot papers, which will be sent to members in August ahead of the leader's election a month later."
2015-04-21,Former MEP guilty of expenses fraud,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-32752918,"A former MEP has been convicted of fraudulently claiming almost £500,000 in European Parliament expenses.Ashley Mote, 79, denied 11 charges relating to fraudulent claims to pay people he said were ""whistleblowers"".The offences included obtaining a money transfer by deception, fraud, acquiring criminal property and false accounting.Mote, from Binsted, Hampshire, sat as an independent MEP for South East England from 2004-2009 after being expelled from UKIP for benefit fraud.He was found guilty of four counts of obtaining a money transfer by deception, three of false accounting, two of fraud, and one each of acquiring criminal property, concealing criminal property and theft.The offences took place between November 2004 and July 2010.Mote was released on conditional bail. However, Mr Justice Stuart Smith at Southwark Crown Court said there was a ""very strong likelihood"" a custodial sentence would follow.The jury heard how Mote submitted numerous false expenses claims for payment for work that organisations had allegedly carried out on his behalf.Mote claimed the money was to pay whistleblowers in cash through third parties. He also said he had been ""targeted for being an anti-EU MEP.""During his time an MEP he also made £250,000 legitimate expenses claims.No date has been set for the sentencing."

2015-04-21,Round-up: BBC experts' analysis,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/election-2015-32650417,"The political future of the United Kingdom has become clearer after the results of the general election emerged around the country.David Cameron says he hopes to govern for all of the UK after the Conservatives took 331 seats - enough to form a slender majority in the Commons.Labour has been all but wiped out by the SNP in Scotland and suffered a disappointing set of results elsewhere, while the Lib Dems are left with just eight MPs after many party heavyweights such as Vince Cable and Danny Alexander lost their seats.So with battles won and lost and the fall-out and celebrations beginning, BBC correspondents examine the implications and challenges that lie ahead for the new government - and for those whose political careers have been ended by voters.No pollster, no pundit, no political leader saw it coming - not even David Cameron himself.Governing parties don't gain seats. Parties that have implemented painful cuts and are promising more certainly don't. Until that is the Conservative Party did - achieving what had seemed to be Mission Impossible - a Tory majority.Until that is David Cameron's personal triumph which triggered the near simultaneous resignation of his three principle opponents - Messrs Miliband, Clegg and Farage.They did so in part because they helped to crush their partners in coalition these last five years - reducing the Liberal Democrat parliamentary party to a size when it can fit into two London taxis and still have two seats to spare.In part because the extraordinary tidal wave of support for the SNP swept dozens of once safe Labour seats away.In part because Nigel Farage persuaded millions to vote for him but secured just one seat - not, though, the one he was standing in.Read more from Nick Robinson hereThe question uppermost in the prime minister's mind as he assembles his new government is how to keep the kingdom united.""Above all I want to bring our country together,"" he revealed after the result, ""to reclaim a mantle we should never have lost - the mantle of one nation, one United Kingdom"".Looking at the political landscape from Land's End today is very different to the view from John O'Groats.A sea of Conservative and Unionist blue dominates the scene across much of England, while a field of SNP nationalist yellow stretches to the horizon and beyond from the north.David Cameron's greatest challenge is to prevent the union he supports being torn apart by mutual resentment - resentment from Scotland at a Westminster government dominated by English Tories, and resentment from England at the preferential treatment people think is being given to the Scots.Those who assumed the future of the Union had been safeguarded by the Scottish referendum must think again.Read more from Mark Easton hereOne thing is rock-solid true: the Conservatives who worked on this campaign are as surprised by the result as the pollsters, pundits, politicians and general population.Maybe they shouldn't be - the economy is in good shape and the Conservatives had incumbency advantage.But when I travelled back from the prime minister's last rally with a group of exhausted Conservative campaign officials it was clear that 290 seats was a hoped-for target.No-one talked about anything over 300 seats, and no-one even mentioned an overall majority.So what special sauce pushed David Cameron into No 10 with a Commons majority?Mr Cameron had two simple messages in the campaign and he rarely veered away from them; the first - the economy is in good shape and the recovery is threatened by Labour. And the second - the SNP would hold a Labour-led government to ransom.Read more from Jonny Dymond hereBrian Taylor, BBC political editor, ScotlandOf all the comments on the overnight apocalypse, undoubtedly the most straightforward came from a defeated Scottish Labour MP.Since there were quite a few of them, let me narrow the focus a little. Come on down, Tom Harris.Mr Harris had plainly anticipated defeat. Nonetheless, he looked suitably lugubrious as his fate was confirmed.Why, he was asked eagerly, had Labour lost? ""Because we did not win enough votes.""Psephologically, it is perfect. Complete in itself. Psychologically, it sums up Labour's gloom without descending into subsidiary matters such as leadership, strategy and the rest. As a forward-thinking strategy, it is ideal. Win more votes. Simple.Read more from Brian Taylor hereThis has been an election which may have more profound consequences than almost any in living memory.We now face a generational decision about our future in Europe, with an EU referendum in two years' time almost certain.There will also be serious questions about the future of the Union, following an SNP landslide that has turned Scotland into a virtual one-party state.David Cameron's victory also represents a colossal achievement.Only once before in recent history has an incumbent government increased its majority - and that was Mrs Thatcher in her prime in the 1980s.It is also a significant personal victory for Mr Cameron and a rebuff for those in his party who had become increasingly sceptical about his ability to win.But while it may represent a defeat for those Tories who saw this election as a potential opportunity to rid themselves of David Cameron, he must now govern with a wafer-thin majority.For the SNP, their stunning victory can only increase the pressure on Nicola Sturgeon to include a commitment to a second independence referendum in her party's manifesto for next year's Scottish elections.It is an election which has not just defied all the predictions of the pollsters and pundits - but which may yet prompt the most fundamental re-casting of British politics for a generation.Read more from Norman Smith hereAfter an extraordinary night, some brief conclusions:Read more from James Landale hereIs this the end of the union?That is the question many people will be asking this morning after the party which has fought for Scottish independence for 80 years swept to victory.The answer from the jubilant Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon is a firm ""No"".She insists that her MPs will speak for all of Scotland, not just for the 45% who voted for the country to leave the United Kingdom last September.In the closing hours of the most extraordinary election campaign which anyone in Scotland can remember, Ms Sturgeon turned to talk of ""legitimacy.""That will be her watchword in the coming days as she argues that the prime minister cannot ignore the democratic will of the Scottish people.Politically, Scotland and England this morning look and feel like very different countries.Read more from James Cook hereAfter weeks of chatter about an election too close to call, it wasn't that close at all.David Cameron will be continuing as our prime minister.So, what is all this likely to mean?A referendum on whether the UK stays in, or leaves, the European Union, within the next two-and-a-half years.A race to be the next leader of the Labour Party.A race to be the next leader of the Liberal Democrats.And a huge new presence of Scottish National Party MPs at Westminster.And so here's another thing we know for certain this morning: Politics ain't going to be boring any time soon.Read more from Chris Mason hereFor Labour the story of their terrible night is rapidly turning into the search for a new leader. So who will that be?Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, is almost certain to run.  Even before this election, both he and another almost inevitable candidate, Chuka Umunna, had raised eyebrows inside the party at the work they had put in, preparing the ground with members and the unions for potential bids.Yvette Cooper, before the election, was still thought not to have made up her mind over whether to run. That decision has been made perhaps a little easier as her husband, Ed Balls, has lost his seat.She is certainly potentially in the frame, along with two lesser known names - Liz Kendall and Dan Jarvis - two MPs who were only elected in 2010 for the first time. This could be their moment. But whoever is in the job, they face a monumental task.Read Laura Kuenssberg's Twitter hereSterling is up (the most for seven years against the euro), share prices are up (especially bank shares like Lloyds and RBS, and energy shares such as Centrica), government bond prices are up.To state the obvious, investors love the Tories' general election victory.There are a few reasons.One (no surprise here) is that Labour's threat of breaking up banks and imposing energy price caps has been lifted.Second is that investors have been discounting days and weeks of wrangling after polling day over who would form the government - and so they are semi-euphoric that we already know who's in charge.Third, many investors tend to be economically conservative and instinctively Conservative.But although the City may be a bit drunk on the result, its pleasure in Ed Miliband's and Ed Balls' humiliation may be making it a bit blind - perhaps dangerously so - to some bumps in the economic road ahead.Read more from Robert Peston hereNigel Farage dreamed of holding the balance of power, but in the end his UKIP party is now worse off than when it came into the election.At the seventh time of asking he was rejected - this time by the people of Thanet South. It was a similar story in Rochester and Strood where Mark Reckless, who sensationally defected from the Tories last year, was also sent packing.In seats on UKIP's target list, like Thurrock in Essex, the party failed to make gains. In Grimsby - where Mr Farage went twice in the last six weeks - they came third.UKIP got around four million votes - with especially strong showings in north-east and south-east England - but it's ended up with just one MP, and a vacancy at the top. This has led to UKIP attacking the current system of choosing MPs, which it's described as ""busted"" and ""dysfunctional"".In one sense, this campaign was a complete failure and it's left an aftermath of angry voters, and others wondering if the UKIP bubble has burst.Read Robin Brant's Twitter hereI monitored 91 GB-wide voting intention polls during the 2015 election campaign and found nothing in them to prepare me for the final outcome.The good news for the pollsters was that their share for the Lib Dems was pretty close, as were the shares for UKIP, the Greens and the catch-all category of Others.The bad news for the polling industry was that the crucial shares for Conservative and Labour were the ones where they came most adrift.When all the qualifications of margins of error are allowed, there did appear to be a systematic overstatement of the Labour share and an equally systematic understatement of the Conservative one.It is for the pollsters to decide whether to conduct a review of their performance but I trust they will avoid the initial knee-jerk reaction of the immediate aftermath of the 1992 polls debacle.This general election performance follows the performance of the polls in the 2014 Scottish referendum where the choice was simply binary and yet all the polls were out by between 4-6%.Something is wrong. A lot of us would like to know what it is.Read more from David Cowling hereThe words ""political earthquake"" have been translated into numerous European languages, making front page news across the continent.While Britons now examine the domestic minutiae of the election result, here in mainland Europe the vote means one thing: a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU. And that has the potential to create an earthquake of its own.The guardian of the EU treaties Mr Cameron wants to change - Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker - has said again he'd listen to what Britain's new government proposed.Read more from Katya Adler here"

He's not the only party leader to face an attempted ousting. But can you recover from such a revolt?In 2006, the Labour prime minister was the target of what became known as the ""curry house conspiracy"" - a coup to remove him and install his chancellor, Gordon Brown, as prime minister.It would lead to several of the plotters' resignations - but not Mr Blair's. However, it was successful to a degree in that it forced the party leader into naming a departure date.The move against him was reportedly masterminded by Tom Watson, a defence minister at the time, who was also rumoured to have had a secret meeting with Mr Brown on the eve of the revolt.Apparently, Mr Watson and three fellow West Midlands MPs - Sion Simon, David Wright (both ministerial aides) and Khalid Mahmood - met over a biryani at a Wolverhampton curry house to discuss the PM's future, before dispatching a missive calling for him to quit.The letter - which attracted the support of a number of normally loyal Labour MPs - was leaked to the press, and ultimately resulted in Mr Watson's resignation.In his parting letter, the West Bromwich East MP took a shot at the prime minister, who he said should step down in the interests of party and country.Mr Blair denounced his actions and branded the former minister ""disloyal, discourteous and wrong"", saying he would have sacked him if he had not resigned.But Mr Watson's departure was swiftly followed by the resignations of six other junior members of government - who had also signed the rebel letter - in protest at the prime minister's refusal to say when he would step down as Labour leader.The whole affair resulted in Mr Blair announcing his intention to step aside within 12 months - which he duly did, on 27 June 2007.But it did nothing to quash internal dissent and speculation in the party over the future leadership of the party.Labour prime minister Gordon Brown found his leadership under threat in 2009 after one of his cabinet ministers dramatically quit the government and called for him to resign.Work and Pensions Secretary James Purnell - a former aide to Tony Blair - resigned from his post after the polls closed in the local and European elections, in which Labour was forecast to do badly.Explaining his decision to quit, Mr Purnell said the prime minister made a Conservative victory ""more, not less, likely"".It was Mr Brown's first direct challenge from a cabinet minister - but it would not topple the Labour leader as senior members of government refused to follow Mr Purnell's lead.Mr Brown was safe for the time being. But several months later, in January 2010, a fresh leadership challenge was mounted by two senior former Labour cabinet ministers.Geoff Hoon and Patricia Hewitt wrote to all Labour MPs, saying the party was ""deeply divided"" over Mr Brown's leadership and that the best way to resolve the issue was by way of secret ballot.They insisted it was not an ""attempted coup"" but a necessary step to resolve divisions within the party.But the duo could only muster the public support of a handful of backbenchers long-opposed to Mr Brown, with the majority of the party's MPs less than impressed by the move, which came just weeks before the general election.As the day wore on, a succession of cabinet ministers came out to back the PM, suggesting there was little momentum behind the plot - although it was noted that several were not exactly gushing in their support of Mr Brown.As history tells us, neither leadership challenge bore fruit but they reflected the internal doubts and divisions over Mr Brown at the helm.As leadership toppling attempts go, this one in 2014 was regarded as a particularly ""botched"" and ""shambolic coup"". Indeed, former Lib Dem leader Lord (Paddy) Ashdown described the move as a ""plot of deep malice"".Its instigator, Lord (Matthew) Oakeshott - a close ally of the-then Business Secretary Vince Cable - tried to unseat Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg.The peer was found to have commissioned secret polls suggesting the party would do better at the 2015 general election without Mr Clegg in the driving seat.The man Lord Oakeshott had long had in mind to take Mr Clegg's place - Mr Cable, who was on government business in China at the time - was forced to publicly condemn his friend's actions and state his backing for Mr Clegg.But Lord Oakeshott said the business secretary had in fact known about his polls and their findings.Nevertheless, the peer - who was denounced by the Lib Dem leadership for spending money that could have been spent on campaigning - quit the party, and issued a warning shot on his way out about the Lib Dems' future prospects.Mr Cable largely emerged unscathed but he faced questions about his loyalty to the leader. Although the two sought to put paid to reports of a rift with a (painfully awkward, 'nothing to see here, folks') stage-managed pint in a pub.Although the revolt failed, and Mr Clegg remained at the helm, the Lib Dems did go on to suffer a trouncing at the general election, losing nearly 50 of its MPs - one of them, Mr Cable himself - prompting his leader to quit.The Conservatives have a reputation for being more ruthless than their party rivals when it comes to getting rid of leaders they sense are no longer effectual.But, in 1995, Prime Minister John Major - tired of persistent rumours of a leadership challenge - decided to take the bull by the horns and trigger a surprise leadership election to silence his detractors.His own backbenchers had questioned Mr Major's ability to unite and lead the party, which was deeply divided over Europe.So ""put up or shut up"", he told them as he tendered his resignation as Conservative Party leader but not prime minister.But then stepped forward eurosceptic MP John Redwood, who resigned from the cabinet in order to contest Mr Major's leadership.This was unexpected by many, as the PM had said there had been assurances from his cabinet that none would stand against him.But Mr Major went on to win the ensuing election with a comfortable defeat over his challenger, who was not included in the PM's consequent cabinet reshuffle.No further contested leadership election took place until after the Conservatives' defeat at the 1997 general election, paving the way for William Hague to take over the running of the party.Not all attempts to oust a party leader end in failure: as Margaret Thatcher found out to her peril.With three electoral victories under her belt, the Conservative prime minister's downfall would come at the hands of her own party - not the voters.It was on 1 November 1990 when Geoffrey (now Lord) Howe - one of Mrs Thatcher's longest-serving ministers - resigned over differences with the party leader over Europe.In his now infamous speech on the floor of the House of Commons, he attacked the PM's policies and leadership style, comparing being one of her cabinet ministers to opening the batting at cricket only to find his bat had been ""broken... by the team captain"".It sparked the beginning of the end of the 11-year Thatcher reign.Michael (now Lord) Heseltine seized on the opportunity to challenge the prime minister in the ensuing leadership contest, from which she would eventually withdraw and John Major emerge as her successor. Reflecting on the revolt and its implications on the Conservative Party, Baroness Thatcher's biographer Charles Moore wrote: ""Because the coup was unjustified, and so trust broke down, the politics of the next 15 years were those of civil war."""
2015-04-21,Election swings and roundabouts,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-32741924,"If election manifesto claims are all about smoke and mirrors, should we now add swings and roundabouts to the political metaphor?There's an intriguing aspect to the general election results in the Midlands that puzzled me.It's the striking contrast in the swings between Labour and the Conservatives.David Cameron and his campaign strategists knew they were home and dry when Nuneaton was the first Midlands marginal to declare.It was not only a Tory hold but a swing to the Conservatives from Labour of 3%.I was in the Nottingham suburb of Beeston awaiting the result of the Broxtowe count. Would its high profile Conservative MP Anna Soubry survive a red surge?Nuneaton set the pattern. Across the Midlands, both east and west, there was a uniform swing of between three and four per cent to the Tories - Warwickshire North 3%, Amber Valley 4%, Derbyshire South 4% and Sherwood 4%. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan topped the Tory swingometer in the Midlands marginals with 5% in Loughborough.Yet in the big cities, it was a very different story. The swing went to Labour.So in Nottingham East they enjoyed a 6% swing, Nottingham South 5.8%, Leicester South 7.3%, Leicester West 5%, Birmingham Hall Green 12%, Birmingham Hodge Hill 8%.If swings to Labour on this scale had gone beyond the city ring road roundabouts and into the suburbs, Ed Miliband would have become prime minister by now.In confidence, one senior Labour insider in Nottingham told me its success in the city wards was down to organisation, experience and its teams of activists.""We won the ground war. If Nottingham's city boundaries were extended into Sherwood and Broxtowe, we would have won those constituencies as well,"" he told me.Labour leadership candidate, Leicester West's Liz Kendall has identified her party's problem beyond the ring road roundabout.It's about reaching out to Middle England.""We need to show people that we understand their aspirations and ambitions for the future,"" she told the Sunday Times.The problem for Labour was that Middle England was not interested in what the party offered…and still isn't. The Cameron brand worked its magic in those Midlands marginals... it'll take something or someone special to break up that ballot box relationship."
2015-04-21,Royal 'lobbying',https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32740154,"Prince Charles sent 27 letters to then Prime Minister Tony Blair and members of his government between September 2004 and March 2005, ""despite the Freedom of Information Act!"" as the prince joked in one.But did his suggestions and concerns have any bearing on the behaviour of Mr Blair's government?The request: Prince Charles expresses his worries over an EU directive on complementary medicines ""which is… effectively outlawing the use of certain herbal extracts"".  Mr Blair replied, offering moral support and practical help. He agreed that ""the implementation as it is currently planned is crazy"" and set out an action plan that included delaying implementation for all existing products to 2011. What happened: Herbal products were not required to be authorised until 2011, just as Mr Blair had promised. Prince Charles continues to sell his own brand of complementary products, Duchy Herbals, through Boots and Waitrose. The request: Writing to Mr Blair, the prince expresses a ""growing sense of anxiety"" that the Hill Farming Allowance, which supports farmers working on Britain's uplands, could be scrapped. In his reply, the prime minister said he understood that the Hill Farm Allowance would continue until 2007. What happened: The allowance lasted until the end of Labour's tenure in 2010, when it was abolished.The request: Just 18 months after the US-led invasion of Iraq, Prince Charles raised the issue of poor performance of Lynx helicopters in high temperatures, saying: ""I fear that this is just one more example of where our Armed Forces are being asked to do an extremely challenging job (particularly in Iraq) without the necessary resources.""Mr Blair replied: ""On the subject of the Lynx helicopter, the limitations of the existing platform, particularly in the extremely challenging environment within Iraq, are well recognised by the Ministry of Defence."" He added that replacement of the helicopters would be a priority. What happened: Mr Blair's comments go much further than what he was saying about the subject at the time. In the event, though, the fleet was not fully upgraded until 2011.The request: Prince Charles lamented that the government's TB prevention plans might not ""include a commitment to deal with the badger problem in the immediate future"" and pushed strongly for a cull, saying: ""All I can say is that I do urge you to look again at introducing a proper cull of badgers where it is necessary.""Mr Blair sympathised, saying he could ""personally see the case for culling badgers"". However, he was unwilling to commit to a cull.  What happened: Culling trials were conducted from 1998-2005. The final results, published in 2008, said that the badger cull could ""make no meaningful contribution"" to curbing bovine TB. It wasn't until 2013 that a full culling programme began in two pilot areas. These ended with the conclusion that the pilots had been neither humane nor effective at curbing the spread of TB.The request: Then Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell wrote to Prince Charles to say she had decided to give parts of the historic Smithfield meat market Grade II listed status, and was trying to persuade deputy prime minister John Prescott to ""call in"" the planning application to prevent demolition of other parts of the site. She had been swayed by evidence provided by Sir Neil Cossons, who was English Heritage chair at the time, after he had been asked by the prince to add his support. Prince Charles replied that he was ""extremely glad to read of your appreciation of the value of this group of buildings"". According to the Guardian, market workers desperate to see the redevelopment of the site invited the prince to meet them to discuss it, but his office said he was ""unlikely to accept as he did not want to interfere in the planning process"".What happened: Smithfield market is still the subject of planning battles a decade on. Successive planning applications have been refused by ministers. Last year then Communities Secretary Eric Pickles rejected plans for an office development on the site, stating that ""the extent of damage that the application would cause to the important heritage assets at Smithfield runs entirely counter to national and policy objectives intended to protect such assets from harm"".In March, the Museum of London announced a move from its current Barbican site to the Smithfield market building."
2015-04-21,Election fallout,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32703139,"""Some of those gimmicks - that tombstone, whatever idiot thought that up I do not know!""I was talking to the former Mayor of Crawley in Sussex, John Mortimer, in the town's Labour Supporters Club about the vexed question of what went wrong, and where Labour should go next. This seat is one of those southern seats Labour hoped to take, but failed.I hear a whole range of views in the club.""They didn't give nothing to depend on, they should be clear, and a little bit more down to Earth."" ""Good party, wrong leader, they don't look after business enough.""Councillor John Stanley tells me: ""I think in a way we did go too left, but now we can go a bit centre-left, or centre, depending who the new leader is.""The former mayor sums up the mood on the doorstep: ""Whatever we told them, they didn't believe us.""  Expect to hear all those views, and more, in the coming leadership contest. Step back from the angst of supporters, and it may not be that hard to see why Labour failed.  An economic recovery, hailed by independent organisations as the result of government policy, undid a party that had loudly proclaimed for five years that the coalition's policies would lead to economic disaster. Combine that with an uncharismatic and uninspirational leader, then you might argue no further debate is necessary.Fat chance of that. Defeat breeds resentment, and this one has opened up old divisions.  A chorus of Blairties, led by the man himself, has declared that Ed's problem was ignoring those with aspiration and ambition, failing to appeal to those running business. Incidentally, I've been ticked off by the perspicacious editor of the New Statesman, Jason Cowley, for using the ""unhelpful"" term ""Blairites"".I can't think of another description that fits Tony, Lord Mandelson, Lord Adonis and David Miliband quite so well. But call them what you will, the message was clear - Ed was too left wing, Labour should move back to the centre, or, if you like, to the right.Reading Mr Blair's pithy analysis, listening to Lord Mandelson's gripping and savage eloquence, describing a party sent out to shout: ""We love the poor and hate the rich,"" and so ignoring the middle, and you realise strong emotions are in play.But back to the future may not be sufficient. Of course elections are won on the centre ground. But grandees grinding axes, affronted by the failure of boys who used to make their tea, may be creating so much noise that they can't hear more insistent sounds.  For there are several elephants trumpeting loudly as they cram into the small space of the shadow cabinet room. Imagine these beasts are as gaily decorated as Berlin buddy bears. One is decked out in red, another in imperial purple bunting, and another, a mammoth, strong tusked and ice rimmed, painted yellow with tartan trimmings.Take the last first. The Scottish wipeout is Labour's biggest problem. Fail to solve it, and Labour can forget ever having a comfortable majority again. It is hard to argue Labour were wiped out in Scotland because the SNP outflanked them to the right with their appeal to the business community and the ambitious and aspirational. But it is true the SNP drew in to people from left, right and centre, just as the modernisers say Labour should. It was the politics of economic self-interest, but cast in a very different light. Tribally sneering at ""the reactionary ideology of nationalism"" as Mr Blair does, will not reach the central belt of Scotland, the middle ground of  Midlothian.What about that purple pachyderm?  In Crawley - in fact in seat after seat - there is a similar pattern.  Labour did, in fact, often increase the size of their vote. So did the Conservatives, usually by a bit more. But the real dynamic was the total collapse of the Lib Dems and the dramatic rise of UKIP. The increase in votes for Nigel Farage's party wasn't translated into parliamentary seats, but, although it is early days in terms of research, it probably hurt Labour a lot. If we believe - and I do - Matthew Goodwin and Rob Ford, authors of Revolt on the Right, these voters are often former Labour supporters - older, less educated, those left behind on the tides of  globalisation, stranded on the shores of post-industrialisation. They may have had too many disappointments to feel much ambition or aspiration. They are a challenge for Labour, and any new leader will spend a good deal of time thinking how to deal with the concerns of Europe and immigration.Whether to share their fears, or confront them will be a big decision.Which brings us to Red Nellie. Those members who still proudly call themselves socialist. This is not about Old Labour - they are more likely to be baristas or barristers than boilermakers. It is easy as an outsider, as a journalist, to treat politics as an intellectual game about how best to win power - but many people, particularly the foot soldiers, particularly after the death of  purely tribal loyalties, are in it because they passionately believe in winning  power to do something specific.Many of them are suspicious of the later incarnations of New Labour, not because it reached an accommodation with wealth and business, but because it seemed to worship at the same altar, to regard the party's core beliefs in redistribution and equality as childish fantasies from a past age.Perhaps to Mr Blair, they are the problem, people who may equate ""ambition"" with greed. They might point out that a man who claims to be worth ""only"" £20m may find it harder than most to squeeze through the eye of a needle to understand their point of view. Most successful Labour leaders will confront the left at some point, but the concerns of this group go to the existential question ""What is the party for?""This is not a polemic - not an argument about what should be done, but a reflection on the complex conundrums that will face any new Labour leader, the tearing apart of the old alliance that made up a Labour majority, and so the political need to satisfy groups with very different, indeed, contradictory demands. But looking for a Social Democratic universal theory of everything may be missing the point. What the party desperately wants is a leader who can pull the disparate threads together and articulate them as common purpose. Whether she or he exists is another matter.Much more on that in the coming months."
2015-04-21,'Take us with you',https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-32736153,"Thousands of people in the north of England have been using the hashtag ""take us with you Scotland"" to express their upset about the result of last week's general election, and Scottish nationalists are welcoming this English minority with open arms. Last Thursday's general election was a rough one for the Labour Party in its traditional stronghold in the north of England. But further to the north, the left-leaning Scottish National Party won nearly every seat it contested. That political contrast has made some left-wing voters in places like Manchester, Leeds and Sheffield look fondly on their neighbours. Since last Thursday's election in Britain the phrase ""take us with you Scotland"" has been used more than 24,000 times. ""Genuinely beginning to wonder if the North of England becoming a part of Scotland would be better for us, I really am,"" tweeted Aaron Miller from Yorkshire. Some cracked jokes under the tag after the North West Motorway Police account, which gives traffic updates, announced that they had ""picked up a pedestrian on the M62 who was trying to walk to Scotland.""After an initial spike of jokes over the weekend, the hashtag really took off when users start to mobilise in support of around a year-old petition on the campaigning site Change.org. The petition calls for the north of England to secede from the rest of the country and join up with Scotland, and more than 12,000 people have signed it.Its creator, a Sheffield resident who calls himself ""Stu Dent"", set it up to coincide with last year's Scottish independence referendum, and he also created a map imagining the boundary of a ""Scotland plus the north"" country.Stu Dent runs the Twitter account Hunters Bar, named after an area of southwest Sheffield which is very popular with - you guessed it - students. Despite the account having thousands of followers on Twitter, when the map was first posted last year, the image was shared only about 100 times - however, in the past week it's been retweeted by thousands. Stu Dent told BBC Trending that he was surprised at how popular his idea has become. ""In hindsight, perhaps I shouldn't have been,"" he said. ""There is a huge frustration in parts of the UK about the things that have happened since 2010.""""I think people need a place to go where they can say 'not in my name! This is not the England I want',"" he added. But in addition to disappointment from some quarters about the election result, there might be another reason why the petition is getting a boost now: the power of the Scottish Nationalists on Twitter. What started as a post-election joke in the North of England was quickly embraced by the so-called ""Cyber Nats"" - and a trend was born.The SNP's social media strategist Ross Colquhoun expressed the party's mood about the hashtag best, in a post which was shared more than 500 times.

2015-04-21,What Britain wants from Europe,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32695399,"David Cameron says he has a mandate to pursue EU reform following the Conservatives' general election victory. The PM, who will be hoping his majority government will give him extra leverage in Brussels, wants to renegotiate the terms of the UK's membership ahead of a referendum by the end of 2017. He has said he will campaign for Britain to remain in the EU if he gets the reforms he wants.Mr Cameron has said he does not want to reveal full details of his negotiating hand but he has given a broad indication, in a series of speeches and newspaper articles, of his priorities when he goes into talks with other EU leaders.These are: The prime minister has said Britain would resist any move towards a European Army and that he wants to free British police forces from EU interference. He has also ruled out Britain joining the euro.But he has placed less emphasis in recent years on demanding changes to EU social policy, such as the maximum 48-hour working week, agency workers, maternity leave and non-discrimination rules.The official UK government position is that a referendum will be held by the end of 2017 but Downing Street sources have said: ""If we can do it earlier we will.""There is speculation David Cameron is planning to hold the vote in 2016 to avoid a clash with French and German elections in 2017.The prime minister wants treaty change but even if the referendum was held in 2017 there may not be enough time to legally incorporate any reforms into a treaty and it would have to be done at a later stage.An early referendum would anger Eurosceptics who believe it would not allow enough time to make the case for exit or negotiate any meaningful concessions.""A rushed process would severely undermine the chances to secure a significant deal that both British business and voters could support and would waste the opportunity of a lifetime,"" Matthew Elliott, chief executive of Business for Britain told Breitbart London.The question is always crucial in any referendum and there is already a debate about what it should be. The Draft European Union (Referendum) Bill, published by the Conservatives in 2013, proposed this form of words: ""Do you think that the United Kingdom should remain a member of the European Union?""Some thought that leaned too far towards the status quo, encouraging a yes vote, and the Electoral Commission said it was not clear and direct enough. The watchdog proposed this form of words instead: ""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union?""The new Conservative government will attempt to repeal the Human Rights Act, which requires UK courts to treat the European Court of Human Rights as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. The European Court of Human Rights is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe (CoE), which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine.The freedom for people to move around Europe, enshrined in the EU treaties, works in parallel with the other three basic freedoms in the single market: freedom of goods, capital and services.It is likely to be a ""red line"" for other EU leaders, who do not want to see it eroded.Mr Cameron has steered clear of tackling it directly - for example by asking for an emergency ""brake"" on free movement, or a cap on numbers - focusing instead on reducing the incentive provided by welfare payments. In a speech last November, David Cameron set out measures to reduce the number of EU nationals moving to the UK.His main proposals were:Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission, has said he is ready to work with Mr Cameron to ""strike a fair deal for the United Kingdom in the EU"". The leaders of other EU nations have previously warned they are unlikely to support major changes to EU treaties to accommodate British demands. But Mr Cameron's general election victory may have given him extra leverage. ""The ball is very much in the court of the UK now,"" a senior EU official told The Guardian. ""It's up to the British to define what they want."" The key figure will be German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is very keen to keep Britain in the EU but has so far been unwilling to make major concessions to enable that to happen. There are fears that a ""pick and mix"" approach to EU treaties would undermine EU cohesion.Mr Cameron has said there is ""no doubt"" his planned reforms will require changes to the treaties governing the European Union. But this would require the unanimous support of all EU members, and may not be possible within the deadline he has set of a referendum before the end of 2017. Any attempt to change EU laws on free movement would meet fierce resistance from some EU nations, particularly Eastern European states. Mr Juncker has said free movement is non-negotiable.Mr Cameron may find it difficult to get unanimous support for his proposals for a four-year waiting period for migrant workers claiming UK benefits. East European EU members would be likely to oppose this, on the grounds that it would discriminate against their citizens.  Attempts to secure opt-outs for the City are unlikely to go down well with other European leaders.However, there are precedents for EU treaty changes to accommodate some countries' specific concerns - for example, the protocol attached to the Lisbon Treaty for Ireland.Mr Cameron has faced repeated calls to say whether he would campaign for Britain's exit from the EU in the referendum if he fails to get what he wants from the renegotiation process. All he has said is that he will ""rule nothing out"". Some Conservative MPs want Britain to leave the EU no matter what David Cameron manages to renegotiate. A larger group are likely to want more concessions than Mr Cameron has so far indicated he is prepared to demand.Senior backbencher David Davis, who was defeated by Mr Cameron for the Tory leadership in 2005, told the Daily Telegraph the majority of the 332 Conservative MPs want Mr Cameron to negotiate an ""opt-out"" power to stop individual EU laws from applying to Britain. The prime minister has said this would be ""impossible"" without Britain leaving the EU.Mr Davis claims as many as 60 Tory MPs would be prepared to rebel and vote for Britain's exit from the EU if the prime minister fails to deliver.Graham Brady, chairman of the Tory backbench 1922 committee, which represents backbenchers, has urged David Cameron to give all Conservative MPs, including ministers, a free vote in the EU referendum.In January, Mr Cameron warned that serving cabinet ministers would have to quit the government if they wanted to campaign to leave the EU if he had secured the reforms to it he wants.In the 1975 referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Economic Community, as the EU was then called, Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson decided to suspend collective responsibility because his cabinet was split on the issue. Ministers were allowed to vote with their consciences and campaign against each other. The majority of them, including Mr Wilson, joined the Yes camp, but left-wingers, such as Tony Benn, played a leading role in the No campaign. The Yes campaign won easily with 67% of the vote."

Mr Murphy said he would tender his resignation alongside a plan to reform the party.He lost his seat in last week's general election as the SNP won 56 of the 59 Scottish seats, leaving Labour with a single MP in Scotland.Mr Murphy said he wanted to have a successor as leader in place by the summer, and confirmed he would not be standing for a seat at the Scottish Parliament in next year's election. Instead, he said it was time to ""do something else"" and that he believed the party would continue to be divided if he remained as leader. His deputy, Kezia Dugdale MSP, will become acting leader until a permanent successor is found. Mr Murphy had faced calls to resign from several MSPs, trade unions and former MPs in the wake of his party's near wipeout at the general election.He insisted he had decided to stand down ahead of the national executive voting by 17-14 in favour of him staying in the job.Speaking at a media conference after the national executive meeting, he said: ""It is clear that a small minority who didn't accept my election as leader of the Scottish Labour Party just five months ago won't accept the vote of the executive today and that will continue to divide the party.""Today I received more support in the executive vote than I did from members of the executive when I stood for election five months ago.""He said it would be up to the executive whether to accept the reforms he would be proposing before he left the post. But he warned: ""A party in such urgent need of reform blocks those changes at its peril.""The former East Renfrewshire MP said Labour had been crushed between ""two nationalisms"" in Scotland and England.Mr Murphy said he left no legacy of bitterness for anyone in the Labour Party, and the only person he was angry at was the person who blamed Scottish Labour for the party's UK-wide general election defeat - a reference to Unite leader Len McCluskey.And he said that in many ways Scottish Labour was the ""least modernised part of the Labour movement"" and that he wanted his successor to be elected under a one member, one vote system.Mr Murphy added: ""The Labour Party's problem is not the link with trade unions, or even the relationship with Unite members - far from it. It is the destructive behaviour of one high profile trade unionist.""The leader of the Scottish Labour Party doesn't serve at the grace of Len McCluskey, and the next leader of the UK Labour Party should not be picked by Len McCluskey.""Mr McCluskey has been a vocal critic of Mr Murphy's leadership and opposed his appointment in December when Mr Murphy won the contest to replace Johann Lamont.Jim Murphy laughed and joked with Scottish Labour's sole MP as he made his way down the hotel corridor to announce his resignation.He certainly brought energy and dynamism to his election campaign - but all that achieved was Ian Murray in Edinburgh South.So as Mr Murphy bows out, who could replace him?The deputy leader Kezia Dugdale may want to step up or Neil Findlay could try again after challenging last time. Maybe the party's finance spokeswoman Jackie Baillie thinks her steady hand could steer the ship.Jenny Marra is also often talked about as future face of the party.Whoever steps into Jim Murphy's red shoes he or she will have to face a difficult 2016 Holyrood election, to put it mildly.There are also more fundamental questions about how the party can possibly move on as it faces a surging SNP.Mr Murphy was very much a creature of ""New Labour"" - but to today's generation that's old Labour.Party members may start looking for someone with no links to the past, neither a Brownite nor a Blairite. A 'cleanskin' - as the politicos put it - may well help re-connect with voters.That's a long way from now though - even some of the party's opponents may view this latest train wreck with a modicum of sympathy. Ms Lamont had resigned after claiming Scottish Labour was treated like a ""branch office"" by the London-based party leadership.Mr Murphy concluded his speech by saying: ""Scotland needs a strong Labour party; Scotland needs a united Labour party. We have been the greatest force for change in our nation's remarkable history. ""The Scottish Labour party will rise again. It will be under someone else's leadership and I am confident about my party's future.""Harriet Harman MP, acting leader of the UK Labour Party, said it would be for Scottish Labour to choose a new leader. She added: ""As a cabinet minister and leader of his party in Scotland, Jim has been a hugely important figure in the Labour Party. He leaves with the best wishes and thanks of our movement.""Labour peer Lord McConnell, a former Scottish first minister, said the party's problems were ""much deeper than one individual and one affiliate"".He said: ""We have a disconnect locally and nationally with wider Scottish society. ""We have a problem with our political positioning in the post devolution age where the party particularly at the UK level has never been comfortable with success in the Scottish parliament and has always tried to see things through a UK prism rather than a Scottish prism.""We need to find a new generation, a new leader, new generation, new ideas, a fresh approach.""In a tweet, Scottish first minister and SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said: ""I wish Jim Murphy all the very best for the future. Leadership is not easy and he deserves credit for standing up for what he believes in.""Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson also reacted on Twitter, saying: ""Jim Murphy announces a managed exit in order to help the party, which is to his credit. But leaves a tough gig for whoever comes next.""The meeting of Scottish Labour's executive was disrupted by protesters who entered the party's headquarters.Police were called and the protesters, who included persistent anti-austerity activists Sean Clerkin and Piers Doughty-Brown, left the building to protest further from the street outside.The protesters were calling for Mr Murphy to remain as leader to ""finish the job of destroying Scottish Labour"".A Police Scotland spokeswoman said officers had been called and found two protestors on the third floor of the building. She added: ""Both left on police arrival. Advice and assistance was given."""
2015-04-22,Labour contenders clash on spending,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32761561,"Prospective Labour leaders have clashed over Labour's record in government in their first public debate in the race to succeed Ed Miliband.Former cabinet ministers including Yvette Cooper and Andy Burnham defended Labour's fiscal record and spending on schools and hospitals.However, candidates from the 2010 intake of MPs argued that the party spent too much while in office.The debate followed Chuka Umunna's withdrawal from the leadership contest.The remaining candidates appeared at the annual conference of the Progress think tank in London.There was agreement that Labour needed to demonstrate economic credibility to regain power, with shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt telling the meeting that the party needed to be ""trusted with public finances and the family finances"".Mr Hunt, who was first elected to Parliament in 2010 when Labour lost power, argued the last Labour government ""spent too much"" and failed to ""leave enough economic headroom to deal with the economic crisis and the recession"".Shadow health minister Liz Kendall said: ""There's absolutely nothing progressive about spending more on debt interest payments than on educating our children.""But shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: ""The Tories have had a triumph of spin over the facts in saying what they said about the economic record of the last Labour government.""The former chief secretary to the Treasury said the deficit did ""grow too large"" in the government's later years but insisted: ""The last Labour government ran more surpluses in its first term than the Tories did in 18 years.""Yvette Cooper, another former chief secretary to the Treasury, said: ""We should never let anybody tell us that it was too many teachers, doctors or nurses that caused Lehman Brothers bank in New York to crash.""Shadow international development secretary Mary Creagh said: ""People have forgotten the economic credibility that the last Labour government had.""She said Labour had built schools and hospitals that were ""treasured in our communities"".Ms Cooper, Mr Burnham, Ms Kendall and Ms Creagh have declared their intention to run for leader, while Mr Hunt told the conference he would make an announcement next week.At the same event, shadow energy secretary Caroline Flint announced she would be running for deputy leader.The Don Valley MP told the Today programme ahead of the debate that Labour lost the election because ""fundamentally the public did not trust us on the economy"".Exeter MP Ben Bradshaw has already announced a bid to be deputy, saying Labour ""must and could win the next election"", but only if it ""broadens its appeal by adopting sensible, centre-left politics which celebrate wealth creation and entrepreneurship"".Former Labour campaign co-ordinator Tom Watson is reported to be crowd-funding a deputy leadership bid, while Walthamstow MP Stella Creasy has said she is ""open to the question"" of running.Barnsley East MP and shadow transport secretary Michael Dugher - a fierce critic of Ed Miliband's election campaign - is to run Mr Burnham's campaign, according to the website LabourList.It is reported that Mr Burnham also has the backing of Labour peer Lord Falconer, who was lord chancellor and justice secretary under Tony Blair and was close to the former PM.Shadow culture secretary Chris Bryant has signalled his backing for Ms Cooper, tweeting that the next leader must be ""someone who's been tried in the fiery furnace of public opinion"".Mr Hunt said on Friday he would be be attending the debate - along with the other four hopefuls - to ""set out my analysis on how we begin to understand what went so wrong and why"".He added: ""We must use this leadership election to ask some very profound questions.""All voices in the party must be heard so that we can have a full and proper assessment as to why the politics of nationalism triumphed in Scotland and huge swathes of England, and how we have allowed the Conservative Party to present a more compelling vision for Britain to so many millions of people.""Speculation still surrounds shadow business secretary Mr Umunna's decision to pull out on Friday, when he said he was not ""comfortable"" with the ""pressure"" of being a candidate.As well as citing extensive pressure and scrutiny Mr Umunna also said he was ruling himself out because of concerns about the impact of the bid on his family.A rising star of the party, Mr Umunna was first elected to Parliament in 2010 - alongside Tristram Hunt and Liz Kendall - before joining the shadow cabinet.Asked about the candidate who might win, Conservative Chancellor George Osborne said: ""The Labour leadership contest has descended into farce.""But it's not actually about personalities. I don't think the Labour Party any more represents the working people of this country who aspire to a better life."""

I'm not suggesting he takes a break from being leader.""Clearly the national executive has the authority, they're the ruling body. ""I'm told that they made a decision. I'm told it was a procedurally correct decision, he is the leader but I think it's important that as leader he takes a break and I think it's important that we work out how these complex questions are answered by a team.""No one person has all the answers. I'm particularly concerned about tone, making sure we get a tone that ensures that the 27 million people who didn't vote for UKIP last week may be persuaded to vote for us in future.""The party has been beset by wrangling since Mr Farage agreed to stay on as leader, days after standing down after failing to get elected in Thanet South.He had pledged before the general election that he would quit the post if he failed to get elected to Parliament.Senior aide Matthew Richardson has left the party, following claims from MEP Patrick O'Flynn that Mr Farage had fallen under the influence of ""inexperienced"" advisers.UKIP has also confirmed the departure of Mr Farage's chief of staff Raheem Kassam.Mr Farage ruled out quitting as leader on BBC's Question Time on Thursday, saying he had ""phenomenal"" support, and has challenged his critics to decide whether they want to stay in the party.In his article, Mr Carswell had said that ""knowing how difficult it is to lead a party makes me admire Nigel Farage all the more"".""I know that I never could,"" he added, stressing that he would find it ""impossible to simultaneously lead UKIP, be the voice of the party in the Commons, represent my Clacton constituents and at the same time be a husband and a dad"".However, he said that ""even leaders need to take a break"", adding: ""Nigel needs to take a break now.""UKIP got nearly four million votes at the election, but returned only one MP - former Conservative Mr Carswell in the Clacton constituency."

Under the plans, ministers could force schools rated as ""requiring improvement"" and missing new government benchmarks to become an academy.Coasting schools have average results which have often flatlined over time.Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, Mrs Morgan said faster action was needed.She said: ""Our big priorities will be to speed up the process for tackling failing schools; extend our academies programme to tackle 'coasting' schools; and deliver on our commitment to open new free schools.""The proposals will be in a new bill due to be introduced in the Queen's Speech. ""First, we will take new powers to step in from the moment that a school is found to be failing,"" Mrs Morgan said.""From day one, regional schools commissioners will be able to bring in new leadership and support from other excellent schools and heads, and we will speed up the process of turning schools into academies to make sure that new expert leadership is found for all schools that need it as quickly as possible.""She said that coasting schools will be put on an immediate notice to improve and could then be taken over and turned into an academy.They will be required to work with a team of ""expert"" head teachers.She said: ""Those that aren't able to demonstrate a clear plan for improvement will be given new leadership - we know this works in turning schools around.""More than 3,300 schools in England are labelled ""requires improvement"", but the plans are unlikely to cover that many schools.Under the current system, secondary schools are considered to be failing, and therefore eligible for intervention, if fewer than 40% of their students score at least five Cs at GCSE, including English and maths, and they do not meet national averages in pupil progress.In primary schools, the threshold for intervention is if fewer than 65% of pupils get Level 4 in reading, writing and maths and a below average number of pupils make the expected amount of progress.It is not yet clear how coasting schools will be deemed in need of intervention.It is understood that a new category will be devised covering schools which are rated as ""requires improvement"" and which fail to meet a new set of standards on improvement."
2015-04-22,Co-op Group to keep political funding,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-32762858,"The Co-operative Group has decided to continue financially supporting the Co-operative Party, which has strong ties to Labour.Members of the group, the UK's biggest mutual organisation, voted on the issue at their annual general meeting.They passed a motion by 48,579 for, to 39,479 against, to approve ""political expenditures"" of up to £1m which support the movement's objectives.Last year the Co-op Group gave £625,000 to the Co-op Party.This figure was down on the sums donated in previous years. The AGM also included a vote on new corporate governance procedures which would mean members having less of a direct say.The Co-operative Group is still recovering from a period of financial mismanagement and some members have recently expressed concerns about how elections to the board are chosen.The banking arm of the group came close to collapse in 2013, bringing the whole group to a £2.5bn annual loss that year. The Co-op Party includes among its members a number of Labour MPs, including shadow chancellor Chris Leslie and Walthamstow MP Stella Creasy. The politicians stand as candidates of both the Co-operative Party and the Labour Party, and the two political movements have strong historical ties. The board asked the members of the Co-operative Group whether they wanted to continue financially supporting the Co-operative Party, or any other party. Allan Leighton, chairman of the Co-op Group, said: ""There's a clear remit from the members to continue to support the Labour Party.""It allows us to now have a conversation with the Co-op Labour Party about what we do next.""There was also a members' motion on the agenda, put forward by those in favour of making political donations of up to £1m a year.The motion to approve political funding ""not to exceed £1m per annum"" was carried by 55.17% to 44.83%.BBC business correspondent Joe Lynam said: ""To meet a £1.5bn hole in its accounts - mostly stemming from its banking division - the Co-op Group has had to sell off parts of its businesses and hand over majority control of its bank to American hedge funds.""It's also in the process of radically changing the way it runs itself into a more corporate structure with less of a direct say by its members.""He said that ""in theory"", each of the 2.8 million Co-op members could vote on a series of motions about the reforms, as well as how its bosses are paid, and retaining the links to the Co-operative party.One of the group's largest independent societies, Midcounties, recently threatened legal action over a shortlist of six candidates for the group's board being reduced to three - the number of positions available - before a member vote.

2015-04-22,Osborne plans July 'stability' Budget,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32761566,"Chancellor George Osborne has said that he will deliver a new Budget on 8 July.He claimed it would have ""a laser-like focus"" on raising productivity and living standards.He said he was making the unusual move of having a second Budget in one year in order to ""deliver on the commitments we have made to working people"".Labour said the chancellor would have to set out ""who is going to pay"" for what it called ""uncosted promises"" in the election campaign.Speaking outside 11 Downing Street, the chancellor gave a broad outline of his plans for the forthcoming Budget but refused to be drawn on the details, including the Conservatives' planned £12bn of welfare cuts.""I don't want to wait to deliver on the commitments we have made to working people,"" he said.""It will continue with the balanced plan we have to deal with our debts, invest in our health service and reform welfare to make work pay.""But there will also be a laser-like focus on making our economy more productive so we raise living standards across our country.""We're going to put Britain into good shape for the long term.""The last Budget was held on 18 March and included tax cuts for first-time house buyers.Writing in the Sun, Mr Osborne admitted it was ""unusual"" to have two Budgets in the same year, but he wanted to turn ""promises made in the election into a reality"".Again, Mr Osborne did not specifically outline how the Conservatives plan to fulfil a pledge to cut £12bn in welfare spending but said he wants to make the welfare system ""fair for the people who pay for it"".He writes: ""We will protect the NHS and give it more funding each and every year, while making savings across Whitehall. ""We'll crack down hard on tax avoidance and aggressive tax planning by the rich - because everyone should pay their fair share.  ""We will always protect the most vulnerable, but we also need a welfare system that's fair to the people who pay for it. If you can work you should be working, so we'll take the next steps in our benefit reforms to make sure that happens.""Second, we've got to go on helping businesses create jobs in Britain, so we move towards full employment. That means facing a hard truth: in Britain we produce about a quarter less for every hour we work than countries like America or Germany. Fixing that long-running productivity weakness is the big challenge for the next five years.""So in the Budget we'll spend less on welfare, and instead invest to create three million more apprenticeships, so that young people can learn a trade, get better jobs and earn more.""After the Budget in March independent forecaster the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said that Mr Osborne needed to spell out exactly how he plans to cut £12bn from welfare spending.Of those £12bn planned cuts, £2bn were outlined ahead of the general election - all the cuts are supposed to be in place by 2017-18.Labour's shadow energy and climate change secretary, Caroline Flint, accused the Tories of making ""a number of uncosted promises"" during the election campaign.She told the BBC: ""It will be interesting to see who is going to pay for those uncosted policies when they bring the Budget in July."""

They absolutely loved how he helped them and he was a highly-regarded local MP,"" Mr Bone said.""He stood up for what was right rather than what the party line was. In those days - the John Major years - it was much more difficult to stand up against the party machine. He had strong views on Europe.""Sir Peter started his career as an insurance broker, joining the Wycombe Young Conservatives in 1949 and the Oxford University Conservative Association in 1951.He went on to become a Conservative councillor on Buckinghamshire County Council between 1961 and 1967.Wellingborough mayor-elect Barry Graves also paid tribute to Sir Peter, remembering him as a ""very strong constituency MP"".""I remember going out and canvassing with him and he would go everywhere. He knew the area and the people. He was very much a man of the local constituency.""He was ""a very approachable man"", Mr Graves added.Sir Peter was knighted in 1994. "

The Smith proposals included giving Holyrood the power to set income tax rates and bands, as well as control over a share of VAT and some welfare benefits. But Ms Sturgeon's SNP also wants the Scottish Parliament to be given powers over business taxes, employment law, the minimum wage and additional powers over welfare.Speaking after meeting Ms Sturgeon, Mr Cameron told the BBC: ""Let's make sure Smith is implemented in full. I'm going to keep the commitment I made to the people of Scotland. Let's get that done first because it does create a really strong Scottish Parliament.""He added: ""Of course, if people want to make future proposals I'll look at them.""The prime minister again said he did not support full fiscal autonomy for Scotland - the responsibility for all areas of tax and spending except defence and foreign affairs - stating that it would mean £7bn of cuts or extra tax-raising.What Nicola Sturgeon is trying to say is she has a mandate. She has 56 out of the 59 MPs elected in Scotland and she won 50% of the vote - unprecedented here in Scotland.She says that gives her leverage to push David Cameron. David Cameron says he wants to keep the nation together.The language coming out of Westminster last week was very much a cordial one. 'We will listen'.Nicola Sturgeon has warned him that if he doesn't listen, then the people of Scotland will judge him accordingly.Ms  Sturgeon described the hour-long talks at her official residence at Bute House as ""constructive and business-like"". She said Mr Cameron had made a ""commitment"" that the Smith proposals would be implemented ""as agreed"".""But secondly the prime minister agreed that he would look at proposals that we would now send to suggest the areas we can go beyond Smith,"" Ms Sturgeon said.""There was no agreement in terms of the substance of that but we will submit those proposals, the prime minister has said they will consider them and there will be a meeting to look at how we take that further forward.""Referring to her party's success in last week's general election, which saw the SNP win 56 out of 59 Scottish seats, Ms Sturgeon said: ""People in Scotland have now voted fairly convincingly for the SNP and sent a message that we want the Smith Commission proposals to go further and be built on.""The ball is in his court but I'm going into this in good faith.""She added: ""David Cameron and I are a world apart politically but, where we can, I'm determined to do business in the interests of the people of Scotland and across the UK.""She said she would have a ""constructive and business-like"" relationship with the prime minister. The two leaders shook hands on the front steps of Bute House as Mr Cameron arrived. Mr Cameron left the building shortly before 11:00, almost an hour after he had arrived.The two sides agreed to hold more regular discussions in the future, possibly quarterly. "
2015-04-22,Umunna withdraws Labour leader bid,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32748106,"Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna has withdrawn from the Labour party leadership contest, just days after throwing his hat into the ring.The MP, 36, said in a statement that he was not comfortable with the level of pressure and scrutiny that came with being a leadership candidate.Mr Umunna also cited concerns about the impact of the bid on his family.BBC political editor Nick Robinson said the MP's team insisted no ""unwelcome press story"" lay behind the move.But Mr Umunna had been shocked by the level of scrutiny of himself, his mother, sister and girlfriend, he said.You can follow the latest reaction here.A rising star of the party, Mr Umunna was first elected to Parliament in 2010 before joining the shadow cabinet.He confirmed his candidacy for the Labour leadership via a post on his Facebook page on 12 May, saying the party under Ed Miliband had failed to appeal to enough voters in England.But on Friday he said he had not found the leadership bid to be ""a comfortable experience"".I understand that Chuka Umunna has told friends that ""this is not right for me or people close to me. I'm human, the rest of my life is more important to me than politics.""The shadow business secretary has been distressed by the degree of scrutiny he, his family and his girlfriend have come under since he declared his intention to stand for the labour leadership.I am told that this includes reporters waiting outside the houses of relatives late at night.Friends of Mr Umunna deny that he is nervous of not getting the support of enough MPs to run for the leadership; they point out that he already has half the necessary names and that there are some weeks to go.The shadow business secretary now wants to play a leading role in arguing that Britain should stay in the EU and does not rule out seeking the leadership in the future.He said he thought he had understood ""the scrutiny and attention a leadership contest would bring"", but added: ""However, since the night of our defeat last week I have been subject to the added level of pressure that comes with being a leadership candidate.""The shadow business secretary said he had wondered if it was too soon for him to stand for the leadership, and ""I fear it was."" He also cited concerns about the impact on ""the rest of one's life"" and those close to him.""Consequently, after further reflection, I am withdrawing my candidacy,"" he said.Mr Umunna said he would continue to serve as shadow business secretary and hoped to ""play a leading role"" in Labour's campaign to keep the UK in the EU during the forthcoming in/out referendum.Commenting on the news, Labour former culture secretary Ben Bradshaw - who is expected to run for deputy leader - said Mr Umunna was a ""terrible loss"" to the field.He told the BBC's Daily Politics the Streatham MP had been the candidate the Conservative Party ""feared the most"".""And if it's the result of pressure on an extended family or an extended group of friends, I think that's a very sad reflection on our political culture,"" he said.Chuka Umunna feels ""liberated"", he told me, by his decision to quit the Labour leadership race.He hopes to be given a good role (shadow chancellor, I wonder?) by whoever becomes Labour leader. And I expect he'll become very high profile in the campaign to keep Britain in Europe, which is increasingly looking like it will be next May.He'll endorse a candidate in the next four weeks before nominations close. It will be very interesting to see who he piles in behind.Read more from Allegra (see post 13.23).Former Labour leader Lord Kinnock said he thought Mr Umunna had made the right decision.He said: ""If he felt in his soul that he wasn't prepared to subject himself - and more importantly his family - to the kind of attention which is fairly typical, sadly, these days, he has done absolutely the right thing.""There is no point at all in inflicting avoidable, unnecessary misery on those you love most.""Leadership contender Mary Creagh said she had ""huge respect"" for Mr Umunna, telling BBC Radio 4's World at One programme it took ""courage"" to withdraw from the leadership race.Mr Umunna was ""a big beast"" and would play a ""big role"" in the future of the Labour Party, she added.Yvette Cooper, Andy Burnham, Liz Kendall and Mary Creagh have already thrown their hats into the ring for Labour's top job while a number of other potential candidates, including Dan Jarvis, Alan Johnson and David Lammy, have ruled themselves out. Candidates must secure nominations from 34 colleagues - 15% of the party's MPs - by 15 June to make it on to ballot papers, which will be sent to members in August ahead of the leader's election a month later."

However, Mr Justice Stuart Smith at Southwark Crown Court said there was a ""very strong likelihood"" a custodial sentence would follow.The jury heard how Mote submitted numerous false expenses claims for payment for work that organisations had allegedly carried out on his behalf.Mote claimed the money was to pay whistleblowers in cash through third parties. He also said he had been ""targeted for being an anti-EU MEP.""During his time an MEP he also made £250,000 legitimate expenses claims.No date has been set for the sentencing."

2015-04-22,Round-up: BBC experts' analysis,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/election-2015-32650417,"The political future of the United Kingdom has become clearer after the results of the general election emerged around the country.David Cameron says he hopes to govern for all of the UK after the Conservatives took 331 seats - enough to form a slender majority in the Commons.Labour has been all but wiped out by the SNP in Scotland and suffered a disappointing set of results elsewhere, while the Lib Dems are left with just eight MPs after many party heavyweights such as Vince Cable and Danny Alexander lost their seats.So with battles won and lost and the fall-out and celebrations beginning, BBC correspondents examine the implications and challenges that lie ahead for the new government - and for those whose political careers have been ended by voters.No pollster, no pundit, no political leader saw it coming - not even David Cameron himself.Governing parties don't gain seats. Parties that have implemented painful cuts and are promising more certainly don't. Until that is the Conservative Party did - achieving what had seemed to be Mission Impossible - a Tory majority.Until that is David Cameron's personal triumph which triggered the near simultaneous resignation of his three principle opponents - Messrs Miliband, Clegg and Farage.They did so in part because they helped to crush their partners in coalition these last five years - reducing the Liberal Democrat parliamentary party to a size when it can fit into two London taxis and still have two seats to spare.In part because the extraordinary tidal wave of support for the SNP swept dozens of once safe Labour seats away.In part because Nigel Farage persuaded millions to vote for him but secured just one seat - not, though, the one he was standing in.Read more from Nick Robinson hereThe question uppermost in the prime minister's mind as he assembles his new government is how to keep the kingdom united.""Above all I want to bring our country together,"" he revealed after the result, ""to reclaim a mantle we should never have lost - the mantle of one nation, one United Kingdom"".Looking at the political landscape from Land's End today is very different to the view from John O'Groats.A sea of Conservative and Unionist blue dominates the scene across much of England, while a field of SNP nationalist yellow stretches to the horizon and beyond from the north.David Cameron's greatest challenge is to prevent the union he supports being torn apart by mutual resentment - resentment from Scotland at a Westminster government dominated by English Tories, and resentment from England at the preferential treatment people think is being given to the Scots.Those who assumed the future of the Union had been safeguarded by the Scottish referendum must think again.Read more from Mark Easton hereOne thing is rock-solid true: the Conservatives who worked on this campaign are as surprised by the result as the pollsters, pundits, politicians and general population.Maybe they shouldn't be - the economy is in good shape and the Conservatives had incumbency advantage.But when I travelled back from the prime minister's last rally with a group of exhausted Conservative campaign officials it was clear that 290 seats was a hoped-for target.No-one talked about anything over 300 seats, and no-one even mentioned an overall majority.So what special sauce pushed David Cameron into No 10 with a Commons majority?Mr Cameron had two simple messages in the campaign and he rarely veered away from them; the first - the economy is in good shape and the recovery is threatened by Labour. And the second - the SNP would hold a Labour-led government to ransom.Read more from Jonny Dymond hereBrian Taylor, BBC political editor, ScotlandOf all the comments on the overnight apocalypse, undoubtedly the most straightforward came from a defeated Scottish Labour MP.Since there were quite a few of them, let me narrow the focus a little. Come on down, Tom Harris.Mr Harris had plainly anticipated defeat. Nonetheless, he looked suitably lugubrious as his fate was confirmed.Why, he was asked eagerly, had Labour lost? ""Because we did not win enough votes.""Psephologically, it is perfect. Complete in itself. Psychologically, it sums up Labour's gloom without descending into subsidiary matters such as leadership, strategy and the rest. As a forward-thinking strategy, it is ideal. Win more votes. Simple.Read more from Brian Taylor hereThis has been an election which may have more profound consequences than almost any in living memory.We now face a generational decision about our future in Europe, with an EU referendum in two years' time almost certain.There will also be serious questions about the future of the Union, following an SNP landslide that has turned Scotland into a virtual one-party state.David Cameron's victory also represents a colossal achievement.Only once before in recent history has an incumbent government increased its majority - and that was Mrs Thatcher in her prime in the 1980s.It is also a significant personal victory for Mr Cameron and a rebuff for those in his party who had become increasingly sceptical about his ability to win.But while it may represent a defeat for those Tories who saw this election as a potential opportunity to rid themselves of David Cameron, he must now govern with a wafer-thin majority.For the SNP, their stunning victory can only increase the pressure on Nicola Sturgeon to include a commitment to a second independence referendum in her party's manifesto for next year's Scottish elections.It is an election which has not just defied all the predictions of the pollsters and pundits - but which may yet prompt the most fundamental re-casting of British politics for a generation.Read more from Norman Smith hereAfter an extraordinary night, some brief conclusions:Read more from James Landale hereIs this the end of the union?That is the question many people will be asking this morning after the party which has fought for Scottish independence for 80 years swept to victory.The answer from the jubilant Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon is a firm ""No"".She insists that her MPs will speak for all of Scotland, not just for the 45% who voted for the country to leave the United Kingdom last September.In the closing hours of the most extraordinary election campaign which anyone in Scotland can remember, Ms Sturgeon turned to talk of ""legitimacy.""That will be her watchword in the coming days as she argues that the prime minister cannot ignore the democratic will of the Scottish people.Politically, Scotland and England this morning look and feel like very different countries.Read more from James Cook hereAfter weeks of chatter about an election too close to call, it wasn't that close at all.David Cameron will be continuing as our prime minister.So, what is all this likely to mean?A referendum on whether the UK stays in, or leaves, the European Union, within the next two-and-a-half years.A race to be the next leader of the Labour Party.A race to be the next leader of the Liberal Democrats.And a huge new presence of Scottish National Party MPs at Westminster.And so here's another thing we know for certain this morning: Politics ain't going to be boring any time soon.Read more from Chris Mason hereFor Labour the story of their terrible night is rapidly turning into the search for a new leader. So who will that be?Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, is almost certain to run.  Even before this election, both he and another almost inevitable candidate, Chuka Umunna, had raised eyebrows inside the party at the work they had put in, preparing the ground with members and the unions for potential bids.Yvette Cooper, before the election, was still thought not to have made up her mind over whether to run. That decision has been made perhaps a little easier as her husband, Ed Balls, has lost his seat.She is certainly potentially in the frame, along with two lesser known names - Liz Kendall and Dan Jarvis - two MPs who were only elected in 2010 for the first time. This could be their moment. But whoever is in the job, they face a monumental task.Read Laura Kuenssberg's Twitter hereSterling is up (the most for seven years against the euro), share prices are up (especially bank shares like Lloyds and RBS, and energy shares such as Centrica), government bond prices are up.To state the obvious, investors love the Tories' general election victory.There are a few reasons.One (no surprise here) is that Labour's threat of breaking up banks and imposing energy price caps has been lifted.Second is that investors have been discounting days and weeks of wrangling after polling day over who would form the government - and so they are semi-euphoric that we already know who's in charge.Third, many investors tend to be economically conservative and instinctively Conservative.But although the City may be a bit drunk on the result, its pleasure in Ed Miliband's and Ed Balls' humiliation may be making it a bit blind - perhaps dangerously so - to some bumps in the economic road ahead.Read more from Robert Peston hereNigel Farage dreamed of holding the balance of power, but in the end his UKIP party is now worse off than when it came into the election.At the seventh time of asking he was rejected - this time by the people of Thanet South. It was a similar story in Rochester and Strood where Mark Reckless, who sensationally defected from the Tories last year, was also sent packing.In seats on UKIP's target list, like Thurrock in Essex, the party failed to make gains. In Grimsby - where Mr Farage went twice in the last six weeks - they came third.UKIP got around four million votes - with especially strong showings in north-east and south-east England - but it's ended up with just one MP, and a vacancy at the top. This has led to UKIP attacking the current system of choosing MPs, which it's described as ""busted"" and ""dysfunctional"".In one sense, this campaign was a complete failure and it's left an aftermath of angry voters, and others wondering if the UKIP bubble has burst.Read Robin Brant's Twitter hereI monitored 91 GB-wide voting intention polls during the 2015 election campaign and found nothing in them to prepare me for the final outcome.The good news for the pollsters was that their share for the Lib Dems was pretty close, as were the shares for UKIP, the Greens and the catch-all category of Others.The bad news for the polling industry was that the crucial shares for Conservative and Labour were the ones where they came most adrift.When all the qualifications of margins of error are allowed, there did appear to be a systematic overstatement of the Labour share and an equally systematic understatement of the Conservative one.It is for the pollsters to decide whether to conduct a review of their performance but I trust they will avoid the initial knee-jerk reaction of the immediate aftermath of the 1992 polls debacle.This general election performance follows the performance of the polls in the 2014 Scottish referendum where the choice was simply binary and yet all the polls were out by between 4-6%.Something is wrong. A lot of us would like to know what it is.Read more from David Cowling hereThe words ""political earthquake"" have been translated into numerous European languages, making front page news across the continent.While Britons now examine the domestic minutiae of the election result, here in mainland Europe the vote means one thing: a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU. And that has the potential to create an earthquake of its own.The guardian of the EU treaties Mr Cameron wants to change - Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker - has said again he'd listen to what Britain's new government proposed.Read more from Katya Adler here"

2015-04-22,A history of political plots,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32749971,"Nigel Farage has apparently seen off a challenge to his leadership of UKIP - a move described by his former election strategist as a ""coup"". He's not the only party leader to face an attempted ousting. But can you recover from such a revolt?In 2006, the Labour prime minister was the target of what became known as the ""curry house conspiracy"" - a coup to remove him and install his chancellor, Gordon Brown, as prime minister.It would lead to several of the plotters' resignations - but not Mr Blair's. However, it was successful to a degree in that it forced the party leader into naming a departure date.The move against him was reportedly masterminded by Tom Watson, a defence minister at the time, who was also rumoured to have had a secret meeting with Mr Brown on the eve of the revolt.Apparently, Mr Watson and three fellow West Midlands MPs - Sion Simon, David Wright (both ministerial aides) and Khalid Mahmood - met over a biryani at a Wolverhampton curry house to discuss the PM's future, before dispatching a missive calling for him to quit.The letter - which attracted the support of a number of normally loyal Labour MPs - was leaked to the press, and ultimately resulted in Mr Watson's resignation.In his parting letter, the West Bromwich East MP took a shot at the prime minister, who he said should step down in the interests of party and country.Mr Blair denounced his actions and branded the former minister ""disloyal, discourteous and wrong"", saying he would have sacked him if he had not resigned.But Mr Watson's departure was swiftly followed by the resignations of six other junior members of government - who had also signed the rebel letter - in protest at the prime minister's refusal to say when he would step down as Labour leader.The whole affair resulted in Mr Blair announcing his intention to step aside within 12 months - which he duly did, on 27 June 2007.But it did nothing to quash internal dissent and speculation in the party over the future leadership of the party.Labour prime minister Gordon Brown found his leadership under threat in 2009 after one of his cabinet ministers dramatically quit the government and called for him to resign.Work and Pensions Secretary James Purnell - a former aide to Tony Blair - resigned from his post after the polls closed in the local and European elections, in which Labour was forecast to do badly.Explaining his decision to quit, Mr Purnell said the prime minister made a Conservative victory ""more, not less, likely"".It was Mr Brown's first direct challenge from a cabinet minister - but it would not topple the Labour leader as senior members of government refused to follow Mr Purnell's lead.Mr Brown was safe for the time being. But several months later, in January 2010, a fresh leadership challenge was mounted by two senior former Labour cabinet ministers.Geoff Hoon and Patricia Hewitt wrote to all Labour MPs, saying the party was ""deeply divided"" over Mr Brown's leadership and that the best way to resolve the issue was by way of secret ballot.They insisted it was not an ""attempted coup"" but a necessary step to resolve divisions within the party.But the duo could only muster the public support of a handful of backbenchers long-opposed to Mr Brown, with the majority of the party's MPs less than impressed by the move, which came just weeks before the general election.As the day wore on, a succession of cabinet ministers came out to back the PM, suggesting there was little momentum behind the plot - although it was noted that several were not exactly gushing in their support of Mr Brown.As history tells us, neither leadership challenge bore fruit but they reflected the internal doubts and divisions over Mr Brown at the helm.As leadership toppling attempts go, this one in 2014 was regarded as a particularly ""botched"" and ""shambolic coup"". Indeed, former Lib Dem leader Lord (Paddy) Ashdown described the move as a ""plot of deep malice"".Its instigator, Lord (Matthew) Oakeshott - a close ally of the-then Business Secretary Vince Cable - tried to unseat Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg.The peer was found to have commissioned secret polls suggesting the party would do better at the 2015 general election without Mr Clegg in the driving seat.The man Lord Oakeshott had long had in mind to take Mr Clegg's place - Mr Cable, who was on government business in China at the time - was forced to publicly condemn his friend's actions and state his backing for Mr Clegg.But Lord Oakeshott said the business secretary had in fact known about his polls and their findings.Nevertheless, the peer - who was denounced by the Lib Dem leadership for spending money that could have been spent on campaigning - quit the party, and issued a warning shot on his way out about the Lib Dems' future prospects.Mr Cable largely emerged unscathed but he faced questions about his loyalty to the leader. Although the two sought to put paid to reports of a rift with a (painfully awkward, 'nothing to see here, folks') stage-managed pint in a pub.Although the revolt failed, and Mr Clegg remained at the helm, the Lib Dems did go on to suffer a trouncing at the general election, losing nearly 50 of its MPs - one of them, Mr Cable himself - prompting his leader to quit.The Conservatives have a reputation for being more ruthless than their party rivals when it comes to getting rid of leaders they sense are no longer effectual.But, in 1995, Prime Minister John Major - tired of persistent rumours of a leadership challenge - decided to take the bull by the horns and trigger a surprise leadership election to silence his detractors.His own backbenchers had questioned Mr Major's ability to unite and lead the party, which was deeply divided over Europe.So ""put up or shut up"", he told them as he tendered his resignation as Conservative Party leader but not prime minister.But then stepped forward eurosceptic MP John Redwood, who resigned from the cabinet in order to contest Mr Major's leadership.This was unexpected by many, as the PM had said there had been assurances from his cabinet that none would stand against him.But Mr Major went on to win the ensuing election with a comfortable defeat over his challenger, who was not included in the PM's consequent cabinet reshuffle.No further contested leadership election took place until after the Conservatives' defeat at the 1997 general election, paving the way for William Hague to take over the running of the party.Not all attempts to oust a party leader end in failure: as Margaret Thatcher found out to her peril.With three electoral victories under her belt, the Conservative prime minister's downfall would come at the hands of her own party - not the voters.It was on 1 November 1990 when Geoffrey (now Lord) Howe - one of Mrs Thatcher's longest-serving ministers - resigned over differences with the party leader over Europe.In his now infamous speech on the floor of the House of Commons, he attacked the PM's policies and leadership style, comparing being one of her cabinet ministers to opening the batting at cricket only to find his bat had been ""broken... by the team captain"".It sparked the beginning of the end of the 11-year Thatcher reign.Michael (now Lord) Heseltine seized on the opportunity to challenge the prime minister in the ensuing leadership contest, from which she would eventually withdraw and John Major emerge as her successor. Reflecting on the revolt and its implications on the Conservative Party, Baroness Thatcher's biographer Charles Moore wrote: ""Because the coup was unjustified, and so trust broke down, the politics of the next 15 years were those of civil war."""
2015-04-22,Election swings and roundabouts,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-32741924,"If election manifesto claims are all about smoke and mirrors, should we now add swings and roundabouts to the political metaphor?There's an intriguing aspect to the general election results in the Midlands that puzzled me.It's the striking contrast in the swings between Labour and the Conservatives.David Cameron and his campaign strategists knew they were home and dry when Nuneaton was the first Midlands marginal to declare.It was not only a Tory hold but a swing to the Conservatives from Labour of 3%.I was in the Nottingham suburb of Beeston awaiting the result of the Broxtowe count. Would its high profile Conservative MP Anna Soubry survive a red surge?Nuneaton set the pattern. Across the Midlands, both east and west, there was a uniform swing of between three and four per cent to the Tories - Warwickshire North 3%, Amber Valley 4%, Derbyshire South 4% and Sherwood 4%. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan topped the Tory swingometer in the Midlands marginals with 5% in Loughborough.Yet in the big cities, it was a very different story. The swing went to Labour.So in Nottingham East they enjoyed a 6% swing, Nottingham South 5.8%, Leicester South 7.3%, Leicester West 5%, Birmingham Hall Green 12%, Birmingham Hodge Hill 8%.If swings to Labour on this scale had gone beyond the city ring road roundabouts and into the suburbs, Ed Miliband would have become prime minister by now.In confidence, one senior Labour insider in Nottingham told me its success in the city wards was down to organisation, experience and its teams of activists.""We won the ground war. If Nottingham's city boundaries were extended into Sherwood and Broxtowe, we would have won those constituencies as well,"" he told me.Labour leadership candidate, Leicester West's Liz Kendall has identified her party's problem beyond the ring road roundabout.It's about reaching out to Middle England.""We need to show people that we understand their aspirations and ambitions for the future,"" she told the Sunday Times.The problem for Labour was that Middle England was not interested in what the party offered…and still isn't. The Cameron brand worked its magic in those Midlands marginals... it'll take something or someone special to break up that ballot box relationship."
2015-04-22,Royal 'lobbying',https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32740154,"Prince Charles sent 27 letters to then Prime Minister Tony Blair and members of his government between September 2004 and March 2005, ""despite the Freedom of Information Act!"" as the prince joked in one.But did his suggestions and concerns have any bearing on the behaviour of Mr Blair's government?The request: Prince Charles expresses his worries over an EU directive on complementary medicines ""which is… effectively outlawing the use of certain herbal extracts"".  Mr Blair replied, offering moral support and practical help. He agreed that ""the implementation as it is currently planned is crazy"" and set out an action plan that included delaying implementation for all existing products to 2011. What happened: Herbal products were not required to be authorised until 2011, just as Mr Blair had promised. Prince Charles continues to sell his own brand of complementary products, Duchy Herbals, through Boots and Waitrose. The request: Writing to Mr Blair, the prince expresses a ""growing sense of anxiety"" that the Hill Farming Allowance, which supports farmers working on Britain's uplands, could be scrapped. In his reply, the prime minister said he understood that the Hill Farm Allowance would continue until 2007. What happened: The allowance lasted until the end of Labour's tenure in 2010, when it was abolished.The request: Just 18 months after the US-led invasion of Iraq, Prince Charles raised the issue of poor performance of Lynx helicopters in high temperatures, saying: ""I fear that this is just one more example of where our Armed Forces are being asked to do an extremely challenging job (particularly in Iraq) without the necessary resources.""Mr Blair replied: ""On the subject of the Lynx helicopter, the limitations of the existing platform, particularly in the extremely challenging environment within Iraq, are well recognised by the Ministry of Defence."" He added that replacement of the helicopters would be a priority. What happened: Mr Blair's comments go much further than what he was saying about the subject at the time. In the event, though, the fleet was not fully upgraded until 2011.The request: Prince Charles lamented that the government's TB prevention plans might not ""include a commitment to deal with the badger problem in the immediate future"" and pushed strongly for a cull, saying: ""All I can say is that I do urge you to look again at introducing a proper cull of badgers where it is necessary.""Mr Blair sympathised, saying he could ""personally see the case for culling badgers"". However, he was unwilling to commit to a cull.  What happened: Culling trials were conducted from 1998-2005. The final results, published in 2008, said that the badger cull could ""make no meaningful contribution"" to curbing bovine TB. It wasn't until 2013 that a full culling programme began in two pilot areas. These ended with the conclusion that the pilots had been neither humane nor effective at curbing the spread of TB.The request: Then Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell wrote to Prince Charles to say she had decided to give parts of the historic Smithfield meat market Grade II listed status, and was trying to persuade deputy prime minister John Prescott to ""call in"" the planning application to prevent demolition of other parts of the site. She had been swayed by evidence provided by Sir Neil Cossons, who was English Heritage chair at the time, after he had been asked by the prince to add his support. Prince Charles replied that he was ""extremely glad to read of your appreciation of the value of this group of buildings"". According to the Guardian, market workers desperate to see the redevelopment of the site invited the prince to meet them to discuss it, but his office said he was ""unlikely to accept as he did not want to interfere in the planning process"".What happened: Smithfield market is still the subject of planning battles a decade on. Successive planning applications have been refused by ministers. Last year then Communities Secretary Eric Pickles rejected plans for an office development on the site, stating that ""the extent of damage that the application would cause to the important heritage assets at Smithfield runs entirely counter to national and policy objectives intended to protect such assets from harm"".In March, the Museum of London announced a move from its current Barbican site to the Smithfield market building."
2015-04-22,Election fallout,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32703139,"""Some of those gimmicks - that tombstone, whatever idiot thought that up I do not know!""I was talking to the former Mayor of Crawley in Sussex, John Mortimer, in the town's Labour Supporters Club about the vexed question of what went wrong, and where Labour should go next. This seat is one of those southern seats Labour hoped to take, but failed.I hear a whole range of views in the club.""They didn't give nothing to depend on, they should be clear, and a little bit more down to Earth."" ""Good party, wrong leader, they don't look after business enough.""Councillor John Stanley tells me: ""I think in a way we did go too left, but now we can go a bit centre-left, or centre, depending who the new leader is.""The former mayor sums up the mood on the doorstep: ""Whatever we told them, they didn't believe us.""  Expect to hear all those views, and more, in the coming leadership contest. Step back from the angst of supporters, and it may not be that hard to see why Labour failed.  An economic recovery, hailed by independent organisations as the result of government policy, undid a party that had loudly proclaimed for five years that the coalition's policies would lead to economic disaster. Combine that with an uncharismatic and uninspirational leader, then you might argue no further debate is necessary.Fat chance of that. Defeat breeds resentment, and this one has opened up old divisions.  A chorus of Blairties, led by the man himself, has declared that Ed's problem was ignoring those with aspiration and ambition, failing to appeal to those running business. Incidentally, I've been ticked off by the perspicacious editor of the New Statesman, Jason Cowley, for using the ""unhelpful"" term ""Blairites"".I can't think of another description that fits Tony, Lord Mandelson, Lord Adonis and David Miliband quite so well. But call them what you will, the message was clear - Ed was too left wing, Labour should move back to the centre, or, if you like, to the right.Reading Mr Blair's pithy analysis, listening to Lord Mandelson's gripping and savage eloquence, describing a party sent out to shout: ""We love the poor and hate the rich,"" and so ignoring the middle, and you realise strong emotions are in play.But back to the future may not be sufficient. Of course elections are won on the centre ground. But grandees grinding axes, affronted by the failure of boys who used to make their tea, may be creating so much noise that they can't hear more insistent sounds.  For there are several elephants trumpeting loudly as they cram into the small space of the shadow cabinet room. Imagine these beasts are as gaily decorated as Berlin buddy bears. One is decked out in red, another in imperial purple bunting, and another, a mammoth, strong tusked and ice rimmed, painted yellow with tartan trimmings.Take the last first. The Scottish wipeout is Labour's biggest problem. Fail to solve it, and Labour can forget ever having a comfortable majority again. It is hard to argue Labour were wiped out in Scotland because the SNP outflanked them to the right with their appeal to the business community and the ambitious and aspirational. But it is true the SNP drew in to people from left, right and centre, just as the modernisers say Labour should. It was the politics of economic self-interest, but cast in a very different light. Tribally sneering at ""the reactionary ideology of nationalism"" as Mr Blair does, will not reach the central belt of Scotland, the middle ground of  Midlothian.What about that purple pachyderm?  In Crawley - in fact in seat after seat - there is a similar pattern.  Labour did, in fact, often increase the size of their vote. So did the Conservatives, usually by a bit more. But the real dynamic was the total collapse of the Lib Dems and the dramatic rise of UKIP. The increase in votes for Nigel Farage's party wasn't translated into parliamentary seats, but, although it is early days in terms of research, it probably hurt Labour a lot. If we believe - and I do - Matthew Goodwin and Rob Ford, authors of Revolt on the Right, these voters are often former Labour supporters - older, less educated, those left behind on the tides of  globalisation, stranded on the shores of post-industrialisation. They may have had too many disappointments to feel much ambition or aspiration. They are a challenge for Labour, and any new leader will spend a good deal of time thinking how to deal with the concerns of Europe and immigration.Whether to share their fears, or confront them will be a big decision.Which brings us to Red Nellie. Those members who still proudly call themselves socialist. This is not about Old Labour - they are more likely to be baristas or barristers than boilermakers. It is easy as an outsider, as a journalist, to treat politics as an intellectual game about how best to win power - but many people, particularly the foot soldiers, particularly after the death of  purely tribal loyalties, are in it because they passionately believe in winning  power to do something specific.Many of them are suspicious of the later incarnations of New Labour, not because it reached an accommodation with wealth and business, but because it seemed to worship at the same altar, to regard the party's core beliefs in redistribution and equality as childish fantasies from a past age.Perhaps to Mr Blair, they are the problem, people who may equate ""ambition"" with greed. They might point out that a man who claims to be worth ""only"" £20m may find it harder than most to squeeze through the eye of a needle to understand their point of view. Most successful Labour leaders will confront the left at some point, but the concerns of this group go to the existential question ""What is the party for?""This is not a polemic - not an argument about what should be done, but a reflection on the complex conundrums that will face any new Labour leader, the tearing apart of the old alliance that made up a Labour majority, and so the political need to satisfy groups with very different, indeed, contradictory demands. But looking for a Social Democratic universal theory of everything may be missing the point. What the party desperately wants is a leader who can pull the disparate threads together and articulate them as common purpose. Whether she or he exists is another matter.Much more on that in the coming months."
2015-04-22,'Take us with you',https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-32736153,"Thousands of people in the north of England have been using the hashtag ""take us with you Scotland"" to express their upset about the result of last week's general election, and Scottish nationalists are welcoming this English minority with open arms. Last Thursday's general election was a rough one for the Labour Party in its traditional stronghold in the north of England. But further to the north, the left-leaning Scottish National Party won nearly every seat it contested. That political contrast has made some left-wing voters in places like Manchester, Leeds and Sheffield look fondly on their neighbours. Since last Thursday's election in Britain the phrase ""take us with you Scotland"" has been used more than 24,000 times. ""Genuinely beginning to wonder if the North of England becoming a part of Scotland would be better for us, I really am,"" tweeted Aaron Miller from Yorkshire. Some cracked jokes under the tag after the North West Motorway Police account, which gives traffic updates, announced that they had ""picked up a pedestrian on the M62 who was trying to walk to Scotland.""After an initial spike of jokes over the weekend, the hashtag really took off when users start to mobilise in support of around a year-old petition on the campaigning site Change.org. The petition calls for the north of England to secede from the rest of the country and join up with Scotland, and more than 12,000 people have signed it.Its creator, a Sheffield resident who calls himself ""Stu Dent"", set it up to coincide with last year's Scottish independence referendum, and he also created a map imagining the boundary of a ""Scotland plus the north"" country.Stu Dent runs the Twitter account Hunters Bar, named after an area of southwest Sheffield which is very popular with - you guessed it - students. Despite the account having thousands of followers on Twitter, when the map was first posted last year, the image was shared only about 100 times - however, in the past week it's been retweeted by thousands. Stu Dent told BBC Trending that he was surprised at how popular his idea has become. ""In hindsight, perhaps I shouldn't have been,"" he said. ""There is a huge frustration in parts of the UK about the things that have happened since 2010.""""I think people need a place to go where they can say 'not in my name! This is not the England I want',"" he added. But in addition to disappointment from some quarters about the election result, there might be another reason why the petition is getting a boost now: the power of the Scottish Nationalists on Twitter. What started as a post-election joke in the North of England was quickly embraced by the so-called ""Cyber Nats"" - and a trend was born.The SNP's social media strategist Ross Colquhoun expressed the party's mood about the hashtag best, in a post which was shared more than 500 times. ""2014: #LetsStayTogether 2015: #TakeUsWithYouScotland What a difference a year makes"" he tweeted.Blog by Hannah HendersonNext story: The sport reporter and the obscene ranter who lost his jobFollow BBC Trending on Twitter @BBCtrending, and find us on Facebook."
2015-04-22,What Britain wants from Europe,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32695399,"David Cameron says he has a mandate to pursue EU reform following the Conservatives' general election victory. The PM, who will be hoping his majority government will give him extra leverage in Brussels, wants to renegotiate the terms of the UK's membership ahead of a referendum by the end of 2017. He has said he will campaign for Britain to remain in the EU if he gets the reforms he wants.Mr Cameron has said he does not want to reveal full details of his negotiating hand but he has given a broad indication, in a series of speeches and newspaper articles, of his priorities when he goes into talks with other EU leaders.These are: The prime minister has said Britain would resist any move towards a European Army and that he wants to free British police forces from EU interference. He has also ruled out Britain joining the euro.But he has placed less emphasis in recent years on demanding changes to EU social policy, such as the maximum 48-hour working week, agency workers, maternity leave and non-discrimination rules.The official UK government position is that a referendum will be held by the end of 2017 but Downing Street sources have said: ""If we can do it earlier we will.""There is speculation David Cameron is planning to hold the vote in 2016 to avoid a clash with French and German elections in 2017.The prime minister wants treaty change but even if the referendum was held in 2017 there may not be enough time to legally incorporate any reforms into a treaty and it would have to be done at a later stage.An early referendum would anger Eurosceptics who believe it would not allow enough time to make the case for exit or negotiate any meaningful concessions.""A rushed process would severely undermine the chances to secure a significant deal that both British business and voters could support and would waste the opportunity of a lifetime,"" Matthew Elliott, chief executive of Business for Britain told Breitbart London.The question is always crucial in any referendum and there is already a debate about what it should be. The Draft European Union (Referendum) Bill, published by the Conservatives in 2013, proposed this form of words: ""Do you think that the United Kingdom should remain a member of the European Union?""Some thought that leaned too far towards the status quo, encouraging a yes vote, and the Electoral Commission said it was not clear and direct enough. The watchdog proposed this form of words instead: ""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union?""The new Conservative government will attempt to repeal the Human Rights Act, which requires UK courts to treat the European Court of Human Rights as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. The European Court of Human Rights is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe (CoE), which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine.The freedom for people to move around Europe, enshrined in the EU treaties, works in parallel with the other three basic freedoms in the single market: freedom of goods, capital and services.It is likely to be a ""red line"" for other EU leaders, who do not want to see it eroded.Mr Cameron has steered clear of tackling it directly - for example by asking for an emergency ""brake"" on free movement, or a cap on numbers - focusing instead on reducing the incentive provided by welfare payments. In a speech last November, David Cameron set out measures to reduce the number of EU nationals moving to the UK.His main proposals were:Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission, has said he is ready to work with Mr Cameron to ""strike a fair deal for the United Kingdom in the EU"". The leaders of other EU nations have previously warned they are unlikely to support major changes to EU treaties to accommodate British demands. But Mr Cameron's general election victory may have given him extra leverage. ""The ball is very much in the court of the UK now,"" a senior EU official told The Guardian. ""It's up to the British to define what they want."" The key figure will be German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is very keen to keep Britain in the EU but has so far been unwilling to make major concessions to enable that to happen. There are fears that a ""pick and mix"" approach to EU treaties would undermine EU cohesion.Mr Cameron has said there is ""no doubt"" his planned reforms will require changes to the treaties governing the European Union. But this would require the unanimous support of all EU members, and may not be possible within the deadline he has set of a referendum before the end of 2017. Any attempt to change EU laws on free movement would meet fierce resistance from some EU nations, particularly Eastern European states. Mr Juncker has said free movement is non-negotiable.Mr Cameron may find it difficult to get unanimous support for his proposals for a four-year waiting period for migrant workers claiming UK benefits. East European EU members would be likely to oppose this, on the grounds that it would discriminate against their citizens.  Attempts to secure opt-outs for the City are unlikely to go down well with other European leaders.However, there are precedents for EU treaty changes to accommodate some countries' specific concerns - for example, the protocol attached to the Lisbon Treaty for Ireland.Mr Cameron has faced repeated calls to say whether he would campaign for Britain's exit from the EU in the referendum if he fails to get what he wants from the renegotiation process. All he has said is that he will ""rule nothing out"". Some Conservative MPs want Britain to leave the EU no matter what David Cameron manages to renegotiate. A larger group are likely to want more concessions than Mr Cameron has so far indicated he is prepared to demand.Senior backbencher David Davis, who was defeated by Mr Cameron for the Tory leadership in 2005, told the Daily Telegraph the majority of the 332 Conservative MPs want Mr Cameron to negotiate an ""opt-out"" power to stop individual EU laws from applying to Britain. The prime minister has said this would be ""impossible"" without Britain leaving the EU.Mr Davis claims as many as 60 Tory MPs would be prepared to rebel and vote for Britain's exit from the EU if the prime minister fails to deliver.Graham Brady, chairman of the Tory backbench 1922 committee, which represents backbenchers, has urged David Cameron to give all Conservative MPs, including ministers, a free vote in the EU referendum.In January, Mr Cameron warned that serving cabinet ministers would have to quit the government if they wanted to campaign to leave the EU if he had secured the reforms to it he wants.In the 1975 referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Economic Community, as the EU was then called, Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson decided to suspend collective responsibility because his cabinet was split on the issue. Ministers were allowed to vote with their consciences and campaign against each other. The majority of them, including Mr Wilson, joined the Yes camp, but left-wingers, such as Tony Benn, played a leading role in the No campaign. The Yes campaign won easily with 67% of the vote."

2015-04-23,Scots Labour leader Murphy to resign,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32760196,"Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy is to resign next month, he has announced.It comes despite Mr Murphy narrowly surviving a vote of no confidence at a meeting of the party's national executive in Glasgow. Mr Murphy said he would tender his resignation alongside a plan to reform the party.He lost his seat in last week's general election as the SNP won 56 of the 59 Scottish seats, leaving Labour with a single MP in Scotland.Mr Murphy said he wanted to have a successor as leader in place by the summer, and confirmed he would not be standing for a seat at the Scottish Parliament in next year's election. Instead, he said it was time to ""do something else"" and that he believed the party would continue to be divided if he remained as leader. His deputy, Kezia Dugdale MSP, will become acting leader until a permanent successor is found. Mr Murphy had faced calls to resign from several MSPs, trade unions and former MPs in the wake of his party's near wipeout at the general election.He insisted he had decided to stand down ahead of the national executive voting by 17-14 in favour of him staying in the job.Speaking at a media conference after the national executive meeting, he said: ""It is clear that a small minority who didn't accept my election as leader of the Scottish Labour Party just five months ago won't accept the vote of the executive today and that will continue to divide the party.""Today I received more support in the executive vote than I did from members of the executive when I stood for election five months ago.""He said it would be up to the executive whether to accept the reforms he would be proposing before he left the post. But he warned: ""A party in such urgent need of reform blocks those changes at its peril.""The former East Renfrewshire MP said Labour had been crushed between ""two nationalisms"" in Scotland and England.Mr Murphy said he left no legacy of bitterness for anyone in the Labour Party, and the only person he was angry at was the person who blamed Scottish Labour for the party's UK-wide general election defeat - a reference to Unite leader Len McCluskey.And he said that in many ways Scottish Labour was the ""least modernised part of the Labour movement"" and that he wanted his successor to be elected under a one member, one vote system.Mr Murphy added: ""The Labour Party's problem is not the link with trade unions, or even the relationship with Unite members - far from it. It is the destructive behaviour of one high profile trade unionist.""The leader of the Scottish Labour Party doesn't serve at the grace of Len McCluskey, and the next leader of the UK Labour Party should not be picked by Len McCluskey.""Mr McCluskey has been a vocal critic of Mr Murphy's leadership and opposed his appointment in December when Mr Murphy won the contest to replace Johann Lamont.Jim Murphy laughed and joked with Scottish Labour's sole MP as he made his way down the hotel corridor to announce his resignation.He certainly brought energy and dynamism to his election campaign - but all that achieved was Ian Murray in Edinburgh South.So as Mr Murphy bows out, who could replace him?The deputy leader Kezia Dugdale may want to step up or Neil Findlay could try again after challenging last time. Maybe the party's finance spokeswoman Jackie Baillie thinks her steady hand could steer the ship.Jenny Marra is also often talked about as future face of the party.Whoever steps into Jim Murphy's red shoes he or she will have to face a difficult 2016 Holyrood election, to put it mildly.There are also more fundamental questions about how the party can possibly move on as it faces a surging SNP.Mr Murphy was very much a creature of ""New Labour"" - but to today's generation that's old Labour.Party members may start looking for someone with no links to the past, neither a Brownite nor a Blairite. A 'cleanskin' - as the politicos put it - may well help re-connect with voters.That's a long way from now though - even some of the party's opponents may view this latest train wreck with a modicum of sympathy. Ms Lamont had resigned after claiming Scottish Labour was treated like a ""branch office"" by the London-based party leadership.Mr Murphy concluded his speech by saying: ""Scotland needs a strong Labour party; Scotland needs a united Labour party. We have been the greatest force for change in our nation's remarkable history. ""The Scottish Labour party will rise again. It will be under someone else's leadership and I am confident about my party's future.""Harriet Harman MP, acting leader of the UK Labour Party, said it would be for Scottish Labour to choose a new leader. She added: ""As a cabinet minister and leader of his party in Scotland, Jim has been a hugely important figure in the Labour Party. He leaves with the best wishes and thanks of our movement.""Labour peer Lord McConnell, a former Scottish first minister, said the party's problems were ""much deeper than one individual and one affiliate"".He said: ""We have a disconnect locally and nationally with wider Scottish society. ""We have a problem with our political positioning in the post devolution age where the party particularly at the UK level has never been comfortable with success in the Scottish parliament and has always tried to see things through a UK prism rather than a Scottish prism.""We need to find a new generation, a new leader, new generation, new ideas, a fresh approach.""In a tweet, Scottish first minister and SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said: ""I wish Jim Murphy all the very best for the future. Leadership is not easy and he deserves credit for standing up for what he believes in.""Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson also reacted on Twitter, saying: ""Jim Murphy announces a managed exit in order to help the party, which is to his credit.

2015-04-23,Labour contenders clash on spending,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32761561,"Prospective Labour leaders have clashed over Labour's record in government in their first public debate in the race to succeed Ed Miliband.Former cabinet ministers including Yvette Cooper and Andy Burnham defended Labour's fiscal record and spending on schools and hospitals.However, candidates from the 2010 intake of MPs argued that the party spent too much while in office.The debate followed Chuka Umunna's withdrawal from the leadership contest.The remaining candidates appeared at the annual conference of the Progress think tank in London.There was agreement that Labour needed to demonstrate economic credibility to regain power, with shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt telling the meeting that the party needed to be ""trusted with public finances and the family finances"".Mr Hunt, who was first elected to Parliament in 2010 when Labour lost power, argued the last Labour government ""spent too much"" and failed to ""leave enough economic headroom to deal with the economic crisis and the recession"".Shadow health minister Liz Kendall said: ""There's absolutely nothing progressive about spending more on debt interest payments than on educating our children.""But shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: ""The Tories have had a triumph of spin over the facts in saying what they said about the economic record of the last Labour government.""The former chief secretary to the Treasury said the deficit did ""grow too large"" in the government's later years but insisted: ""The last Labour government ran more surpluses in its first term than the Tories did in 18 years.""Yvette Cooper, another former chief secretary to the Treasury, said: ""We should never let anybody tell us that it was too many teachers, doctors or nurses that caused Lehman Brothers bank in New York to crash.""Shadow international development secretary Mary Creagh said: ""People have forgotten the economic credibility that the last Labour government had.""She said Labour had built schools and hospitals that were ""treasured in our communities"".Ms Cooper, Mr Burnham, Ms Kendall and Ms Creagh have declared their intention to run for leader, while Mr Hunt told the conference he would make an announcement next week.At the same event, shadow energy secretary Caroline Flint announced she would be running for deputy leader.The Don Valley MP told the Today programme ahead of the debate that Labour lost the election because ""fundamentally the public did not trust us on the economy"".Exeter MP Ben Bradshaw has already announced a bid to be deputy, saying Labour ""must and could win the next election"", but only if it ""broadens its appeal by adopting sensible, centre-left politics which celebrate wealth creation and entrepreneurship"".Former Labour campaign co-ordinator Tom Watson is reported to be crowd-funding a deputy leadership bid, while Walthamstow MP Stella Creasy has said she is ""open to the question"" of running.Barnsley East MP and shadow transport secretary Michael Dugher - a fierce critic of Ed Miliband's election campaign - is to run Mr Burnham's campaign, according to the website LabourList.It is reported that Mr Burnham also has the backing of Labour peer Lord Falconer, who was lord chancellor and justice secretary under Tony Blair and was close to the former PM.Shadow culture secretary Chris Bryant has signalled his backing for Ms Cooper, tweeting that the next leader must be ""someone who's been tried in the fiery furnace of public opinion"".Mr Hunt said on Friday he would be be attending the debate - along with the other four hopefuls - to ""set out my analysis on how we begin to understand what went so wrong and why"".He added: ""We must use this leadership election to ask some very profound questions.""All voices in the party must be heard so that we can have a full and proper assessment as to why the politics of nationalism triumphed in Scotland and huge swathes of England, and how we have allowed the Conservative Party to present a more compelling vision for Britain to so many millions of people.""Speculation still surrounds shadow business secretary Mr Umunna's decision to pull out on Friday, when he said he was not ""comfortable"" with the ""pressure"" of being a candidate.As well as citing extensive pressure and scrutiny Mr Umunna also said he was ruling himself out because of concerns about the impact of the bid on his family.A rising star of the party, Mr Umunna was first elected to Parliament in 2010 - alongside Tristram Hunt and Liz Kendall - before joining the shadow cabinet.Asked about the candidate who might win, Conservative Chancellor George Osborne said: ""The Labour leadership contest has descended into farce.""But it's not actually about personalities. I don't think the Labour Party any more represents the working people of this country who aspire to a better life."""

I'm not suggesting he takes a break from being leader.""Clearly the national executive has the authority, they're the ruling body. ""I'm told that they made a decision. I'm told it was a procedurally correct decision, he is the leader but I think it's important that as leader he takes a break and I think it's important that we work out how these complex questions are answered by a team.""No one person has all the answers. I'm particularly concerned about tone, making sure we get a tone that ensures that the 27 million people who didn't vote for UKIP last week may be persuaded to vote for us in future.""The party has been beset by wrangling since Mr Farage agreed to stay on as leader, days after standing down after failing to get elected in Thanet South.He had pledged before the general election that he would quit the post if he failed to get elected to Parliament.Senior aide Matthew Richardson has left the party, following claims from MEP Patrick O'Flynn that Mr Farage had fallen under the influence of ""inexperienced"" advisers.UKIP has also confirmed the departure of Mr Farage's chief of staff Raheem Kassam.Mr Farage ruled out quitting as leader on BBC's Question Time on Thursday, saying he had ""phenomenal"" support, and has challenged his critics to decide whether they want to stay in the party.In his article, Mr Carswell had said that ""knowing how difficult it is to lead a party makes me admire Nigel Farage all the more"".""I know that I never could,"" he added, stressing that he would find it ""impossible to simultaneously lead UKIP, be the voice of the party in the Commons, represent my Clacton constituents and at the same time be a husband and a dad"".However, he said that ""even leaders need to take a break"", adding: ""Nigel needs to take a break now.""UKIP got nearly four million votes at the election, but returned only one MP - former Conservative Mr Carswell in the Clacton constituency."

Under the plans, ministers could force schools rated as ""requiring improvement"" and missing new government benchmarks to become an academy.Coasting schools have average results which have often flatlined over time.Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, Mrs Morgan said faster action was needed.She said: ""Our big priorities will be to speed up the process for tackling failing schools; extend our academies programme to tackle 'coasting' schools; and deliver on our commitment to open new free schools.""The proposals will be in a new bill due to be introduced in the Queen's Speech. ""First, we will take new powers to step in from the moment that a school is found to be failing,"" Mrs Morgan said.""From day one, regional schools commissioners will be able to bring in new leadership and support from other excellent schools and heads, and we will speed up the process of turning schools into academies to make sure that new expert leadership is found for all schools that need it as quickly as possible.""She said that coasting schools will be put on an immediate notice to improve and could then be taken over and turned into an academy.They will be required to work with a team of ""expert"" head teachers.She said: ""Those that aren't able to demonstrate a clear plan for improvement will be given new leadership - we know this works in turning schools around.""More than 3,300 schools in England are labelled ""requires improvement"", but the plans are unlikely to cover that many schools.Under the current system, secondary schools are considered to be failing, and therefore eligible for intervention, if fewer than 40% of their students score at least five Cs at GCSE, including English and maths, and they do not meet national averages in pupil progress.In primary schools, the threshold for intervention is if fewer than 65% of pupils get Level 4 in reading, writing and maths and a below average number of pupils make the expected amount of progress.It is not yet clear how coasting schools will be deemed in need of intervention.It is understood that a new category will be devised covering schools which are rated as ""requires improvement"" and which fail to meet a new set of standards on improvement."
2015-04-23,Co-op Group to keep political funding,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-32762858,"The Co-operative Group has decided to continue financially supporting the Co-operative Party, which has strong ties to Labour.Members of the group, the UK's biggest mutual organisation, voted on the issue at their annual general meeting.They passed a motion by 48,579 for, to 39,479 against, to approve ""political expenditures"" of up to £1m which support the movement's objectives.Last year the Co-op Group gave £625,000 to the Co-op Party.This figure was down on the sums donated in previous years. The AGM also included a vote on new corporate governance procedures which would mean members having less of a direct say.The Co-operative Group is still recovering from a period of financial mismanagement and some members have recently expressed concerns about how elections to the board are chosen.The banking arm of the group came close to collapse in 2013, bringing the whole group to a £2.5bn annual loss that year. The Co-op Party includes among its members a number of Labour MPs, including shadow chancellor Chris Leslie and Walthamstow MP Stella Creasy. The politicians stand as candidates of both the Co-operative Party and the Labour Party, and the two political movements have strong historical ties. The board asked the members of the Co-operative Group whether they wanted to continue financially supporting the Co-operative Party, or any other party. Allan Leighton, chairman of the Co-op Group, said: ""There's a clear remit from the members to continue to support the Labour Party.""It allows us to now have a conversation with the Co-op Labour Party about what we do next.""There was also a members' motion on the agenda, put forward by those in favour of making political donations of up to £1m a year.The motion to approve political funding ""not to exceed £1m per annum"" was carried by 55.17% to 44.83%.BBC business correspondent Joe Lynam said: ""To meet a £1.5bn hole in its accounts - mostly stemming from its banking division - the Co-op Group has had to sell off parts of its businesses and hand over majority control of its bank to American hedge funds.""It's also in the process of radically changing the way it runs itself into a more corporate structure with less of a direct say by its members.""He said that ""in theory"", each of the 2.8 million Co-op members could vote on a series of motions about the reforms, as well as how its bosses are paid, and retaining the links to the Co-operative party.One of the group's largest independent societies, Midcounties, recently threatened legal action over a shortlist of six candidates for the group's board being reduced to three - the number of positions available - before a member vote.

""We'll crack down hard on tax avoidance and aggressive tax planning by the rich - because everyone should pay their fair share.  ""We will always protect the most vulnerable, but we also need a welfare system that's fair to the people who pay for it. If you can work you should be working, so we'll take the next steps in our benefit reforms to make sure that happens.""Second, we've got to go on helping businesses create jobs in Britain, so we move towards full employment. That means facing a hard truth: in Britain we produce about a quarter less for every hour we work than countries like America or Germany. Fixing that long-running productivity weakness is the big challenge for the next five years.""So in the Budget we'll spend less on welfare, and instead invest to create three million more apprenticeships, so that young people can learn a trade, get better jobs and earn more.""After the Budget in March independent forecaster the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said that Mr Osborne needed to spell out exactly how he plans to cut £12bn from welfare spending.Of those £12bn planned cuts, £2bn were outlined ahead of the general election - all the cuts are supposed to be in place by 2017-18.Labour's shadow energy and climate change secretary, Caroline Flint, accused the Tories of making ""a number of uncosted promises"" during the election campaign.She told the BBC: ""It will be interesting to see who is going to pay for those uncosted policies when they bring the Budget in July."""

If it isn't, stop it and do something else.""He also criticised Mr Farage's comments about HIV patients during the TV leaders' debate last month.While debating about the NHS, Mr Farage said: ""You can come into Britain from anywhere in the world and get diagnosed with HIV and get the retro-viral drugs that cost up to £25,000 per year per patient.""Mr Carswell wrote: ""By all means we should highlight the problem of health tourism. But we need to admit that using the example of HIV patients to make the point was ill-advised.""He said the party needed to strike ""the right tone"" and added: ""UKIP has been at its most persuasive when we have been most optimistic.""Anger is never a great way to motivate people - at least not for very long.""The party has been beset by wrangling since Mr Farage agreed to stay on as leader, days after standing down after failing to get elected in Thanet South.He had pledged before the general election that he would quit the post if he failed to get elected to Parliament.Matthew Richardson has left the party, following claims from MEP Patrick O'Flynn that Mr Farage had fallen under the influence of ""inexperienced"" advisers.

They absolutely loved how he helped them and he was a highly-regarded local MP,"" Mr Bone said.""He stood up for what was right rather than what the party line was. In those days - the John Major years - it was much more difficult to stand up against the party machine. He had strong views on Europe.""Sir Peter started his career as an insurance broker, joining the Wycombe Young Conservatives in 1949 and the Oxford University Conservative Association in 1951.He went on to become a Conservative councillor on Buckinghamshire County Council between 1961 and 1967.Wellingborough mayor-elect Barry Graves also paid tribute to Sir Peter, remembering him as a ""very strong constituency MP"".""I remember going out and canvassing with him and he would go everywhere. He knew the area and the people. He was very much a man of the local constituency.""He was ""a very approachable man"", Mr Graves added.Sir Peter was knighted in 1994. "

The Smith proposals included giving Holyrood the power to set income tax rates and bands, as well as control over a share of VAT and some welfare benefits. But Ms Sturgeon's SNP also wants the Scottish Parliament to be given powers over business taxes, employment law, the minimum wage and additional powers over welfare.Speaking after meeting Ms Sturgeon, Mr Cameron told the BBC: ""Let's make sure Smith is implemented in full. I'm going to keep the commitment I made to the people of Scotland. Let's get that done first because it does create a really strong Scottish Parliament.""He added: ""Of course, if people want to make future proposals I'll look at them.""The prime minister again said he did not support full fiscal autonomy for Scotland - the responsibility for all areas of tax and spending except defence and foreign affairs - stating that it would mean £7bn of cuts or extra tax-raising.What Nicola Sturgeon is trying to say is she has a mandate. She has 56 out of the 59 MPs elected in Scotland and she won 50% of the vote - unprecedented here in Scotland.She says that gives her leverage to push David Cameron. David Cameron says he wants to keep the nation together.The language coming out of Westminster last week was very much a cordial one. 'We will listen'.Nicola Sturgeon has warned him that if he doesn't listen, then the people of Scotland will judge him accordingly.Ms  Sturgeon described the hour-long talks at her official residence at Bute House as ""constructive and business-like"". She said Mr Cameron had made a ""commitment"" that the Smith proposals would be implemented ""as agreed"".""But secondly the prime minister agreed that he would look at proposals that we would now send to suggest the areas we can go beyond Smith,"" Ms Sturgeon said.""There was no agreement in terms of the substance of that but we will submit those proposals, the prime minister has said they will consider them and there will be a meeting to look at how we take that further forward.""Referring to her party's success in last week's general election, which saw the SNP win 56 out of 59 Scottish seats, Ms Sturgeon said: ""People in Scotland have now voted fairly convincingly for the SNP and sent a message that we want the Smith Commission proposals to go further and be built on.""The ball is in his court but I'm going into this in good faith.""She added: ""David Cameron and I are a world apart politically but, where we can, I'm determined to do business in the interests of the people of Scotland and across the UK.""She said she would have a ""constructive and business-like"" relationship with the prime minister. The two leaders shook hands on the front steps of Bute House as Mr Cameron arrived. Mr Cameron left the building shortly before 11:00, almost an hour after he had arrived.The two sides agreed to hold more regular discussions in the future, possibly quarterly. "

I'm human, the rest of my life is more important to me than politics.""The shadow business secretary has been distressed by the degree of scrutiny he, his family and his girlfriend have come under since he declared his intention to stand for the labour leadership.I am told that this includes reporters waiting outside the houses of relatives late at night.Friends of Mr Umunna deny that he is nervous of not getting the support of enough MPs to run for the leadership; they point out that he already has half the necessary names and that there are some weeks to go.The shadow business secretary now wants to play a leading role in arguing that Britain should stay in the EU and does not rule out seeking the leadership in the future.He said he thought he had understood ""the scrutiny and attention a leadership contest would bring"", but added: ""However, since the night of our defeat last week I have been subject to the added level of pressure that comes with being a leadership candidate.""The shadow business secretary said he had wondered if it was too soon for him to stand for the leadership, and ""I fear it was."" He also cited concerns about the impact on ""the rest of one's life"" and those close to him.""Consequently, after further reflection, I am withdrawing my candidacy,"" he said.Mr Umunna said he would continue to serve as shadow business secretary and hoped to ""play a leading role"" in Labour's campaign to keep the UK in the EU during the forthcoming in/out referendum.Commenting on the news, Labour former culture secretary Ben Bradshaw - who is expected to run for deputy leader - said Mr Umunna was a ""terrible loss"" to the field.He told the BBC's Daily Politics the Streatham MP had been the candidate the Conservative Party ""feared the most"".""And if it's the result of pressure on an extended family or an extended group of friends, I think that's a very sad reflection on our political culture,"" he said.Chuka Umunna feels ""liberated"", he told me, by his decision to quit the Labour leadership race.He hopes to be given a good role (shadow chancellor, I wonder?) by whoever becomes Labour leader. And I expect he'll become very high profile in the campaign to keep Britain in Europe, which is increasingly looking like it will be next May.He'll endorse a candidate in the next four weeks before nominations close. It will be very interesting to see who he piles in behind.Read more from Allegra (see post 13.23).Former Labour leader Lord Kinnock said he thought Mr Umunna had made the right decision.He said: ""If he felt in his soul that he wasn't prepared to subject himself - and more importantly his family - to the kind of attention which is fairly typical, sadly, these days, he has done absolutely the right thing.""There is no point at all in inflicting avoidable, unnecessary misery on those you love most.""Leadership contender Mary Creagh said she had ""huge respect"" for Mr Umunna, telling BBC Radio 4's World at One programme it took ""courage"" to withdraw from the leadership race.Mr Umunna was ""a big beast"" and would play a ""big role"" in the future of the Labour Party, she added.Yvette Cooper, Andy Burnham, Liz Kendall and Mary Creagh have already thrown their hats into the ring for Labour's top job while a number of other potential candidates, including Dan Jarvis, Alan Johnson and David Lammy, have ruled themselves out. Candidates must secure nominations from 34 colleagues - 15% of the party's MPs - by 15 June to make it on to ballot papers, which will be sent to members in August ahead of the leader's election a month later."

However, Mr Justice Stuart Smith at Southwark Crown Court said there was a ""very strong likelihood"" a custodial sentence would follow.The jury heard how Mote submitted numerous false expenses claims for payment for work that organisations had allegedly carried out on his behalf.Mote claimed the money was to pay whistleblowers in cash through third parties. He also said he had been ""targeted for being an anti-EU MEP.""During his time an MEP he also made £250,000 legitimate expenses claims.No date has been set for the sentencing."

Until that is the Conservative Party did - achieving what had seemed to be Mission Impossible - a Tory majority.Until that is David Cameron's personal triumph which triggered the near simultaneous resignation of his three principal opponents - Messrs Miliband, Clegg and Farage.   They did so in part because they helped to crush their partners in coalition these last five years - reducing the Liberal Democrat parliamentary party to a size when it can fit into two London taxis and still have two seats to spare. In part because the extraordinary tidal wave of support for the SNP swept dozens of once safe Labour seats away.In part because Nigel Farage persuaded millions to vote for him but secured just one seat - not, though, the one he was standing in.But - and this is critical - because Labour performed worse overall than it had under Gordon Brown in the immediate aftermath of the worst financial crisis of modern times.

2015-04-23,Round-up: BBC experts' analysis,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/election-2015-32650417,"The political future of the United Kingdom has become clearer after the results of the general election emerged around the country.David Cameron says he hopes to govern for all of the UK after the Conservatives took 331 seats - enough to form a slender majority in the Commons.Labour has been all but wiped out by the SNP in Scotland and suffered a disappointing set of results elsewhere, while the Lib Dems are left with just eight MPs after many party heavyweights such as Vince Cable and Danny Alexander lost their seats.So with battles won and lost and the fall-out and celebrations beginning, BBC correspondents examine the implications and challenges that lie ahead for the new government - and for those whose political careers have been ended by voters.No pollster, no pundit, no political leader saw it coming - not even David Cameron himself.Governing parties don't gain seats. Parties that have implemented painful cuts and are promising more certainly don't. Until that is the Conservative Party did - achieving what had seemed to be Mission Impossible - a Tory majority.Until that is David Cameron's personal triumph which triggered the near simultaneous resignation of his three principle opponents - Messrs Miliband, Clegg and Farage.They did so in part because they helped to crush their partners in coalition these last five years - reducing the Liberal Democrat parliamentary party to a size when it can fit into two London taxis and still have two seats to spare.In part because the extraordinary tidal wave of support for the SNP swept dozens of once safe Labour seats away.In part because Nigel Farage persuaded millions to vote for him but secured just one seat - not, though, the one he was standing in.Read more from Nick Robinson hereThe question uppermost in the prime minister's mind as he assembles his new government is how to keep the kingdom united.""Above all I want to bring our country together,"" he revealed after the result, ""to reclaim a mantle we should never have lost - the mantle of one nation, one United Kingdom"".Looking at the political landscape from Land's End today is very different to the view from John O'Groats.A sea of Conservative and Unionist blue dominates the scene across much of England, while a field of SNP nationalist yellow stretches to the horizon and beyond from the north.David Cameron's greatest challenge is to prevent the union he supports being torn apart by mutual resentment - resentment from Scotland at a Westminster government dominated by English Tories, and resentment from England at the preferential treatment people think is being given to the Scots.Those who assumed the future of the Union had been safeguarded by the Scottish referendum must think again.Read more from Mark Easton hereOne thing is rock-solid true: the Conservatives who worked on this campaign are as surprised by the result as the pollsters, pundits, politicians and general population.Maybe they shouldn't be - the economy is in good shape and the Conservatives had incumbency advantage.But when I travelled back from the prime minister's last rally with a group of exhausted Conservative campaign officials it was clear that 290 seats was a hoped-for target.No-one talked about anything over 300 seats, and no-one even mentioned an overall majority.So what special sauce pushed David Cameron into No 10 with a Commons majority?Mr Cameron had two simple messages in the campaign and he rarely veered away from them; the first - the economy is in good shape and the recovery is threatened by Labour. And the second - the SNP would hold a Labour-led government to ransom.Read more from Jonny Dymond hereBrian Taylor, BBC political editor, ScotlandOf all the comments on the overnight apocalypse, undoubtedly the most straightforward came from a defeated Scottish Labour MP.Since there were quite a few of them, let me narrow the focus a little. Come on down, Tom Harris.Mr Harris had plainly anticipated defeat. Nonetheless, he looked suitably lugubrious as his fate was confirmed.Why, he was asked eagerly, had Labour lost? ""Because we did not win enough votes.""Psephologically, it is perfect. Complete in itself. Psychologically, it sums up Labour's gloom without descending into subsidiary matters such as leadership, strategy and the rest. As a forward-thinking strategy, it is ideal. Win more votes. Simple.Read more from Brian Taylor hereThis has been an election which may have more profound consequences than almost any in living memory.We now face a generational decision about our future in Europe, with an EU referendum in two years' time almost certain.There will also be serious questions about the future of the Union, following an SNP landslide that has turned Scotland into a virtual one-party state.David Cameron's victory also represents a colossal achievement.Only once before in recent history has an incumbent government increased its majority - and that was Mrs Thatcher in her prime in the 1980s.It is also a significant personal victory for Mr Cameron and a rebuff for those in his party who had become increasingly sceptical about his ability to win.But while it may represent a defeat for those Tories who saw this election as a potential opportunity to rid themselves of David Cameron, he must now govern with a wafer-thin majority.For the SNP, their stunning victory can only increase the pressure on Nicola Sturgeon to include a commitment to a second independence referendum in her party's manifesto for next year's Scottish elections.It is an election which has not just defied all the predictions of the pollsters and pundits - but which may yet prompt the most fundamental re-casting of British politics for a generation.Read more from Norman Smith hereAfter an extraordinary night, some brief conclusions:Read more from James Landale hereIs this the end of the union?That is the question many people will be asking this morning after the party which has fought for Scottish independence for 80 years swept to victory.The answer from the jubilant Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon is a firm ""No"".She insists that her MPs will speak for all of Scotland, not just for the 45% who voted for the country to leave the United Kingdom last September.In the closing hours of the most extraordinary election campaign which anyone in Scotland can remember, Ms Sturgeon turned to talk of ""legitimacy.""That will be her watchword in the coming days as she argues that the prime minister cannot ignore the democratic will of the Scottish people.Politically, Scotland and England this morning look and feel like very different countries.Read more from James Cook hereAfter weeks of chatter about an election too close to call, it wasn't that close at all.David Cameron will be continuing as our prime minister.So, what is all this likely to mean?A referendum on whether the UK stays in, or leaves, the European Union, within the next two-and-a-half years.A race to be the next leader of the Labour Party.A race to be the next leader of the Liberal Democrats.And a huge new presence of Scottish National Party MPs at Westminster.And so here's another thing we know for certain this morning: Politics ain't going to be boring any time soon.Read more from Chris Mason hereFor Labour the story of their terrible night is rapidly turning into the search for a new leader. So who will that be?Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, is almost certain to run.  Even before this election, both he and another almost inevitable candidate, Chuka Umunna, had raised eyebrows inside the party at the work they had put in, preparing the ground with members and the unions for potential bids.Yvette Cooper, before the election, was still thought not to have made up her mind over whether to run. That decision has been made perhaps a little easier as her husband, Ed Balls, has lost his seat.She is certainly potentially in the frame, along with two lesser known names - Liz Kendall and Dan Jarvis - two MPs who were only elected in 2010 for the first time. This could be their moment. But whoever is in the job, they face a monumental task.Read Laura Kuenssberg's Twitter hereSterling is up (the most for seven years against the euro), share prices are up (especially bank shares like Lloyds and RBS, and energy shares such as Centrica), government bond prices are up.To state the obvious, investors love the Tories' general election victory.There are a few reasons.One (no surprise here) is that Labour's threat of breaking up banks and imposing energy price caps has been lifted.Second is that investors have been discounting days and weeks of wrangling after polling day over who would form the government - and so they are semi-euphoric that we already know who's in charge.Third, many investors tend to be economically conservative and instinctively Conservative.But although the City may be a bit drunk on the result, its pleasure in Ed Miliband's and Ed Balls' humiliation may be making it a bit blind - perhaps dangerously so - to some bumps in the economic road ahead.Read more from Robert Peston hereNigel Farage dreamed of holding the balance of power, but in the end his UKIP party is now worse off than when it came into the election.At the seventh time of asking he was rejected - this time by the people of Thanet South. It was a similar story in Rochester and Strood where Mark Reckless, who sensationally defected from the Tories last year, was also sent packing.In seats on UKIP's target list, like Thurrock in Essex, the party failed to make gains. In Grimsby - where Mr Farage went twice in the last six weeks - they came third.UKIP got around four million votes - with especially strong showings in north-east and south-east England - but it's ended up with just one MP, and a vacancy at the top. This has led to UKIP attacking the current system of choosing MPs, which it's described as ""busted"" and ""dysfunctional"".In one sense, this campaign was a complete failure and it's left an aftermath of angry voters, and others wondering if the UKIP bubble has burst.Read Robin Brant's Twitter hereI monitored 91 GB-wide voting intention polls during the 2015 election campaign and found nothing in them to prepare me for the final outcome.The good news for the pollsters was that their share for the Lib Dems was pretty close, as were the shares for UKIP, the Greens and the catch-all category of Others.The bad news for the polling industry was that the crucial shares for Conservative and Labour were the ones where they came most adrift.When all the qualifications of margins of error are allowed, there did appear to be a systematic overstatement of the Labour share and an equally systematic understatement of the Conservative one.It is for the pollsters to decide whether to conduct a review of their performance but I trust they will avoid the initial knee-jerk reaction of the immediate aftermath of the 1992 polls debacle.This general election performance follows the performance of the polls in the 2014 Scottish referendum where the choice was simply binary and yet all the polls were out by between 4-6%.Something is wrong. A lot of us would like to know what it is.Read more from David Cowling hereThe words ""political earthquake"" have been translated into numerous European languages, making front page news across the continent.While Britons now examine the domestic minutiae of the election result, here in mainland Europe the vote means one thing: a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU. And that has the potential to create an earthquake of its own.The guardian of the EU treaties Mr Cameron wants to change - Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker - has said again he'd listen to what Britain's new government proposed.Read more from Katya Adler here"

2015-04-23,A history of political plots,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32749971,"Nigel Farage has apparently seen off a challenge to his leadership of UKIP - a move described by his former election strategist as a ""coup"". He's not the only party leader to face an attempted ousting. But can you recover from such a revolt?In 2006, the Labour prime minister was the target of what became known as the ""curry house conspiracy"" - a coup to remove him and install his chancellor, Gordon Brown, as prime minister.It would lead to several of the plotters' resignations - but not Mr Blair's. However, it was successful to a degree in that it forced the party leader into naming a departure date.The move against him was reportedly masterminded by Tom Watson, a defence minister at the time, who was also rumoured to have had a secret meeting with Mr Brown on the eve of the revolt.Apparently, Mr Watson and three fellow West Midlands MPs - Sion Simon, David Wright (both ministerial aides) and Khalid Mahmood - met over a biryani at a Wolverhampton curry house to discuss the PM's future, before dispatching a missive calling for him to quit.The letter - which attracted the support of a number of normally loyal Labour MPs - was leaked to the press, and ultimately resulted in Mr Watson's resignation.In his parting letter, the West Bromwich East MP took a shot at the prime minister, who he said should step down in the interests of party and country.Mr Blair denounced his actions and branded the former minister ""disloyal, discourteous and wrong"", saying he would have sacked him if he had not resigned.But Mr Watson's departure was swiftly followed by the resignations of six other junior members of government - who had also signed the rebel letter - in protest at the prime minister's refusal to say when he would step down as Labour leader.The whole affair resulted in Mr Blair announcing his intention to step aside within 12 months - which he duly did, on 27 June 2007.But it did nothing to quash internal dissent and speculation in the party over the future leadership of the party.Labour prime minister Gordon Brown found his leadership under threat in 2009 after one of his cabinet ministers dramatically quit the government and called for him to resign.Work and Pensions Secretary James Purnell - a former aide to Tony Blair - resigned from his post after the polls closed in the local and European elections, in which Labour was forecast to do badly.Explaining his decision to quit, Mr Purnell said the prime minister made a Conservative victory ""more, not less, likely"".It was Mr Brown's first direct challenge from a cabinet minister - but it would not topple the Labour leader as senior members of government refused to follow Mr Purnell's lead.Mr Brown was safe for the time being. But several months later, in January 2010, a fresh leadership challenge was mounted by two senior former Labour cabinet ministers.Geoff Hoon and Patricia Hewitt wrote to all Labour MPs, saying the party was ""deeply divided"" over Mr Brown's leadership and that the best way to resolve the issue was by way of secret ballot.They insisted it was not an ""attempted coup"" but a necessary step to resolve divisions within the party.But the duo could only muster the public support of a handful of backbenchers long-opposed to Mr Brown, with the majority of the party's MPs less than impressed by the move, which came just weeks before the general election.As the day wore on, a succession of cabinet ministers came out to back the PM, suggesting there was little momentum behind the plot - although it was noted that several were not exactly gushing in their support of Mr Brown.As history tells us, neither leadership challenge bore fruit but they reflected the internal doubts and divisions over Mr Brown at the helm.As leadership toppling attempts go, this one in 2014 was regarded as a particularly ""botched"" and ""shambolic coup"". Indeed, former Lib Dem leader Lord (Paddy) Ashdown described the move as a ""plot of deep malice"".Its instigator, Lord (Matthew) Oakeshott - a close ally of the-then Business Secretary Vince Cable - tried to unseat Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg.The peer was found to have commissioned secret polls suggesting the party would do better at the 2015 general election without Mr Clegg in the driving seat.The man Lord Oakeshott had long had in mind to take Mr Clegg's place - Mr Cable, who was on government business in China at the time - was forced to publicly condemn his friend's actions and state his backing for Mr Clegg.But Lord Oakeshott said the business secretary had in fact known about his polls and their findings.Nevertheless, the peer - who was denounced by the Lib Dem leadership for spending money that could have been spent on campaigning - quit the party, and issued a warning shot on his way out about the Lib Dems' future prospects.Mr Cable largely emerged unscathed but he faced questions about his loyalty to the leader. Although the two sought to put paid to reports of a rift with a (painfully awkward, 'nothing to see here, folks') stage-managed pint in a pub.Although the revolt failed, and Mr Clegg remained at the helm, the Lib Dems did go on to suffer a trouncing at the general election, losing nearly 50 of its MPs - one of them, Mr Cable himself - prompting his leader to quit.The Conservatives have a reputation for being more ruthless than their party rivals when it comes to getting rid of leaders they sense are no longer effectual.But, in 1995, Prime Minister John Major - tired of persistent rumours of a leadership challenge - decided to take the bull by the horns and trigger a surprise leadership election to silence his detractors.His own backbenchers had questioned Mr Major's ability to unite and lead the party, which was deeply divided over Europe.So ""put up or shut up"", he told them as he tendered his resignation as Conservative Party leader but not prime minister.But then stepped forward eurosceptic MP John Redwood, who resigned from the cabinet in order to contest Mr Major's leadership.This was unexpected by many, as the PM had said there had been assurances from his cabinet that none would stand against him.But Mr Major went on to win the ensuing election with a comfortable defeat over his challenger, who was not included in the PM's consequent cabinet reshuffle.No further contested leadership election took place until after the Conservatives' defeat at the 1997 general election, paving the way for William Hague to take over the running of the party.Not all attempts to oust a party leader end in failure: as Margaret Thatcher found out to her peril.With three electoral victories under her belt, the Conservative prime minister's downfall would come at the hands of her own party - not the voters.It was on 1 November 1990 when Geoffrey (now Lord) Howe - one of Mrs Thatcher's longest-serving ministers - resigned over differences with the party leader over Europe.In his now infamous speech on the floor of the House of Commons, he attacked the PM's policies and leadership style, comparing being one of her cabinet ministers to opening the batting at cricket only to find his bat had been ""broken... by the team captain"".It sparked the beginning of the end of the 11-year Thatcher reign.Michael (now Lord) Heseltine seized on the opportunity to challenge the prime minister in the ensuing leadership contest, from which she would eventually withdraw and John Major emerge as her successor. Reflecting on the revolt and its implications on the Conservative Party, Baroness Thatcher's biographer Charles Moore wrote: ""Because the coup was unjustified, and so trust broke down, the politics of the next 15 years were those of civil war."""
2015-04-23,Election swings and roundabouts,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-32741924,"If election manifesto claims are all about smoke and mirrors, should we now add swings and roundabouts to the political metaphor?There's an intriguing aspect to the general election results in the Midlands that puzzled me.It's the striking contrast in the swings between Labour and the Conservatives.David Cameron and his campaign strategists knew they were home and dry when Nuneaton was the first Midlands marginal to declare.It was not only a Tory hold but a swing to the Conservatives from Labour of 3%.I was in the Nottingham suburb of Beeston awaiting the result of the Broxtowe count. Would its high profile Conservative MP Anna Soubry survive a red surge?Nuneaton set the pattern. Across the Midlands, both east and west, there was a uniform swing of between three and four per cent to the Tories - Warwickshire North 3%, Amber Valley 4%, Derbyshire South 4% and Sherwood 4%. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan topped the Tory swingometer in the Midlands marginals with 5% in Loughborough.Yet in the big cities, it was a very different story. The swing went to Labour.So in Nottingham East they enjoyed a 6% swing, Nottingham South 5.8%, Leicester South 7.3%, Leicester West 5%, Birmingham Hall Green 12%, Birmingham Hodge Hill 8%.If swings to Labour on this scale had gone beyond the city ring road roundabouts and into the suburbs, Ed Miliband would have become prime minister by now.In confidence, one senior Labour insider in Nottingham told me its success in the city wards was down to organisation, experience and its teams of activists.""We won the ground war. If Nottingham's city boundaries were extended into Sherwood and Broxtowe, we would have won those constituencies as well,"" he told me.Labour leadership candidate, Leicester West's Liz Kendall has identified her party's problem beyond the ring road roundabout.It's about reaching out to Middle England.""We need to show people that we understand their aspirations and ambitions for the future,"" she told the Sunday Times.The problem for Labour was that Middle England was not interested in what the party offered…and still isn't. The Cameron brand worked its magic in those Midlands marginals... it'll take something or someone special to break up that ballot box relationship."
2015-04-23,Royal 'lobbying',https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32740154,"Prince Charles sent 27 letters to then Prime Minister Tony Blair and members of his government between September 2004 and March 2005, ""despite the Freedom of Information Act!"" as the prince joked in one.But did his suggestions and concerns have any bearing on the behaviour of Mr Blair's government?The request: Prince Charles expresses his worries over an EU directive on complementary medicines ""which is… effectively outlawing the use of certain herbal extracts"".  Mr Blair replied, offering moral support and practical help. He agreed that ""the implementation as it is currently planned is crazy"" and set out an action plan that included delaying implementation for all existing products to 2011. What happened: Herbal products were not required to be authorised until 2011, just as Mr Blair had promised. Prince Charles continues to sell his own brand of complementary products, Duchy Herbals, through Boots and Waitrose. The request: Writing to Mr Blair, the prince expresses a ""growing sense of anxiety"" that the Hill Farming Allowance, which supports farmers working on Britain's uplands, could be scrapped. In his reply, the prime minister said he understood that the Hill Farm Allowance would continue until 2007. What happened: The allowance lasted until the end of Labour's tenure in 2010, when it was abolished.The request: Just 18 months after the US-led invasion of Iraq, Prince Charles raised the issue of poor performance of Lynx helicopters in high temperatures, saying: ""I fear that this is just one more example of where our Armed Forces are being asked to do an extremely challenging job (particularly in Iraq) without the necessary resources.""Mr Blair replied: ""On the subject of the Lynx helicopter, the limitations of the existing platform, particularly in the extremely challenging environment within Iraq, are well recognised by the Ministry of Defence."" He added that replacement of the helicopters would be a priority. What happened: Mr Blair's comments go much further than what he was saying about the subject at the time. In the event, though, the fleet was not fully upgraded until 2011.The request: Prince Charles lamented that the government's TB prevention plans might not ""include a commitment to deal with the badger problem in the immediate future"" and pushed strongly for a cull, saying: ""All I can say is that I do urge you to look again at introducing a proper cull of badgers where it is necessary.""Mr Blair sympathised, saying he could ""personally see the case for culling badgers"". However, he was unwilling to commit to a cull.  What happened: Culling trials were conducted from 1998-2005. The final results, published in 2008, said that the badger cull could ""make no meaningful contribution"" to curbing bovine TB. It wasn't until 2013 that a full culling programme began in two pilot areas. These ended with the conclusion that the pilots had been neither humane nor effective at curbing the spread of TB.The request: Then Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell wrote to Prince Charles to say she had decided to give parts of the historic Smithfield meat market Grade II listed status, and was trying to persuade deputy prime minister John Prescott to ""call in"" the planning application to prevent demolition of other parts of the site. She had been swayed by evidence provided by Sir Neil Cossons, who was English Heritage chair at the time, after he had been asked by the prince to add his support. Prince Charles replied that he was ""extremely glad to read of your appreciation of the value of this group of buildings"". According to the Guardian, market workers desperate to see the redevelopment of the site invited the prince to meet them to discuss it, but his office said he was ""unlikely to accept as he did not want to interfere in the planning process"".What happened: Smithfield market is still the subject of planning battles a decade on. Successive planning applications have been refused by ministers. Last year then Communities Secretary Eric Pickles rejected plans for an office development on the site, stating that ""the extent of damage that the application would cause to the important heritage assets at Smithfield runs entirely counter to national and policy objectives intended to protect such assets from harm"".In March, the Museum of London announced a move from its current Barbican site to the Smithfield market building."
2015-04-23,Election fallout,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32703139,"""Some of those gimmicks - that tombstone, whatever idiot thought that up I do not know!""I was talking to the former Mayor of Crawley in Sussex, John Mortimer, in the town's Labour Supporters Club about the vexed question of what went wrong, and where Labour should go next. This seat is one of those southern seats Labour hoped to take, but failed.I hear a whole range of views in the club.""They didn't give nothing to depend on, they should be clear, and a little bit more down to Earth."" ""Good party, wrong leader, they don't look after business enough.""Councillor John Stanley tells me: ""I think in a way we did go too left, but now we can go a bit centre-left, or centre, depending who the new leader is.""The former mayor sums up the mood on the doorstep: ""Whatever we told them, they didn't believe us.""  Expect to hear all those views, and more, in the coming leadership contest. Step back from the angst of supporters, and it may not be that hard to see why Labour failed.  An economic recovery, hailed by independent organisations as the result of government policy, undid a party that had loudly proclaimed for five years that the coalition's policies would lead to economic disaster. Combine that with an uncharismatic and uninspirational leader, then you might argue no further debate is necessary.Fat chance of that. Defeat breeds resentment, and this one has opened up old divisions.  A chorus of Blairties, led by the man himself, has declared that Ed's problem was ignoring those with aspiration and ambition, failing to appeal to those running business. Incidentally, I've been ticked off by the perspicacious editor of the New Statesman, Jason Cowley, for using the ""unhelpful"" term ""Blairites"".I can't think of another description that fits Tony, Lord Mandelson, Lord Adonis and David Miliband quite so well. But call them what you will, the message was clear - Ed was too left wing, Labour should move back to the centre, or, if you like, to the right.Reading Mr Blair's pithy analysis, listening to Lord Mandelson's gripping and savage eloquence, describing a party sent out to shout: ""We love the poor and hate the rich,"" and so ignoring the middle, and you realise strong emotions are in play.But back to the future may not be sufficient. Of course elections are won on the centre ground. But grandees grinding axes, affronted by the failure of boys who used to make their tea, may be creating so much noise that they can't hear more insistent sounds.  For there are several elephants trumpeting loudly as they cram into the small space of the shadow cabinet room. Imagine these beasts are as gaily decorated as Berlin buddy bears. One is decked out in red, another in imperial purple bunting, and another, a mammoth, strong tusked and ice rimmed, painted yellow with tartan trimmings.Take the last first. The Scottish wipeout is Labour's biggest problem. Fail to solve it, and Labour can forget ever having a comfortable majority again. It is hard to argue Labour were wiped out in Scotland because the SNP outflanked them to the right with their appeal to the business community and the ambitious and aspirational. But it is true the SNP drew in to people from left, right and centre, just as the modernisers say Labour should. It was the politics of economic self-interest, but cast in a very different light. Tribally sneering at ""the reactionary ideology of nationalism"" as Mr Blair does, will not reach the central belt of Scotland, the middle ground of  Midlothian.What about that purple pachyderm?  In Crawley - in fact in seat after seat - there is a similar pattern.  Labour did, in fact, often increase the size of their vote. So did the Conservatives, usually by a bit more. But the real dynamic was the total collapse of the Lib Dems and the dramatic rise of UKIP. The increase in votes for Nigel Farage's party wasn't translated into parliamentary seats, but, although it is early days in terms of research, it probably hurt Labour a lot. If we believe - and I do - Matthew Goodwin and Rob Ford, authors of Revolt on the Right, these voters are often former Labour supporters - older, less educated, those left behind on the tides of  globalisation, stranded on the shores of post-industrialisation. They may have had too many disappointments to feel much ambition or aspiration. They are a challenge for Labour, and any new leader will spend a good deal of time thinking how to deal with the concerns of Europe and immigration.Whether to share their fears, or confront them will be a big decision.Which brings us to Red Nellie. Those members who still proudly call themselves socialist. This is not about Old Labour - they are more likely to be baristas or barristers than boilermakers. It is easy as an outsider, as a journalist, to treat politics as an intellectual game about how best to win power - but many people, particularly the foot soldiers, particularly after the death of  purely tribal loyalties, are in it because they passionately believe in winning  power to do something specific.Many of them are suspicious of the later incarnations of New Labour, not because it reached an accommodation with wealth and business, but because it seemed to worship at the same altar, to regard the party's core beliefs in redistribution and equality as childish fantasies from a past age.Perhaps to Mr Blair, they are the problem, people who may equate ""ambition"" with greed. They might point out that a man who claims to be worth ""only"" £20m may find it harder than most to squeeze through the eye of a needle to understand their point of view. Most successful Labour leaders will confront the left at some point, but the concerns of this group go to the existential question ""What is the party for?""This is not a polemic - not an argument about what should be done, but a reflection on the complex conundrums that will face any new Labour leader, the tearing apart of the old alliance that made up a Labour majority, and so the political need to satisfy groups with very different, indeed, contradictory demands. But looking for a Social Democratic universal theory of everything may be missing the point. What the party desperately wants is a leader who can pull the disparate threads together and articulate them as common purpose. Whether she or he exists is another matter.Much more on that in the coming months."
2015-04-23,'Take us with you',https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-32736153,"Thousands of people in the north of England have been using the hashtag ""take us with you Scotland"" to express their upset about the result of last week's general election, and Scottish nationalists are welcoming this English minority with open arms. Last Thursday's general election was a rough one for the Labour Party in its traditional stronghold in the north of England. But further to the north, the left-leaning Scottish National Party won nearly every seat it contested. That political contrast has made some left-wing voters in places like Manchester, Leeds and Sheffield look fondly on their neighbours. Since last Thursday's election in Britain the phrase ""take us with you Scotland"" has been used more than 24,000 times. ""Genuinely beginning to wonder if the North of England becoming a part of Scotland would be better for us, I really am,"" tweeted Aaron Miller from Yorkshire. Some cracked jokes under the tag after the North West Motorway Police account, which gives traffic updates, announced that they had ""picked up a pedestrian on the M62 who was trying to walk to Scotland.""After an initial spike of jokes over the weekend, the hashtag really took off when users start to mobilise in support of around a year-old petition on the campaigning site Change.org. The petition calls for the north of England to secede from the rest of the country and join up with Scotland, and more than 12,000 people have signed it.Its creator, a Sheffield resident who calls himself ""Stu Dent"", set it up to coincide with last year's Scottish independence referendum, and he also created a map imagining the boundary of a ""Scotland plus the north"" country.Stu Dent runs the Twitter account Hunters Bar, named after an area of southwest Sheffield which is very popular with - you guessed it - students. Despite the account having thousands of followers on Twitter, when the map was first posted last year, the image was shared only about 100 times - however, in the past week it's been retweeted by thousands. Stu Dent told BBC Trending that he was surprised at how popular his idea has become. ""In hindsight, perhaps I shouldn't have been,"" he said. ""There is a huge frustration in parts of the UK about the things that have happened since 2010.""""I think people need a place to go where they can say 'not in my name! This is not the England I want',"" he added. But in addition to disappointment from some quarters about the election result, there might be another reason why the petition is getting a boost now: the power of the Scottish Nationalists on Twitter. What started as a post-election joke in the North of England was quickly embraced by the so-called ""Cyber Nats"" - and a trend was born.The SNP's social media strategist Ross Colquhoun expressed the party's mood about the hashtag best, in a post which was shared more than 500 times. ""2014: #LetsStayTogether 2015: #TakeUsWithYouScotland What a difference a year makes"" he tweeted.Blog by Hannah HendersonNext story: The sport reporter and the obscene ranter who lost his jobFollow BBC Trending on Twitter @BBCtrending, and find us on Facebook."
2015-04-23,What Britain wants from Europe,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32695399,"David Cameron says he has a mandate to pursue EU reform following the Conservatives' general election victory. The PM, who will be hoping his majority government will give him extra leverage in Brussels, wants to renegotiate the terms of the UK's membership ahead of a referendum by the end of 2017. He has said he will campaign for Britain to remain in the EU if he gets the reforms he wants.Mr Cameron has said he does not want to reveal full details of his negotiating hand but he has given a broad indication, in a series of speeches and newspaper articles, of his priorities when he goes into talks with other EU leaders.These are: The prime minister has said Britain would resist any move towards a European Army and that he wants to free British police forces from EU interference. He has also ruled out Britain joining the euro.But he has placed less emphasis in recent years on demanding changes to EU social policy, such as the maximum 48-hour working week, agency workers, maternity leave and non-discrimination rules.The official UK government position is that a referendum will be held by the end of 2017 but Downing Street sources have said: ""If we can do it earlier we will.""There is speculation David Cameron is planning to hold the vote in 2016 to avoid a clash with French and German elections in 2017.The prime minister wants treaty change but even if the referendum was held in 2017 there may not be enough time to legally incorporate any reforms into a treaty and it would have to be done at a later stage.An early referendum would anger Eurosceptics who believe it would not allow enough time to make the case for exit or negotiate any meaningful concessions.""A rushed process would severely undermine the chances to secure a significant deal that both British business and voters could support and would waste the opportunity of a lifetime,"" Matthew Elliott, chief executive of Business for Britain told Breitbart London.The question is always crucial in any referendum and there is already a debate about what it should be. The Draft European Union (Referendum) Bill, published by the Conservatives in 2013, proposed this form of words: ""Do you think that the United Kingdom should remain a member of the European Union?""Some thought that leaned too far towards the status quo, encouraging a yes vote, and the Electoral Commission said it was not clear and direct enough. The watchdog proposed this form of words instead: ""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union?""The new Conservative government will attempt to repeal the Human Rights Act, which requires UK courts to treat the European Court of Human Rights as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. The European Court of Human Rights is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe (CoE), which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine.The freedom for people to move around Europe, enshrined in the EU treaties, works in parallel with the other three basic freedoms in the single market: freedom of goods, capital and services.It is likely to be a ""red line"" for other EU leaders, who do not want to see it eroded.Mr Cameron has steered clear of tackling it directly - for example by asking for an emergency ""brake"" on free movement, or a cap on numbers - focusing instead on reducing the incentive provided by welfare payments. In a speech last November, David Cameron set out measures to reduce the number of EU nationals moving to the UK.His main proposals were:Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission, has said he is ready to work with Mr Cameron to ""strike a fair deal for the United Kingdom in the EU"". The leaders of other EU nations have previously warned they are unlikely to support major changes to EU treaties to accommodate British demands. But Mr Cameron's general election victory may have given him extra leverage. ""The ball is very much in the court of the UK now,"" a senior EU official told The Guardian. ""It's up to the British to define what they want."" The key figure will be German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is very keen to keep Britain in the EU but has so far been unwilling to make major concessions to enable that to happen. There are fears that a ""pick and mix"" approach to EU treaties would undermine EU cohesion.Mr Cameron has said there is ""no doubt"" his planned reforms will require changes to the treaties governing the European Union. But this would require the unanimous support of all EU members, and may not be possible within the deadline he has set of a referendum before the end of 2017. Any attempt to change EU laws on free movement would meet fierce resistance from some EU nations, particularly Eastern European states. Mr Juncker has said free movement is non-negotiable.Mr Cameron may find it difficult to get unanimous support for his proposals for a four-year waiting period for migrant workers claiming UK benefits. East European EU members would be likely to oppose this, on the grounds that it would discriminate against their citizens.  Attempts to secure opt-outs for the City are unlikely to go down well with other European leaders.However, there are precedents for EU treaty changes to accommodate some countries' specific concerns - for example, the protocol attached to the Lisbon Treaty for Ireland.Mr Cameron has faced repeated calls to say whether he would campaign for Britain's exit from the EU in the referendum if he fails to get what he wants from the renegotiation process. All he has said is that he will ""rule nothing out"". Some Conservative MPs want Britain to leave the EU no matter what David Cameron manages to renegotiate. A larger group are likely to want more concessions than Mr Cameron has so far indicated he is prepared to demand.Senior backbencher David Davis, who was defeated by Mr Cameron for the Tory leadership in 2005, told the Daily Telegraph the majority of the 332 Conservative MPs want Mr Cameron to negotiate an ""opt-out"" power to stop individual EU laws from applying to Britain. The prime minister has said this would be ""impossible"" without Britain leaving the EU.Mr Davis claims as many as 60 Tory MPs would be prepared to rebel and vote for Britain's exit from the EU if the prime minister fails to deliver.Graham Brady, chairman of the Tory backbench 1922 committee, which represents backbenchers, has urged David Cameron to give all Conservative MPs, including ministers, a free vote in the EU referendum.In January, Mr Cameron warned that serving cabinet ministers would have to quit the government if they wanted to campaign to leave the EU if he had secured the reforms to it he wants.In the 1975 referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Economic Community, as the EU was then called, Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson decided to suspend collective responsibility because his cabinet was split on the issue. Ministers were allowed to vote with their consciences and campaign against each other. The majority of them, including Mr Wilson, joined the Yes camp, but left-wingers, such as Tony Benn, played a leading role in the No campaign. The Yes campaign won easily with 67% of the vote."

2015-04-24,Scots Labour leader Murphy to resign,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32760196,"Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy is to resign next month, he has announced.It comes despite Mr Murphy narrowly surviving a vote of no confidence at a meeting of the party's national executive in Glasgow. Mr Murphy said he would tender his resignation alongside a plan to reform the party.He lost his seat in last week's general election as the SNP won 56 of the 59 Scottish seats, leaving Labour with a single MP in Scotland.Mr Murphy said he wanted to have a successor as leader in place by the summer, and confirmed he would not be standing for a seat at the Scottish Parliament in next year's election. Instead, he said it was time to ""do something else"" and that he believed the party would continue to be divided if he remained as leader. His deputy, Kezia Dugdale MSP, will become acting leader until a permanent successor is found. Mr Murphy had faced calls to resign from several MSPs, trade unions and former MPs in the wake of his party's near wipeout at the general election.He insisted he had decided to stand down ahead of the national executive voting by 17-14 in favour of him staying in the job.Speaking at a media conference after the national executive meeting, he said: ""It is clear that a small minority who didn't accept my election as leader of the Scottish Labour Party just five months ago won't accept the vote of the executive today and that will continue to divide the party.""Today I received more support in the executive vote than I did from members of the executive when I stood for election five months ago.""He said it would be up to the executive whether to accept the reforms he would be proposing before he left the post. But he warned: ""A party in such urgent need of reform blocks those changes at its peril.""The former East Renfrewshire MP said Labour had been crushed between ""two nationalisms"" in Scotland and England.Mr Murphy said he left no legacy of bitterness for anyone in the Labour Party, and the only person he was angry at was the person who blamed Scottish Labour for the party's UK-wide general election defeat - a reference to Unite leader Len McCluskey.And he said that in many ways Scottish Labour was the ""least modernised part of the Labour movement"" and that he wanted his successor to be elected under a one member, one vote system.Mr Murphy added: ""The Labour Party's problem is not the link with trade unions, or even the relationship with Unite members - far from it. It is the destructive behaviour of one high profile trade unionist.""The leader of the Scottish Labour Party doesn't serve at the grace of Len McCluskey, and the next leader of the UK Labour Party should not be picked by Len McCluskey.""Mr McCluskey has been a vocal critic of Mr Murphy's leadership and opposed his appointment in December when Mr Murphy won the contest to replace Johann Lamont.Jim Murphy laughed and joked with Scottish Labour's sole MP as he made his way down the hotel corridor to announce his resignation.He certainly brought energy and dynamism to his election campaign - but all that achieved was Ian Murray in Edinburgh South.So as Mr Murphy bows out, who could replace him?The deputy leader Kezia Dugdale may want to step up or Neil Findlay could try again after challenging last time. Maybe the party's finance spokeswoman Jackie Baillie thinks her steady hand could steer the ship.Jenny Marra is also often talked about as future face of the party.Whoever steps into Jim Murphy's red shoes he or she will have to face a difficult 2016 Holyrood election, to put it mildly.There are also more fundamental questions about how the party can possibly move on as it faces a surging SNP.Mr Murphy was very much a creature of ""New Labour"" - but to today's generation that's old Labour.Party members may start looking for someone with no links to the past, neither a Brownite nor a Blairite. A 'cleanskin' - as the politicos put it - may well help re-connect with voters.That's a long way from now though - even some of the party's opponents may view this latest train wreck with a modicum of sympathy. Ms Lamont had resigned after claiming Scottish Labour was treated like a ""branch office"" by the London-based party leadership.Mr Murphy concluded his speech by saying: ""Scotland needs a strong Labour party; Scotland needs a united Labour party. We have been the greatest force for change in our nation's remarkable history. ""The Scottish Labour party will rise again. It will be under someone else's leadership and I am confident about my party's future.""Harriet Harman MP, acting leader of the UK Labour Party, said it would be for Scottish Labour to choose a new leader. She added: ""As a cabinet minister and leader of his party in Scotland, Jim has been a hugely important figure in the Labour Party. He leaves with the best wishes and thanks of our movement.""Labour peer Lord McConnell, a former Scottish first minister, said the party's problems were ""much deeper than one individual and one affiliate"".He said: ""We have a disconnect locally and nationally with wider Scottish society. ""We have a problem with our political positioning in the post devolution age where the party particularly at the UK level has never been comfortable with success in the Scottish parliament and has always tried to see things through a UK prism rather than a Scottish prism.""We need to find a new generation, a new leader, new generation, new ideas, a fresh approach.""In a tweet, Scottish first minister and SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said: ""I wish Jim Murphy all the very best for the future. Leadership is not easy and he deserves credit for standing up for what he believes in.""Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson also reacted on Twitter, saying: ""Jim Murphy announces a managed exit in order to help the party, which is to his credit. But leaves a tough gig for whoever comes next.""The meeting of Scottish Labour's executive was disrupted by protesters who entered the party's headquarters.Police were called and the protesters, who included persistent anti-austerity activists Sean Clerkin and Piers Doughty-Brown, left the building to protest further from the street outside.The protesters were calling for Mr Murphy to remain as leader to ""finish the job of destroying Scottish Labour"".A Police Scotland spokeswoman said officers had been called and found two protestors on the third floor of the building. She added: ""Both left on police arrival. Advice and assistance was given."""
2015-04-24,Labour contenders clash on spending,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32761561,"Prospective Labour leaders have clashed over Labour's record in government in their first public debate in the race to succeed Ed Miliband.Former cabinet ministers including Yvette Cooper and Andy Burnham defended Labour's fiscal record and spending on schools and hospitals.However, candidates from the 2010 intake of MPs argued that the party spent too much while in office.The debate followed Chuka Umunna's withdrawal from the leadership contest.The remaining candidates appeared at the annual conference of the Progress think tank in London.There was agreement that Labour needed to demonstrate economic credibility to regain power, with shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt telling the meeting that the party needed to be ""trusted with public finances and the family finances"".Mr Hunt, who was first elected to Parliament in 2010 when Labour lost power, argued the last Labour government ""spent too much"" and failed to ""leave enough economic headroom to deal with the economic crisis and the recession"".Shadow health minister Liz Kendall said: ""There's absolutely nothing progressive about spending more on debt interest payments than on educating our children.""But shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: ""The Tories have had a triumph of spin over the facts in saying what they said about the economic record of the last Labour government.""The former chief secretary to the Treasury said the deficit did ""grow too large"" in the government's later years but insisted: ""The last Labour government ran more surpluses in its first term than the Tories did in 18 years.""Yvette Cooper, another former chief secretary to the Treasury, said: ""We should never let anybody tell us that it was too many teachers, doctors or nurses that caused Lehman Brothers bank in New York to crash.""Shadow international development secretary Mary Creagh said: ""People have forgotten the economic credibility that the last Labour government had.""She said Labour had built schools and hospitals that were ""treasured in our communities"".Ms Cooper, Mr Burnham, Ms Kendall and Ms Creagh have declared their intention to run for leader, while Mr Hunt told the conference he would make an announcement next week.At the same event, shadow energy secretary Caroline Flint announced she would be running for deputy leader.The Don Valley MP told the Today programme ahead of the debate that Labour lost the election because ""fundamentally the public did not trust us on the economy"".Exeter MP Ben Bradshaw has already announced a bid to be deputy, saying Labour ""must and could win the next election"", but only if it ""broadens its appeal by adopting sensible, centre-left politics which celebrate wealth creation and entrepreneurship"".Former Labour campaign co-ordinator Tom Watson is reported to be crowd-funding a deputy leadership bid, while Walthamstow MP Stella Creasy has said she is ""open to the question"" of running.Barnsley East MP and shadow transport secretary Michael Dugher - a fierce critic of Ed Miliband's election campaign - is to run Mr Burnham's campaign, according to the website LabourList.It is reported that Mr Burnham also has the backing of Labour peer Lord Falconer, who was lord chancellor and justice secretary under Tony Blair and was close to the former PM.Shadow culture secretary Chris Bryant has signalled his backing for Ms Cooper, tweeting that the next leader must be ""someone who's been tried in the fiery furnace of public opinion"".Mr Hunt said on Friday he would be be attending the debate - along with the other four hopefuls - to ""set out my analysis on how we begin to understand what went so wrong and why"".He added: ""We must use this leadership election to ask some very profound questions.""All voices in the party must be heard so that we can have a full and proper assessment as to why the politics of nationalism triumphed in Scotland and huge swathes of England, and how we have allowed the Conservative Party to present a more compelling vision for Britain to so many millions of people.""Speculation still surrounds shadow business secretary Mr Umunna's decision to pull out on Friday, when he said he was not ""comfortable"" with the ""pressure"" of being a candidate.As well as citing extensive pressure and scrutiny Mr Umunna also said he was ruling himself out because of concerns about the impact of the bid on his family.A rising star of the party, Mr Umunna was first elected to Parliament in 2010 - alongside Tristram Hunt and Liz Kendall - before joining the shadow cabinet.Asked about the candidate who might win, Conservative Chancellor George Osborne said: ""The Labour leadership contest has descended into farce.""But it's not actually about personalities. I don't think the Labour Party any more represents the working people of this country who aspire to a better life."""

I'm not suggesting he takes a break from being leader.""Clearly the national executive has the authority, they're the ruling body. ""I'm told that they made a decision. I'm told it was a procedurally correct decision, he is the leader but I think it's important that as leader he takes a break and I think it's important that we work out how these complex questions are answered by a team.""No one person has all the answers. I'm particularly concerned about tone, making sure we get a tone that ensures that the 27 million people who didn't vote for UKIP last week may be persuaded to vote for us in future.""The party has been beset by wrangling since Mr Farage agreed to stay on as leader, days after standing down after failing to get elected in Thanet South.He had pledged before the general election that he would quit the post if he failed to get elected to Parliament.Senior aide Matthew Richardson has left the party, following claims from MEP Patrick O'Flynn that Mr Farage had fallen under the influence of ""inexperienced"" advisers.UKIP has also confirmed the departure of Mr Farage's chief of staff Raheem Kassam.Mr Farage ruled out quitting as leader on BBC's Question Time on Thursday, saying he had ""phenomenal"" support, and has challenged his critics to decide whether they want to stay in the party.In his article, Mr Carswell had said that ""knowing how difficult it is to lead a party makes me admire Nigel Farage all the more"".""I know that I never could,"" he added, stressing that he would find it ""impossible to simultaneously lead UKIP, be the voice of the party in the Commons, represent my Clacton constituents and at the same time be a husband and a dad"".However, he said that ""even leaders need to take a break"", adding: ""Nigel needs to take a break now.""UKIP got nearly four million votes at the election, but returned only one MP - former Conservative Mr Carswell in the Clacton constituency."

Under the plans, ministers could force schools rated as ""requiring improvement"" and missing new government benchmarks to become an academy.Coasting schools have average results which have often flatlined over time.Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, Mrs Morgan said faster action was needed.She said: ""Our big priorities will be to speed up the process for tackling failing schools; extend our academies programme to tackle 'coasting' schools; and deliver on our commitment to open new free schools.""The proposals will be in a new bill due to be introduced in the Queen's Speech. ""First, we will take new powers to step in from the moment that a school is found to be failing,"" Mrs Morgan said.""From day one, regional schools commissioners will be able to bring in new leadership and support from other excellent schools and heads, and we will speed up the process of turning schools into academies to make sure that new expert leadership is found for all schools that need it as quickly as possible.""She said that coasting schools will be put on an immediate notice to improve and could then be taken over and turned into an academy.They will be required to work with a team of ""expert"" head teachers.She said: ""Those that aren't able to demonstrate a clear plan for improvement will be given new leadership - we know this works in turning schools around.""More than 3,300 schools in England are labelled ""requires improvement"", but the plans are unlikely to cover that many schools.Under the current system, secondary schools are considered to be failing, and therefore eligible for intervention, if fewer than 40% of their students score at least five Cs at GCSE, including English and maths, and they do not meet national averages in pupil progress.In primary schools, the threshold for intervention is if fewer than 65% of pupils get Level 4 in reading, writing and maths and a below average number of pupils make the expected amount of progress.It is not yet clear how coasting schools will be deemed in need of intervention.It is understood that a new category will be devised covering schools which are rated as ""requires improvement"" and which fail to meet a new set of standards on improvement."
2015-04-24,Co-op Group to keep political funding,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-32762858,"The Co-operative Group has decided to continue financially supporting the Co-operative Party, which has strong ties to Labour.Members of the group, the UK's biggest mutual organisation, voted on the issue at their annual general meeting.They passed a motion by 48,579 for, to 39,479 against, to approve ""political expenditures"" of up to £1m which support the movement's objectives.Last year the Co-op Group gave £625,000 to the Co-op Party.This figure was down on the sums donated in previous years. The AGM also included a vote on new corporate governance procedures which would mean members having less of a direct say.The Co-operative Group is still recovering from a period of financial mismanagement and some members have recently expressed concerns about how elections to the board are chosen.The banking arm of the group came close to collapse in 2013, bringing the whole group to a £2.5bn annual loss that year. The Co-op Party includes among its members a number of Labour MPs, including shadow chancellor Chris Leslie and Walthamstow MP Stella Creasy. The politicians stand as candidates of both the Co-operative Party and the Labour Party, and the two political movements have strong historical ties. The board asked the members of the Co-operative Group whether they wanted to continue financially supporting the Co-operative Party, or any other party. Allan Leighton, chairman of the Co-op Group, said: ""There's a clear remit from the members to continue to support the Labour Party.""It allows us to now have a conversation with the Co-op Labour Party about what we do next.""There was also a members' motion on the agenda, put forward by those in favour of making political donations of up to £1m a year.The motion to approve political funding ""not to exceed £1m per annum"" was carried by 55.17% to 44.83%.BBC business correspondent Joe Lynam said: ""To meet a £1.5bn hole in its accounts - mostly stemming from its banking division - the Co-op Group has had to sell off parts of its businesses and hand over majority control of its bank to American hedge funds.""It's also in the process of radically changing the way it runs itself into a more corporate structure with less of a direct say by its members.""He said that ""in theory"", each of the 2.8 million Co-op members could vote on a series of motions about the reforms, as well as how its bosses are paid, and retaining the links to the Co-operative party.One of the group's largest independent societies, Midcounties, recently threatened legal action over a shortlist of six candidates for the group's board being reduced to three - the number of positions available - before a member vote.

2015-04-24,Osborne plans July 'stability' Budget,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32761566,"Chancellor George Osborne has said that he will deliver a new Budget on 8 July.He claimed it would have ""a laser-like focus"" on raising productivity and living standards.He said he was making the unusual move of having a second Budget in one year in order to ""deliver on the commitments we have made to working people"".Labour said the chancellor would have to set out ""who is going to pay"" for what it called ""uncosted promises"" in the election campaign.Speaking outside 11 Downing Street, the chancellor gave a broad outline of his plans for the forthcoming Budget but refused to be drawn on the details, including the Conservatives' planned £12bn of welfare cuts.""I don't want to wait to deliver on the commitments we have made to working people,"" he said.""It will continue with the balanced plan we have to deal with our debts, invest in our health service and reform welfare to make work pay.""But there will also be a laser-like focus on making our economy more productive so we raise living standards across our country.""We're going to put Britain into good shape for the long term.""The last Budget was held on 18 March and included tax cuts for first-time house buyers.Writing in the Sun, Mr Osborne admitted it was ""unusual"" to have two Budgets in the same year, but he wanted to turn ""promises made in the election into a reality"".Again, Mr Osborne did not specifically outline how the Conservatives plan to fulfil a pledge to cut £12bn in welfare spending but said he wants to make the welfare system ""fair for the people who pay for it"".He writes: ""We will protect the NHS and give it more funding each and every year, while making savings across Whitehall. ""We'll crack down hard on tax avoidance and aggressive tax planning by the rich - because everyone should pay their fair share.  ""We will always protect the most vulnerable, but we also need a welfare system that's fair to the people who pay for it. If you can work you should be working, so we'll take the next steps in our benefit reforms to make sure that happens.""Second, we've got to go on helping businesses create jobs in Britain, so we move towards full employment. That means facing a hard truth: in Britain we produce about a quarter less for every hour we work than countries like America or Germany. Fixing that long-running productivity weakness is the big challenge for the next five years.""So in the Budget we'll spend less on welfare, and instead invest to create three million more apprenticeships, so that young people can learn a trade, get better jobs and earn more.""After the Budget in March independent forecaster the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said that Mr Osborne needed to spell out exactly how he plans to cut £12bn from welfare spending.Of those £12bn planned cuts, £2bn were outlined ahead of the general election - all the cuts are supposed to be in place by 2017-18.Labour's shadow energy and climate change secretary, Caroline Flint, accused the Tories of making ""a number of uncosted promises"" during the election campaign.She told the BBC: ""It will be interesting to see who is going to pay for those uncosted policies when they bring the Budget in July."""
2015-04-24,Farage should take a break - Carswell,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32761766,"UKIP leader Nigel Farage ""needs to take a break now"", the party's only MP Douglas Carswell has said.Writing in the Times, Mr Carswell said he admired Mr Farage, but questioned his ""ill-advised"" comments about HIV patients, made in a TV leaders' debate.Mr Farage ruled out quitting as leader on BBC's Question Time on Thursday, saying he had ""phenomenal"" support.It follows a bitter internal row within the party, which has seen two of Mr Farage's senior aides resigning.In his article, Mr Carswell said that ""knowing how difficult it is to lead a party makes me admire Nigel Farage all the more"".""I know that I never could,"" he added, stressing that he would find it ""impossible to simultaneously lead UKIP, be the voice of the party in the Commons, represent my Clacton constituents and at the same time be a husband and a dad"".However, he said that ""even leaders need to take a break"", adding: ""Nigel needs to take a break now.""He described Mr Farage as ""inspirational"", saying the party had ""done extraordinarily well"" under his leadership but now needed to ""consider carefully what comes next"".Earlier, Mr Farage challenged his critics to decide whether they wanted him to stay in the party.He said he had ""massive"" support from UKIP MEPs, donors and party members to continue in the role, suggesting one person, whom he did not name, was ""agitating for change"".Addressing the prospect of a future EU referendum, Mr Carswell said: ""All of us UKIP supporters should ask one question; Is what I'm doing at this moment making an 'out' vote more likely? If it isn't, stop it and do something else.""He also criticised Mr Farage's comments about HIV patients during the TV leaders' debate last month.While debating about the NHS, Mr Farage said: ""You can come into Britain from anywhere in the world and get diagnosed with HIV and get the retro-viral drugs that cost up to £25,000 per year per patient.""Mr Carswell wrote: ""By all means we should highlight the problem of health tourism. But we need to admit that using the example of HIV patients to make the point was ill-advised.""He said the party needed to strike ""the right tone"" and added: ""UKIP has been at its most persuasive when we have been most optimistic.""Anger is never a great way to motivate people - at least not for very long.""The party has been beset by wrangling since Mr Farage agreed to stay on as leader, days after standing down after failing to get elected in Thanet South.He had pledged before the general election that he would quit the post if he failed to get elected to Parliament.Matthew Richardson has left the party, following claims from MEP Patrick O'Flynn that Mr Farage had fallen under the influence of ""inexperienced"" advisers. UKIP has also confirmed the departure of Mr Farage's chief of staff Raheem Kassam.UKIP got nearly four million votes at the election, but returned only one MP - former Conservative Mr Carswell in the Clacton constituency."

They absolutely loved how he helped them and he was a highly-regarded local MP,"" Mr Bone said.""He stood up for what was right rather than what the party line was. In those days - the John Major years - it was much more difficult to stand up against the party machine. He had strong views on Europe.""Sir Peter started his career as an insurance broker, joining the Wycombe Young Conservatives in 1949 and the Oxford University Conservative Association in 1951.He went on to become a Conservative councillor on Buckinghamshire County Council between 1961 and 1967.Wellingborough mayor-elect Barry Graves also paid tribute to Sir Peter, remembering him as a ""very strong constituency MP"".""I remember going out and canvassing with him and he would go everywhere. He knew the area and the people. He was very much a man of the local constituency.""He was ""a very approachable man"", Mr Graves added.Sir Peter was knighted in 1994. "

2015-04-24,PM will 'look at' powers proposals,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32746049,"David Cameron has said he would ""look at"" any proposals for further powers for Scotland but wants to get the Smith Commission plans implemented first.The prime minister was speaking after meeting Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon in Edinburgh.Mr Cameron said he made a ""commitment"" to include a devolution bill in the Queen's Speech later this month.Ms Sturgeon argued the Smith Commission proposals were ""a good starting point"" but did not go far enough.The prime minister has pledged to include a bill on devolution in this month's Queen's Speech which would be based on the cross-party Smith Commission agreement. The Smith proposals included giving Holyrood the power to set income tax rates and bands, as well as control over a share of VAT and some welfare benefits. But Ms Sturgeon's SNP also wants the Scottish Parliament to be given powers over business taxes, employment law, the minimum wage and additional powers over welfare.Speaking after meeting Ms Sturgeon, Mr Cameron told the BBC: ""Let's make sure Smith is implemented in full. I'm going to keep the commitment I made to the people of Scotland. Let's get that done first because it does create a really strong Scottish Parliament.""He added: ""Of course, if people want to make future proposals I'll look at them.""The prime minister again said he did not support full fiscal autonomy for Scotland - the responsibility for all areas of tax and spending except defence and foreign affairs - stating that it would mean £7bn of cuts or extra tax-raising.What Nicola Sturgeon is trying to say is she has a mandate. She has 56 out of the 59 MPs elected in Scotland and she won 50% of the vote - unprecedented here in Scotland.She says that gives her leverage to push David Cameron. David Cameron says he wants to keep the nation together.The language coming out of Westminster last week was very much a cordial one. 'We will listen'.Nicola Sturgeon has warned him that if he doesn't listen, then the people of Scotland will judge him accordingly.Ms  Sturgeon described the hour-long talks at her official residence at Bute House as ""constructive and business-like"". She said Mr Cameron had made a ""commitment"" that the Smith proposals would be implemented ""as agreed"".""But secondly the prime minister agreed that he would look at proposals that we would now send to suggest the areas we can go beyond Smith,"" Ms Sturgeon said.""There was no agreement in terms of the substance of that but we will submit those proposals, the prime minister has said they will consider them and there will be a meeting to look at how we take that further forward.""Referring to her party's success in last week's general election, which saw the SNP win 56 out of 59 Scottish seats, Ms Sturgeon said: ""People in Scotland have now voted fairly convincingly for the SNP and sent a message that we want the Smith Commission proposals to go further and be built on.""The ball is in his court but I'm going into this in good faith.""She added: ""David Cameron and I are a world apart politically but, where we can, I'm determined to do business in the interests of the people of Scotland and across the UK.""She said she would have a ""constructive and business-like"" relationship with the prime minister. The two leaders shook hands on the front steps of Bute House as Mr Cameron arrived. Mr Cameron left the building shortly before 11:00, almost an hour after he had arrived.The two sides agreed to hold more regular discussions in the future, possibly quarterly. "

I'm human, the rest of my life is more important to me than politics.""The shadow business secretary has been distressed by the degree of scrutiny he, his family and his girlfriend have come under since he declared his intention to stand for the labour leadership.I am told that this includes reporters waiting outside the houses of relatives late at night.Friends of Mr Umunna deny that he is nervous of not getting the support of enough MPs to run for the leadership; they point out that he already has half the necessary names and that there are some weeks to go.The shadow business secretary now wants to play a leading role in arguing that Britain should stay in the EU and does not rule out seeking the leadership in the future.He said he thought he had understood ""the scrutiny and attention a leadership contest would bring"", but added: ""However, since the night of our defeat last week I have been subject to the added level of pressure that comes with being a leadership candidate.""The shadow business secretary said he had wondered if it was too soon for him to stand for the leadership, and ""I fear it was."" He also cited concerns about the impact on ""the rest of one's life"" and those close to him.""Consequently, after further reflection, I am withdrawing my candidacy,"" he said.Mr Umunna said he would continue to serve as shadow business secretary and hoped to ""play a leading role"" in Labour's campaign to keep the UK in the EU during the forthcoming in/out referendum.Commenting on the news, Labour former culture secretary Ben Bradshaw - who is expected to run for deputy leader - said Mr Umunna was a ""terrible loss"" to the field.He told the BBC's Daily Politics the Streatham MP had been the candidate the Conservative Party ""feared the most"".""And if it's the result of pressure on an extended family or an extended group of friends, I think that's a very sad reflection on our political culture,"" he said.Chuka Umunna feels ""liberated"", he told me, by his decision to quit the Labour leadership race.He hopes to be given a good role (shadow chancellor, I wonder?) by whoever becomes Labour leader. And I expect he'll become very high profile in the campaign to keep Britain in Europe, which is increasingly looking like it will be next May.He'll endorse a candidate in the next four weeks before nominations close. It will be very interesting to see who he piles in behind.Read more from Allegra (see post 13.23).Former Labour leader Lord Kinnock said he thought Mr Umunna had made the right decision.He said: ""If he felt in his soul that he wasn't prepared to subject himself - and more importantly his family - to the kind of attention which is fairly typical, sadly, these days, he has done absolutely the right thing.""There is no point at all in inflicting avoidable, unnecessary misery on those you love most.""Leadership contender Mary Creagh said she had ""huge respect"" for Mr Umunna, telling BBC Radio 4's World at One programme it took ""courage"" to withdraw from the leadership race.Mr Umunna was ""a big beast"" and would play a ""big role"" in the future of the Labour Party, she added.Yvette Cooper, Andy Burnham, Liz Kendall and Mary Creagh have already thrown their hats into the ring for Labour's top job while a number of other potential candidates, including Dan Jarvis, Alan Johnson and David Lammy, have ruled themselves out. Candidates must secure nominations from 34 colleagues - 15% of the party's MPs - by 15 June to make it on to ballot papers, which will be sent to members in August ahead of the leader's election a month later."

However, Mr Justice Stuart Smith at Southwark Crown Court said there was a ""very strong likelihood"" a custodial sentence would follow.The jury heard how Mote submitted numerous false expenses claims for payment for work that organisations had allegedly carried out on his behalf.Mote claimed the money was to pay whistleblowers in cash through third parties. He also said he had been ""targeted for being an anti-EU MEP.""During his time an MEP he also made £250,000 legitimate expenses claims.No date has been set for the sentencing."

2015-04-24,Round-up: BBC experts' analysis,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/election-2015-32650417,"The political future of the United Kingdom has become clearer after the results of the general election emerged around the country.David Cameron says he hopes to govern for all of the UK after the Conservatives took 331 seats - enough to form a slender majority in the Commons.Labour has been all but wiped out by the SNP in Scotland and suffered a disappointing set of results elsewhere, while the Lib Dems are left with just eight MPs after many party heavyweights such as Vince Cable and Danny Alexander lost their seats.So with battles won and lost and the fall-out and celebrations beginning, BBC correspondents examine the implications and challenges that lie ahead for the new government - and for those whose political careers have been ended by voters.No pollster, no pundit, no political leader saw it coming - not even David Cameron himself.Governing parties don't gain seats. Parties that have implemented painful cuts and are promising more certainly don't. Until that is the Conservative Party did - achieving what had seemed to be Mission Impossible - a Tory majority.Until that is David Cameron's personal triumph which triggered the near simultaneous resignation of his three principle opponents - Messrs Miliband, Clegg and Farage.They did so in part because they helped to crush their partners in coalition these last five years - reducing the Liberal Democrat parliamentary party to a size when it can fit into two London taxis and still have two seats to spare.In part because the extraordinary tidal wave of support for the SNP swept dozens of once safe Labour seats away.In part because Nigel Farage persuaded millions to vote for him but secured just one seat - not, though, the one he was standing in.Read more from Nick Robinson hereThe question uppermost in the prime minister's mind as he assembles his new government is how to keep the kingdom united.""Above all I want to bring our country together,"" he revealed after the result, ""to reclaim a mantle we should never have lost - the mantle of one nation, one United Kingdom"".Looking at the political landscape from Land's End today is very different to the view from John O'Groats.A sea of Conservative and Unionist blue dominates the scene across much of England, while a field of SNP nationalist yellow stretches to the horizon and beyond from the north.David Cameron's greatest challenge is to prevent the union he supports being torn apart by mutual resentment - resentment from Scotland at a Westminster government dominated by English Tories, and resentment from England at the preferential treatment people think is being given to the Scots.Those who assumed the future of the Union had been safeguarded by the Scottish referendum must think again.Read more from Mark Easton hereOne thing is rock-solid true: the Conservatives who worked on this campaign are as surprised by the result as the pollsters, pundits, politicians and general population.Maybe they shouldn't be - the economy is in good shape and the Conservatives had incumbency advantage.But when I travelled back from the prime minister's last rally with a group of exhausted Conservative campaign officials it was clear that 290 seats was a hoped-for target.No-one talked about anything over 300 seats, and no-one even mentioned an overall majority.So what special sauce pushed David Cameron into No 10 with a Commons majority?Mr Cameron had two simple messages in the campaign and he rarely veered away from them; the first - the economy is in good shape and the recovery is threatened by Labour. And the second - the SNP would hold a Labour-led government to ransom.Read more from Jonny Dymond hereBrian Taylor, BBC political editor, ScotlandOf all the comments on the overnight apocalypse, undoubtedly the most straightforward came from a defeated Scottish Labour MP.Since there were quite a few of them, let me narrow the focus a little. Come on down, Tom Harris.Mr Harris had plainly anticipated defeat. Nonetheless, he looked suitably lugubrious as his fate was confirmed.Why, he was asked eagerly, had Labour lost? ""Because we did not win enough votes.""Psephologically, it is perfect. Complete in itself. Psychologically, it sums up Labour's gloom without descending into subsidiary matters such as leadership, strategy and the rest. As a forward-thinking strategy, it is ideal. Win more votes. Simple.Read more from Brian Taylor hereThis has been an election which may have more profound consequences than almost any in living memory.We now face a generational decision about our future in Europe, with an EU referendum in two years' time almost certain.There will also be serious questions about the future of the Union, following an SNP landslide that has turned Scotland into a virtual one-party state.David Cameron's victory also represents a colossal achievement.Only once before in recent history has an incumbent government increased its majority - and that was Mrs Thatcher in her prime in the 1980s.It is also a significant personal victory for Mr Cameron and a rebuff for those in his party who had become increasingly sceptical about his ability to win.But while it may represent a defeat for those Tories who saw this election as a potential opportunity to rid themselves of David Cameron, he must now govern with a wafer-thin majority.For the SNP, their stunning victory can only increase the pressure on Nicola Sturgeon to include a commitment to a second independence referendum in her party's manifesto for next year's Scottish elections.It is an election which has not just defied all the predictions of the pollsters and pundits - but which may yet prompt the most fundamental re-casting of British politics for a generation.Read more from Norman Smith hereAfter an extraordinary night, some brief conclusions:Read more from James Landale hereIs this the end of the union?That is the question many people will be asking this morning after the party which has fought for Scottish independence for 80 years swept to victory.The answer from the jubilant Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon is a firm ""No"".She insists that her MPs will speak for all of Scotland, not just for the 45% who voted for the country to leave the United Kingdom last September.In the closing hours of the most extraordinary election campaign which anyone in Scotland can remember, Ms Sturgeon turned to talk of ""legitimacy.""That will be her watchword in the coming days as she argues that the prime minister cannot ignore the democratic will of the Scottish people.Politically, Scotland and England this morning look and feel like very different countries.Read more from James Cook hereAfter weeks of chatter about an election too close to call, it wasn't that close at all.David Cameron will be continuing as our prime minister.So, what is all this likely to mean?A referendum on whether the UK stays in, or leaves, the European Union, within the next two-and-a-half years.A race to be the next leader of the Labour Party.A race to be the next leader of the Liberal Democrats.And a huge new presence of Scottish National Party MPs at Westminster.And so here's another thing we know for certain this morning: Politics ain't going to be boring any time soon.Read more from Chris Mason hereFor Labour the story of their terrible night is rapidly turning into the search for a new leader. So who will that be?Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, is almost certain to run.  Even before this election, both he and another almost inevitable candidate, Chuka Umunna, had raised eyebrows inside the party at the work they had put in, preparing the ground with members and the unions for potential bids.Yvette Cooper, before the election, was still thought not to have made up her mind over whether to run. That decision has been made perhaps a little easier as her husband, Ed Balls, has lost his seat.She is certainly potentially in the frame, along with two lesser known names - Liz Kendall and Dan Jarvis - two MPs who were only elected in 2010 for the first time. This could be their moment. But whoever is in the job, they face a monumental task.Read Laura Kuenssberg's Twitter hereSterling is up (the most for seven years against the euro), share prices are up (especially bank shares like Lloyds and RBS, and energy shares such as Centrica), government bond prices are up.To state the obvious, investors love the Tories' general election victory.There are a few reasons.One (no surprise here) is that Labour's threat of breaking up banks and imposing energy price caps has been lifted.Second is that investors have been discounting days and weeks of wrangling after polling day over who would form the government - and so they are semi-euphoric that we already know who's in charge.Third, many investors tend to be economically conservative and instinctively Conservative.But although the City may be a bit drunk on the result, its pleasure in Ed Miliband's and Ed Balls' humiliation may be making it a bit blind - perhaps dangerously so - to some bumps in the economic road ahead.Read more from Robert Peston hereNigel Farage dreamed of holding the balance of power, but in the end his UKIP party is now worse off than when it came into the election.At the seventh time of asking he was rejected - this time by the people of Thanet South. It was a similar story in Rochester and Strood where Mark Reckless, who sensationally defected from the Tories last year, was also sent packing.In seats on UKIP's target list, like Thurrock in Essex, the party failed to make gains. In Grimsby - where Mr Farage went twice in the last six weeks - they came third.UKIP got around four million votes - with especially strong showings in north-east and south-east England - but it's ended up with just one MP, and a vacancy at the top. This has led to UKIP attacking the current system of choosing MPs, which it's described as ""busted"" and ""dysfunctional"".In one sense, this campaign was a complete failure and it's left an aftermath of angry voters, and others wondering if the UKIP bubble has burst.Read Robin Brant's Twitter hereI monitored 91 GB-wide voting intention polls during the 2015 election campaign and found nothing in them to prepare me for the final outcome.The good news for the pollsters was that their share for the Lib Dems was pretty close, as were the shares for UKIP, the Greens and the catch-all category of Others.The bad news for the polling industry was that the crucial shares for Conservative and Labour were the ones where they came most adrift.When all the qualifications of margins of error are allowed, there did appear to be a systematic overstatement of the Labour share and an equally systematic understatement of the Conservative one.It is for the pollsters to decide whether to conduct a review of their performance but I trust they will avoid the initial knee-jerk reaction of the immediate aftermath of the 1992 polls debacle.This general election performance follows the performance of the polls in the 2014 Scottish referendum where the choice was simply binary and yet all the polls were out by between 4-6%.Something is wrong. A lot of us would like to know what it is.Read more from David Cowling hereThe words ""political earthquake"" have been translated into numerous European languages, making front page news across the continent.While Britons now examine the domestic minutiae of the election result, here in mainland Europe the vote means one thing: a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU.

""We now face a generational decision about our future in Europe, with an EU referendum in two years time almost certain. There will also be serious questions about the future of the Union, following an SNP landslide that has turned Scotland into a virtual one-party state. David Cameron's victory also represents a colossal achievement.""James Landale, deputy political editor: ""After an extraordinary night, some brief conclusions: With a small majority or slight minority for David Cameron, Tory MPs will be much empowered. As such, Mr Cameron will need support from other parties to get business through. The PM will also need a better whips office to handle rebellions.""Laura Kuenssberg, chief correspondent, Newsnight: ""For Labour the story of their terrible night is rapidly turning into the search for a new leader. So who will that be? Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, is almost certain to run.

2015-04-24,A history of political plots,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32749971,"Nigel Farage has apparently seen off a challenge to his leadership of UKIP - a move described by his former election strategist as a ""coup"". He's not the only party leader to face an attempted ousting. But can you recover from such a revolt?In 2006, the Labour prime minister was the target of what became known as the ""curry house conspiracy"" - a coup to remove him and install his chancellor, Gordon Brown, as prime minister.It would lead to several of the plotters' resignations - but not Mr Blair's. However, it was successful to a degree in that it forced the party leader into naming a departure date.The move against him was reportedly masterminded by Tom Watson, a defence minister at the time, who was also rumoured to have had a secret meeting with Mr Brown on the eve of the revolt.Apparently, Mr Watson and three fellow West Midlands MPs - Sion Simon, David Wright (both ministerial aides) and Khalid Mahmood - met over a biryani at a Wolverhampton curry house to discuss the PM's future, before dispatching a missive calling for him to quit.The letter - which attracted the support of a number of normally loyal Labour MPs - was leaked to the press, and ultimately resulted in Mr Watson's resignation.In his parting letter, the West Bromwich East MP took a shot at the prime minister, who he said should step down in the interests of party and country.Mr Blair denounced his actions and branded the former minister ""disloyal, discourteous and wrong"", saying he would have sacked him if he had not resigned.But Mr Watson's departure was swiftly followed by the resignations of six other junior members of government - who had also signed the rebel letter - in protest at the prime minister's refusal to say when he would step down as Labour leader.The whole affair resulted in Mr Blair announcing his intention to step aside within 12 months - which he duly did, on 27 June 2007.But it did nothing to quash internal dissent and speculation in the party over the future leadership of the party.Labour prime minister Gordon Brown found his leadership under threat in 2009 after one of his cabinet ministers dramatically quit the government and called for him to resign.Work and Pensions Secretary James Purnell - a former aide to Tony Blair - resigned from his post after the polls closed in the local and European elections, in which Labour was forecast to do badly.Explaining his decision to quit, Mr Purnell said the prime minister made a Conservative victory ""more, not less, likely"".It was Mr Brown's first direct challenge from a cabinet minister - but it would not topple the Labour leader as senior members of government refused to follow Mr Purnell's lead.Mr Brown was safe for the time being. But several months later, in January 2010, a fresh leadership challenge was mounted by two senior former Labour cabinet ministers.Geoff Hoon and Patricia Hewitt wrote to all Labour MPs, saying the party was ""deeply divided"" over Mr Brown's leadership and that the best way to resolve the issue was by way of secret ballot.They insisted it was not an ""attempted coup"" but a necessary step to resolve divisions within the party.But the duo could only muster the public support of a handful of backbenchers long-opposed to Mr Brown, with the majority of the party's MPs less than impressed by the move, which came just weeks before the general election.As the day wore on, a succession of cabinet ministers came out to back the PM, suggesting there was little momentum behind the plot - although it was noted that several were not exactly gushing in their support of Mr Brown.As history tells us, neither leadership challenge bore fruit but they reflected the internal doubts and divisions over Mr Brown at the helm.As leadership toppling attempts go, this one in 2014 was regarded as a particularly ""botched"" and ""shambolic coup"". Indeed, former Lib Dem leader Lord (Paddy) Ashdown described the move as a ""plot of deep malice"".Its instigator, Lord (Matthew) Oakeshott - a close ally of the-then Business Secretary Vince Cable - tried to unseat Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg.The peer was found to have commissioned secret polls suggesting the party would do better at the 2015 general election without Mr Clegg in the driving seat.The man Lord Oakeshott had long had in mind to take Mr Clegg's place - Mr Cable, who was on government business in China at the time - was forced to publicly condemn his friend's actions and state his backing for Mr Clegg.But Lord Oakeshott said the business secretary had in fact known about his polls and their findings.Nevertheless, the peer - who was denounced by the Lib Dem leadership for spending money that could have been spent on campaigning - quit the party, and issued a warning shot on his way out about the Lib Dems' future prospects.Mr Cable largely emerged unscathed but he faced questions about his loyalty to the leader. Although the two sought to put paid to reports of a rift with a (painfully awkward, 'nothing to see here, folks') stage-managed pint in a pub.Although the revolt failed, and Mr Clegg remained at the helm, the Lib Dems did go on to suffer a trouncing at the general election, losing nearly 50 of its MPs - one of them, Mr Cable himself - prompting his leader to quit.The Conservatives have a reputation for being more ruthless than their party rivals when it comes to getting rid of leaders they sense are no longer effectual.But, in 1995, Prime Minister John Major - tired of persistent rumours of a leadership challenge - decided to take the bull by the horns and trigger a surprise leadership election to silence his detractors.His own backbenchers had questioned Mr Major's ability to unite and lead the party, which was deeply divided over Europe.So ""put up or shut up"", he told them as he tendered his resignation as Conservative Party leader but not prime minister.But then stepped forward eurosceptic MP John Redwood, who resigned from the cabinet in order to contest Mr Major's leadership.This was unexpected by many, as the PM had said there had been assurances from his cabinet that none would stand against him.But Mr Major went on to win the ensuing election with a comfortable defeat over his challenger, who was not included in the PM's consequent cabinet reshuffle.No further contested leadership election took place until after the Conservatives' defeat at the 1997 general election, paving the way for William Hague to take over the running of the party.Not all attempts to oust a party leader end in failure: as Margaret Thatcher found out to her peril.With three electoral victories under her belt, the Conservative prime minister's downfall would come at the hands of her own party - not the voters.It was on 1 November 1990 when Geoffrey (now Lord) Howe - one of Mrs Thatcher's longest-serving ministers - resigned over differences with the party leader over Europe.In his now infamous speech on the floor of the House of Commons, he attacked the PM's policies and leadership style, comparing being one of her cabinet ministers to opening the batting at cricket only to find his bat had been ""broken... by the team captain"".It sparked the beginning of the end of the 11-year Thatcher reign.Michael (now Lord) Heseltine seized on the opportunity to challenge the prime minister in the ensuing leadership contest, from which she would eventually withdraw and John Major emerge as her successor. Reflecting on the revolt and its implications on the Conservative Party, Baroness Thatcher's biographer Charles Moore wrote: ""Because the coup was unjustified, and so trust broke down, the politics of the next 15 years were those of civil war."""
2015-04-24,Election swings and roundabouts,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-32741924,"If election manifesto claims are all about smoke and mirrors, should we now add swings and roundabouts to the political metaphor?There's an intriguing aspect to the general election results in the Midlands that puzzled me.It's the striking contrast in the swings between Labour and the Conservatives.David Cameron and his campaign strategists knew they were home and dry when Nuneaton was the first Midlands marginal to declare.It was not only a Tory hold but a swing to the Conservatives from Labour of 3%.I was in the Nottingham suburb of Beeston awaiting the result of the Broxtowe count. Would its high profile Conservative MP Anna Soubry survive a red surge?Nuneaton set the pattern. Across the Midlands, both east and west, there was a uniform swing of between three and four per cent to the Tories - Warwickshire North 3%, Amber Valley 4%, Derbyshire South 4% and Sherwood 4%. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan topped the Tory swingometer in the Midlands marginals with 5% in Loughborough.Yet in the big cities, it was a very different story. The swing went to Labour.So in Nottingham East they enjoyed a 6% swing, Nottingham South 5.8%, Leicester South 7.3%, Leicester West 5%, Birmingham Hall Green 12%, Birmingham Hodge Hill 8%.If swings to Labour on this scale had gone beyond the city ring road roundabouts and into the suburbs, Ed Miliband would have become prime minister by now.In confidence, one senior Labour insider in Nottingham told me its success in the city wards was down to organisation, experience and its teams of activists.""We won the ground war. If Nottingham's city boundaries were extended into Sherwood and Broxtowe, we would have won those constituencies as well,"" he told me.Labour leadership candidate, Leicester West's Liz Kendall has identified her party's problem beyond the ring road roundabout.It's about reaching out to Middle England.""We need to show people that we understand their aspirations and ambitions for the future,"" she told the Sunday Times.The problem for Labour was that Middle England was not interested in what the party offered…and still isn't. The Cameron brand worked its magic in those Midlands marginals... it'll take something or someone special to break up that ballot box relationship."
2015-04-24,Royal 'lobbying',https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32740154,"Prince Charles sent 27 letters to then Prime Minister Tony Blair and members of his government between September 2004 and March 2005, ""despite the Freedom of Information Act!"" as the prince joked in one.But did his suggestions and concerns have any bearing on the behaviour of Mr Blair's government?The request: Prince Charles expresses his worries over an EU directive on complementary medicines ""which is… effectively outlawing the use of certain herbal extracts"".  Mr Blair replied, offering moral support and practical help. He agreed that ""the implementation as it is currently planned is crazy"" and set out an action plan that included delaying implementation for all existing products to 2011. What happened: Herbal products were not required to be authorised until 2011, just as Mr Blair had promised. Prince Charles continues to sell his own brand of complementary products, Duchy Herbals, through Boots and Waitrose. The request: Writing to Mr Blair, the prince expresses a ""growing sense of anxiety"" that the Hill Farming Allowance, which supports farmers working on Britain's uplands, could be scrapped. In his reply, the prime minister said he understood that the Hill Farm Allowance would continue until 2007. What happened: The allowance lasted until the end of Labour's tenure in 2010, when it was abolished.The request: Just 18 months after the US-led invasion of Iraq, Prince Charles raised the issue of poor performance of Lynx helicopters in high temperatures, saying: ""I fear that this is just one more example of where our Armed Forces are being asked to do an extremely challenging job (particularly in Iraq) without the necessary resources.""Mr Blair replied: ""On the subject of the Lynx helicopter, the limitations of the existing platform, particularly in the extremely challenging environment within Iraq, are well recognised by the Ministry of Defence."" He added that replacement of the helicopters would be a priority. What happened: Mr Blair's comments go much further than what he was saying about the subject at the time. In the event, though, the fleet was not fully upgraded until 2011.The request: Prince Charles lamented that the government's TB prevention plans might not ""include a commitment to deal with the badger problem in the immediate future"" and pushed strongly for a cull, saying: ""All I can say is that I do urge you to look again at introducing a proper cull of badgers where it is necessary.""Mr Blair sympathised, saying he could ""personally see the case for culling badgers"". However, he was unwilling to commit to a cull.  What happened: Culling trials were conducted from 1998-2005. The final results, published in 2008, said that the badger cull could ""make no meaningful contribution"" to curbing bovine TB. It wasn't until 2013 that a full culling programme began in two pilot areas. These ended with the conclusion that the pilots had been neither humane nor effective at curbing the spread of TB.The request: Then Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell wrote to Prince Charles to say she had decided to give parts of the historic Smithfield meat market Grade II listed status, and was trying to persuade deputy prime minister John Prescott to ""call in"" the planning application to prevent demolition of other parts of the site. She had been swayed by evidence provided by Sir Neil Cossons, who was English Heritage chair at the time, after he had been asked by the prince to add his support. Prince Charles replied that he was ""extremely glad to read of your appreciation of the value of this group of buildings"". According to the Guardian, market workers desperate to see the redevelopment of the site invited the prince to meet them to discuss it, but his office said he was ""unlikely to accept as he did not want to interfere in the planning process"".What happened: Smithfield market is still the subject of planning battles a decade on. Successive planning applications have been refused by ministers. Last year then Communities Secretary Eric Pickles rejected plans for an office development on the site, stating that ""the extent of damage that the application would cause to the important heritage assets at Smithfield runs entirely counter to national and policy objectives intended to protect such assets from harm"".In March, the Museum of London announced a move from its current Barbican site to the Smithfield market building."
2015-04-24,Election fallout,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32703139,"""Some of those gimmicks - that tombstone, whatever idiot thought that up I do not know!""I was talking to the former Mayor of Crawley in Sussex, John Mortimer, in the town's Labour Supporters Club about the vexed question of what went wrong, and where Labour should go next. This seat is one of those southern seats Labour hoped to take, but failed.I hear a whole range of views in the club.""They didn't give nothing to depend on, they should be clear, and a little bit more down to Earth."" ""Good party, wrong leader, they don't look after business enough.""Councillor John Stanley tells me: ""I think in a way we did go too left, but now we can go a bit centre-left, or centre, depending who the new leader is.""The former mayor sums up the mood on the doorstep: ""Whatever we told them, they didn't believe us.""  Expect to hear all those views, and more, in the coming leadership contest. Step back from the angst of supporters, and it may not be that hard to see why Labour failed.  An economic recovery, hailed by independent organisations as the result of government policy, undid a party that had loudly proclaimed for five years that the coalition's policies would lead to economic disaster. Combine that with an uncharismatic and uninspirational leader, then you might argue no further debate is necessary.Fat chance of that. Defeat breeds resentment, and this one has opened up old divisions.  A chorus of Blairties, led by the man himself, has declared that Ed's problem was ignoring those with aspiration and ambition, failing to appeal to those running business. Incidentally, I've been ticked off by the perspicacious editor of the New Statesman, Jason Cowley, for using the ""unhelpful"" term ""Blairites"".I can't think of another description that fits Tony, Lord Mandelson, Lord Adonis and David Miliband quite so well. But call them what you will, the message was clear - Ed was too left wing, Labour should move back to the centre, or, if you like, to the right.Reading Mr Blair's pithy analysis, listening to Lord Mandelson's gripping and savage eloquence, describing a party sent out to shout: ""We love the poor and hate the rich,"" and so ignoring the middle, and you realise strong emotions are in play.But back to the future may not be sufficient. Of course elections are won on the centre ground. But grandees grinding axes, affronted by the failure of boys who used to make their tea, may be creating so much noise that they can't hear more insistent sounds.  For there are several elephants trumpeting loudly as they cram into the small space of the shadow cabinet room. Imagine these beasts are as gaily decorated as Berlin buddy bears. One is decked out in red, another in imperial purple bunting, and another, a mammoth, strong tusked and ice rimmed, painted yellow with tartan trimmings.Take the last first. The Scottish wipeout is Labour's biggest problem. Fail to solve it, and Labour can forget ever having a comfortable majority again. It is hard to argue Labour were wiped out in Scotland because the SNP outflanked them to the right with their appeal to the business community and the ambitious and aspirational. But it is true the SNP drew in to people from left, right and centre, just as the modernisers say Labour should. It was the politics of economic self-interest, but cast in a very different light. Tribally sneering at ""the reactionary ideology of nationalism"" as Mr Blair does, will not reach the central belt of Scotland, the middle ground of  Midlothian.What about that purple pachyderm?  In Crawley - in fact in seat after seat - there is a similar pattern.  Labour did, in fact, often increase the size of their vote. So did the Conservatives, usually by a bit more. But the real dynamic was the total collapse of the Lib Dems and the dramatic rise of UKIP. The increase in votes for Nigel Farage's party wasn't translated into parliamentary seats, but, although it is early days in terms of research, it probably hurt Labour a lot. If we believe - and I do - Matthew Goodwin and Rob Ford, authors of Revolt on the Right, these voters are often former Labour supporters - older, less educated, those left behind on the tides of  globalisation, stranded on the shores of post-industrialisation. They may have had too many disappointments to feel much ambition or aspiration. They are a challenge for Labour, and any new leader will spend a good deal of time thinking how to deal with the concerns of Europe and immigration.Whether to share their fears, or confront them will be a big decision.Which brings us to Red Nellie. Those members who still proudly call themselves socialist. This is not about Old Labour - they are more likely to be baristas or barristers than boilermakers. It is easy as an outsider, as a journalist, to treat politics as an intellectual game about how best to win power - but many people, particularly the foot soldiers, particularly after the death of  purely tribal loyalties, are in it because they passionately believe in winning  power to do something specific.Many of them are suspicious of the later incarnations of New Labour, not because it reached an accommodation with wealth and business, but because it seemed to worship at the same altar, to regard the party's core beliefs in redistribution and equality as childish fantasies from a past age.Perhaps to Mr Blair, they are the problem, people who may equate ""ambition"" with greed. They might point out that a man who claims to be worth ""only"" £20m may find it harder than most to squeeze through the eye of a needle to understand their point of view. Most successful Labour leaders will confront the left at some point, but the concerns of this group go to the existential question ""What is the party for?""This is not a polemic - not an argument about what should be done, but a reflection on the complex conundrums that will face any new Labour leader, the tearing apart of the old alliance that made up a Labour majority, and so the political need to satisfy groups with very different, indeed, contradictory demands. But looking for a Social Democratic universal theory of everything may be missing the point. What the party desperately wants is a leader who can pull the disparate threads together and articulate them as common purpose. Whether she or he exists is another matter.Much more on that in the coming months."
2015-04-24,'Take us with you',https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-32736153,"Thousands of people in the north of England have been using the hashtag ""take us with you Scotland"" to express their upset about the result of last week's general election, and Scottish nationalists are welcoming this English minority with open arms. Last Thursday's general election was a rough one for the Labour Party in its traditional stronghold in the north of England. But further to the north, the left-leaning Scottish National Party won nearly every seat it contested. That political contrast has made some left-wing voters in places like Manchester, Leeds and Sheffield look fondly on their neighbours. Since last Thursday's election in Britain the phrase ""take us with you Scotland"" has been used more than 24,000 times. ""Genuinely beginning to wonder if the North of England becoming a part of Scotland would be better for us, I really am,"" tweeted Aaron Miller from Yorkshire. Some cracked jokes under the tag after the North West Motorway Police account, which gives traffic updates, announced that they had ""picked up a pedestrian on the M62 who was trying to walk to Scotland.""After an initial spike of jokes over the weekend, the hashtag really took off when users start to mobilise in support of around a year-old petition on the campaigning site Change.org. The petition calls for the north of England to secede from the rest of the country and join up with Scotland, and more than 12,000 people have signed it.Its creator, a Sheffield resident who calls himself ""Stu Dent"", set it up to coincide with last year's Scottish independence referendum, and he also created a map imagining the boundary of a ""Scotland plus the north"" country.Stu Dent runs the Twitter account Hunters Bar, named after an area of southwest Sheffield which is very popular with - you guessed it - students. Despite the account having thousands of followers on Twitter, when the map was first posted last year, the image was shared only about 100 times - however, in the past week it's been retweeted by thousands. Stu Dent told BBC Trending that he was surprised at how popular his idea has become. ""In hindsight, perhaps I shouldn't have been,"" he said. ""There is a huge frustration in parts of the UK about the things that have happened since 2010.""""I think people need a place to go where they can say 'not in my name!

2015-04-24,What Britain wants from Europe,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32695399,"David Cameron says he has a mandate to pursue EU reform following the Conservatives' general election victory. The PM, who will be hoping his majority government will give him extra leverage in Brussels, wants to renegotiate the terms of the UK's membership ahead of a referendum by the end of 2017. He has said he will campaign for Britain to remain in the EU if he gets the reforms he wants.Mr Cameron has said he does not want to reveal full details of his negotiating hand but he has given a broad indication, in a series of speeches and newspaper articles, of his priorities when he goes into talks with other EU leaders.These are: The prime minister has said Britain would resist any move towards a European Army and that he wants to free British police forces from EU interference. He has also ruled out Britain joining the euro.But he has placed less emphasis in recent years on demanding changes to EU social policy, such as the maximum 48-hour working week, agency workers, maternity leave and non-discrimination rules.The official UK government position is that a referendum will be held by the end of 2017 but Downing Street sources have said: ""If we can do it earlier we will.""There is speculation David Cameron is planning to hold the vote in 2016 to avoid a clash with French and German elections in 2017.The prime minister wants treaty change but even if the referendum was held in 2017 there may not be enough time to legally incorporate any reforms into a treaty and it would have to be done at a later stage.An early referendum would anger Eurosceptics who believe it would not allow enough time to make the case for exit or negotiate any meaningful concessions.""A rushed process would severely undermine the chances to secure a significant deal that both British business and voters could support and would waste the opportunity of a lifetime,"" Matthew Elliott, chief executive of Business for Britain told Breitbart London.The question is always crucial in any referendum and there is already a debate about what it should be. The Draft European Union (Referendum) Bill, published by the Conservatives in 2013, proposed this form of words: ""Do you think that the United Kingdom should remain a member of the European Union?""Some thought that leaned too far towards the status quo, encouraging a yes vote, and the Electoral Commission said it was not clear and direct enough. The watchdog proposed this form of words instead: ""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union?""The new Conservative government will attempt to repeal the Human Rights Act, which requires UK courts to treat the European Court of Human Rights as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. The European Court of Human Rights is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe (CoE), which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine.The freedom for people to move around Europe, enshrined in the EU treaties, works in parallel with the other three basic freedoms in the single market: freedom of goods, capital and services.It is likely to be a ""red line"" for other EU leaders, who do not want to see it eroded.Mr Cameron has steered clear of tackling it directly - for example by asking for an emergency ""brake"" on free movement, or a cap on numbers - focusing instead on reducing the incentive provided by welfare payments. In a speech last November, David Cameron set out measures to reduce the number of EU nationals moving to the UK.His main proposals were:Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission, has said he is ready to work with Mr Cameron to ""strike a fair deal for the United Kingdom in the EU"". The leaders of other EU nations have previously warned they are unlikely to support major changes to EU treaties to accommodate British demands. But Mr Cameron's general election victory may have given him extra leverage. ""The ball is very much in the court of the UK now,"" a senior EU official told The Guardian. ""It's up to the British to define what they want."" The key figure will be German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is very keen to keep Britain in the EU but has so far been unwilling to make major concessions to enable that to happen. There are fears that a ""pick and mix"" approach to EU treaties would undermine EU cohesion.Mr Cameron has said there is ""no doubt"" his planned reforms will require changes to the treaties governing the European Union. But this would require the unanimous support of all EU members, and may not be possible within the deadline he has set of a referendum before the end of 2017. Any attempt to change EU laws on free movement would meet fierce resistance from some EU nations, particularly Eastern European states. Mr Juncker has said free movement is non-negotiable.Mr Cameron may find it difficult to get unanimous support for his proposals for a four-year waiting period for migrant workers claiming UK benefits. East European EU members would be likely to oppose this, on the grounds that it would discriminate against their citizens.  Attempts to secure opt-outs for the City are unlikely to go down well with other European leaders.However, there are precedents for EU treaty changes to accommodate some countries' specific concerns - for example, the protocol attached to the Lisbon Treaty for Ireland.Mr Cameron has faced repeated calls to say whether he would campaign for Britain's exit from the EU in the referendum if he fails to get what he wants from the renegotiation process. All he has said is that he will ""rule nothing out"". Some Conservative MPs want Britain to leave the EU no matter what David Cameron manages to renegotiate. A larger group are likely to want more concessions than Mr Cameron has so far indicated he is prepared to demand.Senior backbencher David Davis, who was defeated by Mr Cameron for the Tory leadership in 2005, told the Daily Telegraph the majority of the 332 Conservative MPs want Mr Cameron to negotiate an ""opt-out"" power to stop individual EU laws from applying to Britain. The prime minister has said this would be ""impossible"" without Britain leaving the EU.Mr Davis claims as many as 60 Tory MPs would be prepared to rebel and vote for Britain's exit from the EU if the prime minister fails to deliver.Graham Brady, chairman of the Tory backbench 1922 committee, which represents backbenchers, has urged David Cameron to give all Conservative MPs, including ministers, a free vote in the EU referendum.In January, Mr Cameron warned that serving cabinet ministers would have to quit the government if they wanted to campaign to leave the EU if he had secured the reforms to it he wants.In the 1975 referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Economic Community, as the EU was then called, Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson decided to suspend collective responsibility because his cabinet was split on the issue. Ministers were allowed to vote with their consciences and campaign against each other. The majority of them, including Mr Wilson, joined the Yes camp, but left-wingers, such as Tony Benn, played a leading role in the No campaign. The Yes campaign won easily with 67% of the vote."

2015-04-25,Scots Labour leader Murphy to resign,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32760196,"Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy is to resign next month, he has announced.It comes despite Mr Murphy narrowly surviving a vote of no confidence at a meeting of the party's national executive in Glasgow. Mr Murphy said he would tender his resignation alongside a plan to reform the party.He lost his seat in last week's general election as the SNP won 56 of the 59 Scottish seats, leaving Labour with a single MP in Scotland.Mr Murphy said he wanted to have a successor as leader in place by the summer, and confirmed he would not be standing for a seat at the Scottish Parliament in next year's election. Instead, he said it was time to ""do something else"" and that he believed the party would continue to be divided if he remained as leader. His deputy, Kezia Dugdale MSP, will become acting leader until a permanent successor is found. Mr Murphy had faced calls to resign from several MSPs, trade unions and former MPs in the wake of his party's near wipeout at the general election.He insisted he had decided to stand down ahead of the national executive voting by 17-14 in favour of him staying in the job.Speaking at a media conference after the national executive meeting, he said: ""It is clear that a small minority who didn't accept my election as leader of the Scottish Labour Party just five months ago won't accept the vote of the executive today and that will continue to divide the party.""Today I received more support in the executive vote than I did from members of the executive when I stood for election five months ago.""He said it would be up to the executive whether to accept the reforms he would be proposing before he left the post. But he warned: ""A party in such urgent need of reform blocks those changes at its peril.""The former East Renfrewshire MP said Labour had been crushed between ""two nationalisms"" in Scotland and England.Mr Murphy said he left no legacy of bitterness for anyone in the Labour Party, and the only person he was angry at was the person who blamed Scottish Labour for the party's UK-wide general election defeat - a reference to Unite leader Len McCluskey.And he said that in many ways Scottish Labour was the ""least modernised part of the Labour movement"" and that he wanted his successor to be elected under a one member, one vote system.Mr Murphy added: ""The Labour Party's problem is not the link with trade unions, or even the relationship with Unite members - far from it. It is the destructive behaviour of one high profile trade unionist.""The leader of the Scottish Labour Party doesn't serve at the grace of Len McCluskey, and the next leader of the UK Labour Party should not be picked by Len McCluskey.""Mr McCluskey has been a vocal critic of Mr Murphy's leadership and opposed his appointment in December when Mr Murphy won the contest to replace Johann Lamont.Jim Murphy laughed and joked with Scottish Labour's sole MP as he made his way down the hotel corridor to announce his resignation.He certainly brought energy and dynamism to his election campaign - but all that achieved was Ian Murray in Edinburgh South.So as Mr Murphy bows out, who could replace him?The deputy leader Kezia Dugdale may want to step up or Neil Findlay could try again after challenging last time. Maybe the party's finance spokeswoman Jackie Baillie thinks her steady hand could steer the ship.Jenny Marra is also often talked about as future face of the party.Whoever steps into Jim Murphy's red shoes he or she will have to face a difficult 2016 Holyrood election, to put it mildly.There are also more fundamental questions about how the party can possibly move on as it faces a surging SNP.Mr Murphy was very much a creature of ""New Labour"" - but to today's generation that's old Labour.Party members may start looking for someone with no links to the past, neither a Brownite nor a Blairite. A 'cleanskin' - as the politicos put it - may well help re-connect with voters.That's a long way from now though - even some of the party's opponents may view this latest train wreck with a modicum of sympathy. Ms Lamont had resigned after claiming Scottish Labour was treated like a ""branch office"" by the London-based party leadership.Mr Murphy concluded his speech by saying: ""Scotland needs a strong Labour party; Scotland needs a united Labour party. We have been the greatest force for change in our nation's remarkable history. ""The Scottish Labour party will rise again. It will be under someone else's leadership and I am confident about my party's future.""Harriet Harman MP, acting leader of the UK Labour Party, said it would be for Scottish Labour to choose a new leader. She added: ""As a cabinet minister and leader of his party in Scotland, Jim has been a hugely important figure in the Labour Party. He leaves with the best wishes and thanks of our movement.""Labour peer Lord McConnell, a former Scottish first minister, said the party's problems were ""much deeper than one individual and one affiliate"".He said: ""We have a disconnect locally and nationally with wider Scottish society. ""We have a problem with our political positioning in the post devolution age where the party particularly at the UK level has never been comfortable with success in the Scottish parliament and has always tried to see things through a UK prism rather than a Scottish prism.""We need to find a new generation, a new leader, new generation, new ideas, a fresh approach.""In a tweet, Scottish first minister and SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said: ""I wish Jim Murphy all the very best for the future. Leadership is not easy and he deserves credit for standing up for what he believes in.""Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson also reacted on Twitter, saying: ""Jim Murphy announces a managed exit in order to help the party, which is to his credit. But leaves a tough gig for whoever comes next.""The meeting of Scottish Labour's executive was disrupted by protesters who entered the party's headquarters.Police were called and the protesters, who included persistent anti-austerity activists Sean Clerkin and Piers Doughty-Brown, left the building to protest further from the street outside.The protesters were calling for Mr Murphy to remain as leader to ""finish the job of destroying Scottish Labour"".A Police Scotland spokeswoman said officers had been called and found two protestors on the third floor of the building. She added: ""Both left on police arrival. Advice and assistance was given."""
2015-04-25,Labour contenders clash on spending,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32761561,"Prospective Labour leaders have clashed over Labour's record in government in their first public debate in the race to succeed Ed Miliband.Former cabinet ministers including Yvette Cooper and Andy Burnham defended Labour's fiscal record and spending on schools and hospitals.However, candidates from the 2010 intake of MPs argued that the party spent too much while in office.The debate followed Chuka Umunna's withdrawal from the leadership contest.The remaining candidates appeared at the annual conference of the Progress think tank in London.There was agreement that Labour needed to demonstrate economic credibility to regain power, with shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt telling the meeting that the party needed to be ""trusted with public finances and the family finances"".Mr Hunt, who was first elected to Parliament in 2010 when Labour lost power, argued the last Labour government ""spent too much"" and failed to ""leave enough economic headroom to deal with the economic crisis and the recession"".Shadow health minister Liz Kendall said: ""There's absolutely nothing progressive about spending more on debt interest payments than on educating our children.""But shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: ""The Tories have had a triumph of spin over the facts in saying what they said about the economic record of the last Labour government.""The former chief secretary to the Treasury said the deficit did ""grow too large"" in the government's later years but insisted: ""The last Labour government ran more surpluses in its first term than the Tories did in 18 years.""Yvette Cooper, another former chief secretary to the Treasury, said: ""We should never let anybody tell us that it was too many teachers, doctors or nurses that caused Lehman Brothers bank in New York to crash.""Shadow international development secretary Mary Creagh said: ""People have forgotten the economic credibility that the last Labour government had.""She said Labour had built schools and hospitals that were ""treasured in our communities"".Ms Cooper, Mr Burnham, Ms Kendall and Ms Creagh have declared their intention to run for leader, while Mr Hunt told the conference he would make an announcement next week.At the same event, shadow energy secretary Caroline Flint announced she would be running for deputy leader.The Don Valley MP told the Today programme ahead of the debate that Labour lost the election because ""fundamentally the public did not trust us on the economy"".Exeter MP Ben Bradshaw has already announced a bid to be deputy, saying Labour ""must and could win the next election"", but only if it ""broadens its appeal by adopting sensible, centre-left politics which celebrate wealth creation and entrepreneurship"".Former Labour campaign co-ordinator Tom Watson is reported to be crowd-funding a deputy leadership bid, while Walthamstow MP Stella Creasy has said she is ""open to the question"" of running.Barnsley East MP and shadow transport secretary Michael Dugher - a fierce critic of Ed Miliband's election campaign - is to run Mr Burnham's campaign, according to the website LabourList.It is reported that Mr Burnham also has the backing of Labour peer Lord Falconer, who was lord chancellor and justice secretary under Tony Blair and was close to the former PM.Shadow culture secretary Chris Bryant has signalled his backing for Ms Cooper, tweeting that the next leader must be ""someone who's been tried in the fiery furnace of public opinion"".Mr Hunt said on Friday he would be be attending the debate - along with the other four hopefuls - to ""set out my analysis on how we begin to understand what went so wrong and why"".He added: ""We must use this leadership election to ask some very profound questions.""All voices in the party must be heard so that we can have a full and proper assessment as to why the politics of nationalism triumphed in Scotland and huge swathes of England, and how we have allowed the Conservative Party to present a more compelling vision for Britain to so many millions of people.""Speculation still surrounds shadow business secretary Mr Umunna's decision to pull out on Friday, when he said he was not ""comfortable"" with the ""pressure"" of being a candidate.As well as citing extensive pressure and scrutiny Mr Umunna also said he was ruling himself out because of concerns about the impact of the bid on his family.A rising star of the party, Mr Umunna was first elected to Parliament in 2010 - alongside Tristram Hunt and Liz Kendall - before joining the shadow cabinet.Asked about the candidate who might win, Conservative Chancellor George Osborne said: ""The Labour leadership contest has descended into farce.""But it's not actually about personalities. I don't think the Labour Party any more represents the working people of this country who aspire to a better life."""

I'm not suggesting he takes a break from being leader.""Clearly the national executive has the authority, they're the ruling body. ""I'm told that they made a decision. I'm told it was a procedurally correct decision, he is the leader but I think it's important that as leader he takes a break and I think it's important that we work out how these complex questions are answered by a team.""No one person has all the answers. I'm particularly concerned about tone, making sure we get a tone that ensures that the 27 million people who didn't vote for UKIP last week may be persuaded to vote for us in future.""The party has been beset by wrangling since Mr Farage agreed to stay on as leader, days after standing down after failing to get elected in Thanet South.He had pledged before the general election that he would quit the post if he failed to get elected to Parliament.Senior aide Matthew Richardson has left the party, following claims from MEP Patrick O'Flynn that Mr Farage had fallen under the influence of ""inexperienced"" advisers.UKIP has also confirmed the departure of Mr Farage's chief of staff Raheem Kassam.Mr Farage ruled out quitting as leader on BBC's Question Time on Thursday, saying he had ""phenomenal"" support, and has challenged his critics to decide whether they want to stay in the party.In his article, Mr Carswell had said that ""knowing how difficult it is to lead a party makes me admire Nigel Farage all the more"".""I know that I never could,"" he added, stressing that he would find it ""impossible to simultaneously lead UKIP, be the voice of the party in the Commons, represent my Clacton constituents and at the same time be a husband and a dad"".However, he said that ""even leaders need to take a break"", adding: ""Nigel needs to take a break now.""UKIP got nearly four million votes at the election, but returned only one MP - former Conservative Mr Carswell in the Clacton constituency."
2015-04-25,Coasting schools 'must improve',https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/education-32763097,"Education Secretary Nicky Morgan has said new powers to sack head teachers in coasting schools will show ""it is not OK to be just above the level of failing"". Under the plans, ministers could force schools rated as ""requiring improvement"" and missing new government benchmarks to become an academy.Coasting schools have average results which have often flatlined over time.Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, Mrs Morgan said faster action was needed.She said: ""Our big priorities will be to speed up the process for tackling failing schools; extend our academies programme to tackle 'coasting' schools; and deliver on our commitment to open new free schools.""The proposals will be in a new bill due to be introduced in the Queen's Speech. ""First, we will take new powers to step in from the moment that a school is found to be failing,"" Mrs Morgan said.""From day one, regional schools commissioners will be able to bring in new leadership and support from other excellent schools and heads, and we will speed up the process of turning schools into academies to make sure that new expert leadership is found for all schools that need it as quickly as possible.""She said that coasting schools will be put on an immediate notice to improve and could then be taken over and turned into an academy.They will be required to work with a team of ""expert"" head teachers.She said: ""Those that aren't able to demonstrate a clear plan for improvement will be given new leadership - we know this works in turning schools around.""More than 3,300 schools in England are labelled ""requires improvement"", but the plans are unlikely to cover that many schools.Under the current system, secondary schools are considered to be failing, and therefore eligible for intervention, if fewer than 40% of their students score at least five Cs at GCSE, including English and maths, and they do not meet national averages in pupil progress.In primary schools, the threshold for intervention is if fewer than 65% of pupils get Level 4 in reading, writing and maths and a below average number of pupils make the expected amount of progress.It is not yet clear how coasting schools will be deemed in need of intervention.It is understood that a new category will be devised covering schools which are rated as ""requires improvement"" and which fail to meet a new set of standards on improvement."
2015-04-25,Co-op Group to keep political funding,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-32762858,"The Co-operative Group has decided to continue financially supporting the Co-operative Party, which has strong ties to Labour.Members of the group, the UK's biggest mutual organisation, voted on the issue at their annual general meeting.They passed a motion by 48,579 for, to 39,479 against, to approve ""political expenditures"" of up to £1m which support the movement's objectives.Last year the Co-op Group gave £625,000 to the Co-op Party.This figure was down on the sums donated in previous years. The AGM also included a vote on new corporate governance procedures which would mean members having less of a direct say.The Co-operative Group is still recovering from a period of financial mismanagement and some members have recently expressed concerns about how elections to the board are chosen.The banking arm of the group came close to collapse in 2013, bringing the whole group to a £2.5bn annual loss that year. The Co-op Party includes among its members a number of Labour MPs, including shadow chancellor Chris Leslie and Walthamstow MP Stella Creasy. The politicians stand as candidates of both the Co-operative Party and the Labour Party, and the two political movements have strong historical ties. The board asked the members of the Co-operative Group whether they wanted to continue financially supporting the Co-operative Party, or any other party. Allan Leighton, chairman of the Co-op Group, said: ""There's a clear remit from the members to continue to support the Labour Party.""It allows us to now have a conversation with the Co-op Labour Party about what we do next.""There was also a members' motion on the agenda, put forward by those in favour of making political donations of up to £1m a year.The motion to approve political funding ""not to exceed £1m per annum"" was carried by 55.17% to 44.83%.BBC business correspondent Joe Lynam said: ""To meet a £1.5bn hole in its accounts - mostly stemming from its banking division - the Co-op Group has had to sell off parts of its businesses and hand over majority control of its bank to American hedge funds.""It's also in the process of radically changing the way it runs itself into a more corporate structure with less of a direct say by its members.""He said that ""in theory"", each of the 2.8 million Co-op members could vote on a series of motions about the reforms, as well as how its bosses are paid, and retaining the links to the Co-operative party.One of the group's largest independent societies, Midcounties, recently threatened legal action over a shortlist of six candidates for the group's board being reduced to three - the number of positions available - before a member vote.

2015-04-25,Osborne plans July 'stability' Budget,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32761566,"Chancellor George Osborne has said that he will deliver a new Budget on 8 July.He claimed it would have ""a laser-like focus"" on raising productivity and living standards.He said he was making the unusual move of having a second Budget in one year in order to ""deliver on the commitments we have made to working people"".Labour said the chancellor would have to set out ""who is going to pay"" for what it called ""uncosted promises"" in the election campaign.Speaking outside 11 Downing Street, the chancellor gave a broad outline of his plans for the forthcoming Budget but refused to be drawn on the details, including the Conservatives' planned £12bn of welfare cuts.""I don't want to wait to deliver on the commitments we have made to working people,"" he said.""It will continue with the balanced plan we have to deal with our debts, invest in our health service and reform welfare to make work pay.""But there will also be a laser-like focus on making our economy more productive so we raise living standards across our country.""We're going to put Britain into good shape for the long term.""The last Budget was held on 18 March and included tax cuts for first-time house buyers.Writing in the Sun, Mr Osborne admitted it was ""unusual"" to have two Budgets in the same year, but he wanted to turn ""promises made in the election into a reality"".Again, Mr Osborne did not specifically outline how the Conservatives plan to fulfil a pledge to cut £12bn in welfare spending but said he wants to make the welfare system ""fair for the people who pay for it"".He writes: ""We will protect the NHS and give it more funding each and every year, while making savings across Whitehall. ""We'll crack down hard on tax avoidance and aggressive tax planning by the rich - because everyone should pay their fair share.  ""We will always protect the most vulnerable, but we also need a welfare system that's fair to the people who pay for it. If you can work you should be working, so we'll take the next steps in our benefit reforms to make sure that happens.""Second, we've got to go on helping businesses create jobs in Britain, so we move towards full employment. That means facing a hard truth: in Britain we produce about a quarter less for every hour we work than countries like America or Germany. Fixing that long-running productivity weakness is the big challenge for the next five years.""So in the Budget we'll spend less on welfare, and instead invest to create three million more apprenticeships, so that young people can learn a trade, get better jobs and earn more.""After the Budget in March independent forecaster the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said that Mr Osborne needed to spell out exactly how he plans to cut £12bn from welfare spending.Of those £12bn planned cuts, £2bn were outlined ahead of the general election - all the cuts are supposed to be in place by 2017-18.Labour's shadow energy and climate change secretary, Caroline Flint, accused the Tories of making ""a number of uncosted promises"" during the election campaign.She told the BBC: ""It will be interesting to see who is going to pay for those uncosted policies when they bring the Budget in July."""
2015-04-25,Farage should take a break - Carswell,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32761766,"UKIP leader Nigel Farage ""needs to take a break now"", the party's only MP Douglas Carswell has said.Writing in the Times, Mr Carswell said he admired Mr Farage, but questioned his ""ill-advised"" comments about HIV patients, made in a TV leaders' debate.Mr Farage ruled out quitting as leader on BBC's Question Time on Thursday, saying he had ""phenomenal"" support.It follows a bitter internal row within the party, which has seen two of Mr Farage's senior aides resigning.In his article, Mr Carswell said that ""knowing how difficult it is to lead a party makes me admire Nigel Farage all the more"".""I know that I never could,"" he added, stressing that he would find it ""impossible to simultaneously lead UKIP, be the voice of the party in the Commons, represent my Clacton constituents and at the same time be a husband and a dad"".However, he said that ""even leaders need to take a break"", adding: ""Nigel needs to take a break now.""He described Mr Farage as ""inspirational"", saying the party had ""done extraordinarily well"" under his leadership but now needed to ""consider carefully what comes next"".Earlier, Mr Farage challenged his critics to decide whether they wanted him to stay in the party.He said he had ""massive"" support from UKIP MEPs, donors and party members to continue in the role, suggesting one person, whom he did not name, was ""agitating for change"".Addressing the prospect of a future EU referendum, Mr Carswell said: ""All of us UKIP supporters should ask one question; Is what I'm doing at this moment making an 'out' vote more likely? If it isn't, stop it and do something else.""He also criticised Mr Farage's comments about HIV patients during the TV leaders' debate last month.While debating about the NHS, Mr Farage said: ""You can come into Britain from anywhere in the world and get diagnosed with HIV and get the retro-viral drugs that cost up to £25,000 per year per patient.""Mr Carswell wrote: ""By all means we should highlight the problem of health tourism. But we need to admit that using the example of HIV patients to make the point was ill-advised.""He said the party needed to strike ""the right tone"" and added: ""UKIP has been at its most persuasive when we have been most optimistic.""Anger is never a great way to motivate people - at least not for very long.""The party has been beset by wrangling since Mr Farage agreed to stay on as leader, days after standing down after failing to get elected in Thanet South.He had pledged before the general election that he would quit the post if he failed to get elected to Parliament.Matthew Richardson has left the party, following claims from MEP Patrick O'Flynn that Mr Farage had fallen under the influence of ""inexperienced"" advisers. UKIP has also confirmed the departure of Mr Farage's chief of staff Raheem Kassam.UKIP got nearly four million votes at the election, but returned only one MP - former Conservative Mr Carswell in the Clacton constituency."
2015-04-25,Tributes as ex-Conservative MP dies,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-northamptonshire-32764540,"Tributes have been paid to former Conservative MP Sir Peter Fry who has died at the age of 83.Sir Peter, who had been ill for a year, was MP for Wellingborough and Rushden, in Northamptonshire, for 28 years from 1969 until his defeat by Labour in 1997.In government he was notable as an expert on transport issues.Current Wellingborough Conservative MP Peter Bone said Sir Peter remained ""extremely well thought of"".""When I was canvassing in the last election, people were still talking about him. They absolutely loved how he helped them and he was a highly-regarded local MP,"" Mr Bone said.""He stood up for what was right rather than what the party line was. In those days - the John Major years - it was much more difficult to stand up against the party machine. He had strong views on Europe.""Sir Peter started his career as an insurance broker, joining the Wycombe Young Conservatives in 1949 and the Oxford University Conservative Association in 1951.He went on to become a Conservative councillor on Buckinghamshire County Council between 1961 and 1967.Wellingborough mayor-elect Barry Graves also paid tribute to Sir Peter, remembering him as a ""very strong constituency MP"".""I remember going out and canvassing with him and he would go everywhere. He knew the area and the people. He was very much a man of the local constituency.""He was ""a very approachable man"", Mr Graves added.Sir Peter was knighted in 1994. "

2015-04-25,PM will 'look at' powers proposals,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32746049,"David Cameron has said he would ""look at"" any proposals for further powers for Scotland but wants to get the Smith Commission plans implemented first.The prime minister was speaking after meeting Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon in Edinburgh.Mr Cameron said he made a ""commitment"" to include a devolution bill in the Queen's Speech later this month.Ms Sturgeon argued the Smith Commission proposals were ""a good starting point"" but did not go far enough.The prime minister has pledged to include a bill on devolution in this month's Queen's Speech which would be based on the cross-party Smith Commission agreement. The Smith proposals included giving Holyrood the power to set income tax rates and bands, as well as control over a share of VAT and some welfare benefits. But Ms Sturgeon's SNP also wants the Scottish Parliament to be given powers over business taxes, employment law, the minimum wage and additional powers over welfare.Speaking after meeting Ms Sturgeon, Mr Cameron told the BBC: ""Let's make sure Smith is implemented in full. I'm going to keep the commitment I made to the people of Scotland. Let's get that done first because it does create a really strong Scottish Parliament.""He added: ""Of course, if people want to make future proposals I'll look at them.""The prime minister again said he did not support full fiscal autonomy for Scotland - the responsibility for all areas of tax and spending except defence and foreign affairs - stating that it would mean £7bn of cuts or extra tax-raising.What Nicola Sturgeon is trying to say is she has a mandate. She has 56 out of the 59 MPs elected in Scotland and she won 50% of the vote - unprecedented here in Scotland.She says that gives her leverage to push David Cameron. David Cameron says he wants to keep the nation together.The language coming out of Westminster last week was very much a cordial one. 'We will listen'.Nicola Sturgeon has warned him that if he doesn't listen, then the people of Scotland will judge him accordingly.Ms  Sturgeon described the hour-long talks at her official residence at Bute House as ""constructive and business-like"". She said Mr Cameron had made a ""commitment"" that the Smith proposals would be implemented ""as agreed"".""But secondly the prime minister agreed that he would look at proposals that we would now send to suggest the areas we can go beyond Smith,"" Ms Sturgeon said.""There was no agreement in terms of the substance of that but we will submit those proposals, the prime minister has said they will consider them and there will be a meeting to look at how we take that further forward.""Referring to her party's success in last week's general election, which saw the SNP win 56 out of 59 Scottish seats, Ms Sturgeon said: ""People in Scotland have now voted fairly convincingly for the SNP and sent a message that we want the Smith Commission proposals to go further and be built on.""The ball is in his court but I'm going into this in good faith.""She added: ""David Cameron and I are a world apart politically but, where we can, I'm determined to do business in the interests of the people of Scotland and across the UK.""She said she would have a ""constructive and business-like"" relationship with the prime minister. The two leaders shook hands on the front steps of Bute House as Mr Cameron arrived. Mr Cameron left the building shortly before 11:00, almost an hour after he had arrived.The two sides agreed to hold more regular discussions in the future, possibly quarterly. "
2015-04-25,Umunna withdraws Labour leader bid,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32748106,"Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna has withdrawn from the Labour party leadership contest, just days after throwing his hat into the ring.The MP, 36, said in a statement that he was not comfortable with the level of pressure and scrutiny that came with being a leadership candidate.Mr Umunna also cited concerns about the impact of the bid on his family.BBC political editor Nick Robinson said the MP's team insisted no ""unwelcome press story"" lay behind the move.But Mr Umunna had been shocked by the level of scrutiny of himself, his mother, sister and girlfriend, he said.You can follow the latest reaction here.A rising star of the party, Mr Umunna was first elected to Parliament in 2010 before joining the shadow cabinet.He confirmed his candidacy for the Labour leadership via a post on his Facebook page on 12 May, saying the party under Ed Miliband had failed to appeal to enough voters in England.But on Friday he said he had not found the leadership bid to be ""a comfortable experience"".I understand that Chuka Umunna has told friends that ""this is not right for me or people close to me. I'm human, the rest of my life is more important to me than politics.""The shadow business secretary has been distressed by the degree of scrutiny he, his family and his girlfriend have come under since he declared his intention to stand for the labour leadership.I am told that this includes reporters waiting outside the houses of relatives late at night.Friends of Mr Umunna deny that he is nervous of not getting the support of enough MPs to run for the leadership; they point out that he already has half the necessary names and that there are some weeks to go.The shadow business secretary now wants to play a leading role in arguing that Britain should stay in the EU and does not rule out seeking the leadership in the future.He said he thought he had understood ""the scrutiny and attention a leadership contest would bring"", but added: ""However, since the night of our defeat last week I have been subject to the added level of pressure that comes with being a leadership candidate.""The shadow business secretary said he had wondered if it was too soon for him to stand for the leadership, and ""I fear it was."" He also cited concerns about the impact on ""the rest of one's life"" and those close to him.""Consequently, after further reflection, I am withdrawing my candidacy,"" he said.Mr Umunna said he would continue to serve as shadow business secretary and hoped to ""play a leading role"" in Labour's campaign to keep the UK in the EU during the forthcoming in/out referendum.Commenting on the news, Labour former culture secretary Ben Bradshaw - who is expected to run for deputy leader - said Mr Umunna was a ""terrible loss"" to the field.He told the BBC's Daily Politics the Streatham MP had been the candidate the Conservative Party ""feared the most"".""And if it's the result of pressure on an extended family or an extended group of friends, I think that's a very sad reflection on our political culture,"" he said.Chuka Umunna feels ""liberated"", he told me, by his decision to quit the Labour leadership race.He hopes to be given a good role (shadow chancellor, I wonder?) by whoever becomes Labour leader. And I expect he'll become very high profile in the campaign to keep Britain in Europe, which is increasingly looking like it will be next May.He'll endorse a candidate in the next four weeks before nominations close. It will be very interesting to see who he piles in behind.Read more from Allegra (see post 13.23).Former Labour leader Lord Kinnock said he thought Mr Umunna had made the right decision.He said: ""If he felt in his soul that he wasn't prepared to subject himself - and more importantly his family - to the kind of attention which is fairly typical, sadly, these days, he has done absolutely the right thing.""There is no point at all in inflicting avoidable, unnecessary misery on those you love most.""Leadership contender Mary Creagh said she had ""huge respect"" for Mr Umunna, telling BBC Radio 4's World at One programme it took ""courage"" to withdraw from the leadership race.Mr Umunna was ""a big beast"" and would play a ""big role"" in the future of the Labour Party, she added.Yvette Cooper, Andy Burnham, Liz Kendall and Mary Creagh have already thrown their hats into the ring for Labour's top job while a number of other potential candidates, including Dan Jarvis, Alan Johnson and David Lammy, have ruled themselves out. Candidates must secure nominations from 34 colleagues - 15% of the party's MPs - by 15 June to make it on to ballot papers, which will be sent to members in August ahead of the leader's election a month later."

However, Mr Justice Stuart Smith at Southwark Crown Court said there was a ""very strong likelihood"" a custodial sentence would follow.The jury heard how Mote submitted numerous false expenses claims for payment for work that organisations had allegedly carried out on his behalf.Mote claimed the money was to pay whistleblowers in cash through third parties. He also said he had been ""targeted for being an anti-EU MEP.""During his time an MEP he also made £250,000 legitimate expenses claims.No date has been set for the sentencing."

2015-04-25,Round-up: BBC experts' analysis,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/election-2015-32650417,"The political future of the United Kingdom has become clearer after the results of the general election emerged around the country.David Cameron says he hopes to govern for all of the UK after the Conservatives took 331 seats - enough to form a slender majority in the Commons.Labour has been all but wiped out by the SNP in Scotland and suffered a disappointing set of results elsewhere, while the Lib Dems are left with just eight MPs after many party heavyweights such as Vince Cable and Danny Alexander lost their seats.So with battles won and lost and the fall-out and celebrations beginning, BBC correspondents examine the implications and challenges that lie ahead for the new government - and for those whose political careers have been ended by voters.No pollster, no pundit, no political leader saw it coming - not even David Cameron himself.Governing parties don't gain seats. Parties that have implemented painful cuts and are promising more certainly don't. Until that is the Conservative Party did - achieving what had seemed to be Mission Impossible - a Tory majority.Until that is David Cameron's personal triumph which triggered the near simultaneous resignation of his three principle opponents - Messrs Miliband, Clegg and Farage.They did so in part because they helped to crush their partners in coalition these last five years - reducing the Liberal Democrat parliamentary party to a size when it can fit into two London taxis and still have two seats to spare.In part because the extraordinary tidal wave of support for the SNP swept dozens of once safe Labour seats away.In part because Nigel Farage persuaded millions to vote for him but secured just one seat - not, though, the one he was standing in.Read more from Nick Robinson hereThe question uppermost in the prime minister's mind as he assembles his new government is how to keep the kingdom united.""Above all I want to bring our country together,"" he revealed after the result, ""to reclaim a mantle we should never have lost - the mantle of one nation, one United Kingdom"".Looking at the political landscape from Land's End today is very different to the view from John O'Groats.A sea of Conservative and Unionist blue dominates the scene across much of England, while a field of SNP nationalist yellow stretches to the horizon and beyond from the north.David Cameron's greatest challenge is to prevent the union he supports being torn apart by mutual resentment - resentment from Scotland at a Westminster government dominated by English Tories, and resentment from England at the preferential treatment people think is being given to the Scots.Those who assumed the future of the Union had been safeguarded by the Scottish referendum must think again.Read more from Mark Easton hereOne thing is rock-solid true: the Conservatives who worked on this campaign are as surprised by the result as the pollsters, pundits, politicians and general population.Maybe they shouldn't be - the economy is in good shape and the Conservatives had incumbency advantage.But when I travelled back from the prime minister's last rally with a group of exhausted Conservative campaign officials it was clear that 290 seats was a hoped-for target.No-one talked about anything over 300 seats, and no-one even mentioned an overall majority.So what special sauce pushed David Cameron into No 10 with a Commons majority?Mr Cameron had two simple messages in the campaign and he rarely veered away from them; the first - the economy is in good shape and the recovery is threatened by Labour. And the second - the SNP would hold a Labour-led government to ransom.Read more from Jonny Dymond hereBrian Taylor, BBC political editor, ScotlandOf all the comments on the overnight apocalypse, undoubtedly the most straightforward came from a defeated Scottish Labour MP.Since there were quite a few of them, let me narrow the focus a little. Come on down, Tom Harris.Mr Harris had plainly anticipated defeat. Nonetheless, he looked suitably lugubrious as his fate was confirmed.Why, he was asked eagerly, had Labour lost? ""Because we did not win enough votes.""Psephologically, it is perfect. Complete in itself. Psychologically, it sums up Labour's gloom without descending into subsidiary matters such as leadership, strategy and the rest. As a forward-thinking strategy, it is ideal. Win more votes. Simple.Read more from Brian Taylor hereThis has been an election which may have more profound consequences than almost any in living memory.We now face a generational decision about our future in Europe, with an EU referendum in two years' time almost certain.There will also be serious questions about the future of the Union, following an SNP landslide that has turned Scotland into a virtual one-party state.David Cameron's victory also represents a colossal achievement.Only once before in recent history has an incumbent government increased its majority - and that was Mrs Thatcher in her prime in the 1980s.It is also a significant personal victory for Mr Cameron and a rebuff for those in his party who had become increasingly sceptical about his ability to win.But while it may represent a defeat for those Tories who saw this election as a potential opportunity to rid themselves of David Cameron, he must now govern with a wafer-thin majority.For the SNP, their stunning victory can only increase the pressure on Nicola Sturgeon to include a commitment to a second independence referendum in her party's manifesto for next year's Scottish elections.It is an election which has not just defied all the predictions of the pollsters and pundits - but which may yet prompt the most fundamental re-casting of British politics for a generation.Read more from Norman Smith hereAfter an extraordinary night, some brief conclusions:Read more from James Landale hereIs this the end of the union?That is the question many people will be asking this morning after the party which has fought for Scottish independence for 80 years swept to victory.The answer from the jubilant Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon is a firm ""No"".She insists that her MPs will speak for all of Scotland, not just for the 45% who voted for the country to leave the United Kingdom last September.In the closing hours of the most extraordinary election campaign which anyone in Scotland can remember, Ms Sturgeon turned to talk of ""legitimacy.""That will be her watchword in the coming days as she argues that the prime minister cannot ignore the democratic will of the Scottish people.Politically, Scotland and England this morning look and feel like very different countries.Read more from James Cook hereAfter weeks of chatter about an election too close to call, it wasn't that close at all.David Cameron will be continuing as our prime minister.So, what is all this likely to mean?A referendum on whether the UK stays in, or leaves, the European Union, within the next two-and-a-half years.A race to be the next leader of the Labour Party.A race to be the next leader of the Liberal Democrats.And a huge new presence of Scottish National Party MPs at Westminster.And so here's another thing we know for certain this morning: Politics ain't going to be boring any time soon.Read more from Chris Mason hereFor Labour the story of their terrible night is rapidly turning into the search for a new leader. So who will that be?Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, is almost certain to run.  Even before this election, both he and another almost inevitable candidate, Chuka Umunna, had raised eyebrows inside the party at the work they had put in, preparing the ground with members and the unions for potential bids.Yvette Cooper, before the election, was still thought not to have made up her mind over whether to run. That decision has been made perhaps a little easier as her husband, Ed Balls, has lost his seat.She is certainly potentially in the frame, along with two lesser known names - Liz Kendall and Dan Jarvis - two MPs who were only elected in 2010 for the first time. This could be their moment. But whoever is in the job, they face a monumental task.Read Laura Kuenssberg's Twitter hereSterling is up (the most for seven years against the euro), share prices are up (especially bank shares like Lloyds and RBS, and energy shares such as Centrica), government bond prices are up.To state the obvious, investors love the Tories' general election victory.There are a few reasons.One (no surprise here) is that Labour's threat of breaking up banks and imposing energy price caps has been lifted.Second is that investors have been discounting days and weeks of wrangling after polling day over who would form the government - and so they are semi-euphoric that we already know who's in charge.Third, many investors tend to be economically conservative and instinctively Conservative.But although the City may be a bit drunk on the result, its pleasure in Ed Miliband's and Ed Balls' humiliation may be making it a bit blind - perhaps dangerously so - to some bumps in the economic road ahead.Read more from Robert Peston hereNigel Farage dreamed of holding the balance of power, but in the end his UKIP party is now worse off than when it came into the election.At the seventh time of asking he was rejected - this time by the people of Thanet South. It was a similar story in Rochester and Strood where Mark Reckless, who sensationally defected from the Tories last year, was also sent packing.In seats on UKIP's target list, like Thurrock in Essex, the party failed to make gains. In Grimsby - where Mr Farage went twice in the last six weeks - they came third.UKIP got around four million votes - with especially strong showings in north-east and south-east England - but it's ended up with just one MP, and a vacancy at the top. This has led to UKIP attacking the current system of choosing MPs, which it's described as ""busted"" and ""dysfunctional"".In one sense, this campaign was a complete failure and it's left an aftermath of angry voters, and others wondering if the UKIP bubble has burst.Read Robin Brant's Twitter hereI monitored 91 GB-wide voting intention polls during the 2015 election campaign and found nothing in them to prepare me for the final outcome.The good news for the pollsters was that their share for the Lib Dems was pretty close, as were the shares for UKIP, the Greens and the catch-all category of Others.The bad news for the polling industry was that the crucial shares for Conservative and Labour were the ones where they came most adrift.When all the qualifications of margins of error are allowed, there did appear to be a systematic overstatement of the Labour share and an equally systematic understatement of the Conservative one.It is for the pollsters to decide whether to conduct a review of their performance but I trust they will avoid the initial knee-jerk reaction of the immediate aftermath of the 1992 polls debacle.This general election performance follows the performance of the polls in the 2014 Scottish referendum where the choice was simply binary and yet all the polls were out by between 4-6%.Something is wrong. A lot of us would like to know what it is.Read more from David Cowling hereThe words ""political earthquake"" have been translated into numerous European languages, making front page news across the continent.While Britons now examine the domestic minutiae of the election result, here in mainland Europe the vote means one thing: a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU. And that has the potential to create an earthquake of its own.The guardian of the EU treaties Mr Cameron wants to change - Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker - has said again he'd listen to what Britain's new government proposed.Read more from Katya Adler here"

2015-04-25,A history of political plots,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32749971,"Nigel Farage has apparently seen off a challenge to his leadership of UKIP - a move described by his former election strategist as a ""coup"". He's not the only party leader to face an attempted ousting. But can you recover from such a revolt?In 2006, the Labour prime minister was the target of what became known as the ""curry house conspiracy"" - a coup to remove him and install his chancellor, Gordon Brown, as prime minister.It would lead to several of the plotters' resignations - but not Mr Blair's. However, it was successful to a degree in that it forced the party leader into naming a departure date.The move against him was reportedly masterminded by Tom Watson, a defence minister at the time, who was also rumoured to have had a secret meeting with Mr Brown on the eve of the revolt.Apparently, Mr Watson and three fellow West Midlands MPs - Sion Simon, David Wright (both ministerial aides) and Khalid Mahmood - met over a biryani at a Wolverhampton curry house to discuss the PM's future, before dispatching a missive calling for him to quit.The letter - which attracted the support of a number of normally loyal Labour MPs - was leaked to the press, and ultimately resulted in Mr Watson's resignation.In his parting letter, the West Bromwich East MP took a shot at the prime minister, who he said should step down in the interests of party and country.Mr Blair denounced his actions and branded the former minister ""disloyal, discourteous and wrong"", saying he would have sacked him if he had not resigned.But Mr Watson's departure was swiftly followed by the resignations of six other junior members of government - who had also signed the rebel letter - in protest at the prime minister's refusal to say when he would step down as Labour leader.The whole affair resulted in Mr Blair announcing his intention to step aside within 12 months - which he duly did, on 27 June 2007.But it did nothing to quash internal dissent and speculation in the party over the future leadership of the party.Labour prime minister Gordon Brown found his leadership under threat in 2009 after one of his cabinet ministers dramatically quit the government and called for him to resign.Work and Pensions Secretary James Purnell - a former aide to Tony Blair - resigned from his post after the polls closed in the local and European elections, in which Labour was forecast to do badly.Explaining his decision to quit, Mr Purnell said the prime minister made a Conservative victory ""more, not less, likely"".It was Mr Brown's first direct challenge from a cabinet minister - but it would not topple the Labour leader as senior members of government refused to follow Mr Purnell's lead.Mr Brown was safe for the time being. But several months later, in January 2010, a fresh leadership challenge was mounted by two senior former Labour cabinet ministers.Geoff Hoon and Patricia Hewitt wrote to all Labour MPs, saying the party was ""deeply divided"" over Mr Brown's leadership and that the best way to resolve the issue was by way of secret ballot.They insisted it was not an ""attempted coup"" but a necessary step to resolve divisions within the party.But the duo could only muster the public support of a handful of backbenchers long-opposed to Mr Brown, with the majority of the party's MPs less than impressed by the move, which came just weeks before the general election.As the day wore on, a succession of cabinet ministers came out to back the PM, suggesting there was little momentum behind the plot - although it was noted that several were not exactly gushing in their support of Mr Brown.As history tells us, neither leadership challenge bore fruit but they reflected the internal doubts and divisions over Mr Brown at the helm.As leadership toppling attempts go, this one in 2014 was regarded as a particularly ""botched"" and ""shambolic coup"". Indeed, former Lib Dem leader Lord (Paddy) Ashdown described the move as a ""plot of deep malice"".Its instigator, Lord (Matthew) Oakeshott - a close ally of the-then Business Secretary Vince Cable - tried to unseat Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg.The peer was found to have commissioned secret polls suggesting the party would do better at the 2015 general election without Mr Clegg in the driving seat.The man Lord Oakeshott had long had in mind to take Mr Clegg's place - Mr Cable, who was on government business in China at the time - was forced to publicly condemn his friend's actions and state his backing for Mr Clegg.But Lord Oakeshott said the business secretary had in fact known about his polls and their findings.Nevertheless, the peer - who was denounced by the Lib Dem leadership for spending money that could have been spent on campaigning - quit the party, and issued a warning shot on his way out about the Lib Dems' future prospects.Mr Cable largely emerged unscathed but he faced questions about his loyalty to the leader. Although the two sought to put paid to reports of a rift with a (painfully awkward, 'nothing to see here, folks') stage-managed pint in a pub.Although the revolt failed, and Mr Clegg remained at the helm, the Lib Dems did go on to suffer a trouncing at the general election, losing nearly 50 of its MPs - one of them, Mr Cable himself - prompting his leader to quit.The Conservatives have a reputation for being more ruthless than their party rivals when it comes to getting rid of leaders they sense are no longer effectual.But, in 1995, Prime Minister John Major - tired of persistent rumours of a leadership challenge - decided to take the bull by the horns and trigger a surprise leadership election to silence his detractors.His own backbenchers had questioned Mr Major's ability to unite and lead the party, which was deeply divided over Europe.So ""put up or shut up"", he told them as he tendered his resignation as Conservative Party leader but not prime minister.But then stepped forward eurosceptic MP John Redwood, who resigned from the cabinet in order to contest Mr Major's leadership.This was unexpected by many, as the PM had said there had been assurances from his cabinet that none would stand against him.But Mr Major went on to win the ensuing election with a comfortable defeat over his challenger, who was not included in the PM's consequent cabinet reshuffle.No further contested leadership election took place until after the Conservatives' defeat at the 1997 general election, paving the way for William Hague to take over the running of the party.Not all attempts to oust a party leader end in failure: as Margaret Thatcher found out to her peril.With three electoral victories under her belt, the Conservative prime minister's downfall would come at the hands of her own party - not the voters.It was on 1 November 1990 when Geoffrey (now Lord) Howe - one of Mrs Thatcher's longest-serving ministers - resigned over differences with the party leader over Europe.In his now infamous speech on the floor of the House of Commons, he attacked the PM's policies and leadership style, comparing being one of her cabinet ministers to opening the batting at cricket only to find his bat had been ""broken... by the team captain"".It sparked the beginning of the end of the 11-year Thatcher reign.Michael (now Lord) Heseltine seized on the opportunity to challenge the prime minister in the ensuing leadership contest, from which she would eventually withdraw and John Major emerge as her successor. Reflecting on the revolt and its implications on the Conservative Party, Baroness Thatcher's biographer Charles Moore wrote: ""Because the coup was unjustified, and so trust broke down, the politics of the next 15 years were those of civil war."""
2015-04-25,Election swings and roundabouts,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-32741924,"If election manifesto claims are all about smoke and mirrors, should we now add swings and roundabouts to the political metaphor?There's an intriguing aspect to the general election results in the Midlands that puzzled me.It's the striking contrast in the swings between Labour and the Conservatives.David Cameron and his campaign strategists knew they were home and dry when Nuneaton was the first Midlands marginal to declare.It was not only a Tory hold but a swing to the Conservatives from Labour of 3%.I was in the Nottingham suburb of Beeston awaiting the result of the Broxtowe count. Would its high profile Conservative MP Anna Soubry survive a red surge?Nuneaton set the pattern. Across the Midlands, both east and west, there was a uniform swing of between three and four per cent to the Tories - Warwickshire North 3%, Amber Valley 4%, Derbyshire South 4% and Sherwood 4%. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan topped the Tory swingometer in the Midlands marginals with 5% in Loughborough.Yet in the big cities, it was a very different story. The swing went to Labour.So in Nottingham East they enjoyed a 6% swing, Nottingham South 5.8%, Leicester South 7.3%, Leicester West 5%, Birmingham Hall Green 12%, Birmingham Hodge Hill 8%.If swings to Labour on this scale had gone beyond the city ring road roundabouts and into the suburbs, Ed Miliband would have become prime minister by now.In confidence, one senior Labour insider in Nottingham told me its success in the city wards was down to organisation, experience and its teams of activists.""We won the ground war. If Nottingham's city boundaries were extended into Sherwood and Broxtowe, we would have won those constituencies as well,"" he told me.Labour leadership candidate, Leicester West's Liz Kendall has identified her party's problem beyond the ring road roundabout.It's about reaching out to Middle England.""We need to show people that we understand their aspirations and ambitions for the future,"" she told the Sunday Times.The problem for Labour was that Middle England was not interested in what the party offered…and still isn't. The Cameron brand worked its magic in those Midlands marginals... it'll take something or someone special to break up that ballot box relationship."
2015-04-25,Royal 'lobbying',https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32740154,"Prince Charles sent 27 letters to then Prime Minister Tony Blair and members of his government between September 2004 and March 2005, ""despite the Freedom of Information Act!"" as the prince joked in one.But did his suggestions and concerns have any bearing on the behaviour of Mr Blair's government?The request: Prince Charles expresses his worries over an EU directive on complementary medicines ""which is… effectively outlawing the use of certain herbal extracts"".  Mr Blair replied, offering moral support and practical help. He agreed that ""the implementation as it is currently planned is crazy"" and set out an action plan that included delaying implementation for all existing products to 2011. What happened: Herbal products were not required to be authorised until 2011, just as Mr Blair had promised. Prince Charles continues to sell his own brand of complementary products, Duchy Herbals, through Boots and Waitrose. The request: Writing to Mr Blair, the prince expresses a ""growing sense of anxiety"" that the Hill Farming Allowance, which supports farmers working on Britain's uplands, could be scrapped. In his reply, the prime minister said he understood that the Hill Farm Allowance would continue until 2007. What happened: The allowance lasted until the end of Labour's tenure in 2010, when it was abolished.The request: Just 18 months after the US-led invasion of Iraq, Prince Charles raised the issue of poor performance of Lynx helicopters in high temperatures, saying: ""I fear that this is just one more example of where our Armed Forces are being asked to do an extremely challenging job (particularly in Iraq) without the necessary resources.""Mr Blair replied: ""On the subject of the Lynx helicopter, the limitations of the existing platform, particularly in the extremely challenging environment within Iraq, are well recognised by the Ministry of Defence."" He added that replacement of the helicopters would be a priority. What happened: Mr Blair's comments go much further than what he was saying about the subject at the time. In the event, though, the fleet was not fully upgraded until 2011.The request: Prince Charles lamented that the government's TB prevention plans might not ""include a commitment to deal with the badger problem in the immediate future"" and pushed strongly for a cull, saying: ""All I can say is that I do urge you to look again at introducing a proper cull of badgers where it is necessary.""Mr Blair sympathised, saying he could ""personally see the case for culling badgers"". However, he was unwilling to commit to a cull.  What happened: Culling trials were conducted from 1998-2005. The final results, published in 2008, said that the badger cull could ""make no meaningful contribution"" to curbing bovine TB. It wasn't until 2013 that a full culling programme began in two pilot areas. These ended with the conclusion that the pilots had been neither humane nor effective at curbing the spread of TB.The request: Then Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell wrote to Prince Charles to say she had decided to give parts of the historic Smithfield meat market Grade II listed status, and was trying to persuade deputy prime minister John Prescott to ""call in"" the planning application to prevent demolition of other parts of the site. She had been swayed by evidence provided by Sir Neil Cossons, who was English Heritage chair at the time, after he had been asked by the prince to add his support. Prince Charles replied that he was ""extremely glad to read of your appreciation of the value of this group of buildings"". According to the Guardian, market workers desperate to see the redevelopment of the site invited the prince to meet them to discuss it, but his office said he was ""unlikely to accept as he did not want to interfere in the planning process"".What happened: Smithfield market is still the subject of planning battles a decade on. Successive planning applications have been refused by ministers. Last year then Communities Secretary Eric Pickles rejected plans for an office development on the site, stating that ""the extent of damage that the application would cause to the important heritage assets at Smithfield runs entirely counter to national and policy objectives intended to protect such assets from harm"".In March, the Museum of London announced a move from its current Barbican site to the Smithfield market building."
2015-04-25,Election fallout,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32703139,"""Some of those gimmicks - that tombstone, whatever idiot thought that up I do not know!""I was talking to the former Mayor of Crawley in Sussex, John Mortimer, in the town's Labour Supporters Club about the vexed question of what went wrong, and where Labour should go next. This seat is one of those southern seats Labour hoped to take, but failed.I hear a whole range of views in the club.""They didn't give nothing to depend on, they should be clear, and a little bit more down to Earth."" ""Good party, wrong leader, they don't look after business enough.""Councillor John Stanley tells me: ""I think in a way we did go too left, but now we can go a bit centre-left, or centre, depending who the new leader is.""The former mayor sums up the mood on the doorstep: ""Whatever we told them, they didn't believe us.""  Expect to hear all those views, and more, in the coming leadership contest. Step back from the angst of supporters, and it may not be that hard to see why Labour failed.  An economic recovery, hailed by independent organisations as the result of government policy, undid a party that had loudly proclaimed for five years that the coalition's policies would lead to economic disaster. Combine that with an uncharismatic and uninspirational leader, then you might argue no further debate is necessary.Fat chance of that. Defeat breeds resentment, and this one has opened up old divisions.  A chorus of Blairties, led by the man himself, has declared that Ed's problem was ignoring those with aspiration and ambition, failing to appeal to those running business. Incidentally, I've been ticked off by the perspicacious editor of the New Statesman, Jason Cowley, for using the ""unhelpful"" term ""Blairites"".I can't think of another description that fits Tony, Lord Mandelson, Lord Adonis and David Miliband quite so well. But call them what you will, the message was clear - Ed was too left wing, Labour should move back to the centre, or, if you like, to the right.Reading Mr Blair's pithy analysis, listening to Lord Mandelson's gripping and savage eloquence, describing a party sent out to shout: ""We love the poor and hate the rich,"" and so ignoring the middle, and you realise strong emotions are in play.But back to the future may not be sufficient. Of course elections are won on the centre ground. But grandees grinding axes, affronted by the failure of boys who used to make their tea, may be creating so much noise that they can't hear more insistent sounds.  For there are several elephants trumpeting loudly as they cram into the small space of the shadow cabinet room. Imagine these beasts are as gaily decorated as Berlin buddy bears. One is decked out in red, another in imperial purple bunting, and another, a mammoth, strong tusked and ice rimmed, painted yellow with tartan trimmings.Take the last first. The Scottish wipeout is Labour's biggest problem. Fail to solve it, and Labour can forget ever having a comfortable majority again. It is hard to argue Labour were wiped out in Scotland because the SNP outflanked them to the right with their appeal to the business community and the ambitious and aspirational. But it is true the SNP drew in to people from left, right and centre, just as the modernisers say Labour should. It was the politics of economic self-interest, but cast in a very different light. Tribally sneering at ""the reactionary ideology of nationalism"" as Mr Blair does, will not reach the central belt of Scotland, the middle ground of  Midlothian.What about that purple pachyderm?  In Crawley - in fact in seat after seat - there is a similar pattern.  Labour did, in fact, often increase the size of their vote. So did the Conservatives, usually by a bit more. But the real dynamic was the total collapse of the Lib Dems and the dramatic rise of UKIP. The increase in votes for Nigel Farage's party wasn't translated into parliamentary seats, but, although it is early days in terms of research, it probably hurt Labour a lot. If we believe - and I do - Matthew Goodwin and Rob Ford, authors of Revolt on the Right, these voters are often former Labour supporters - older, less educated, those left behind on the tides of  globalisation, stranded on the shores of post-industrialisation. They may have had too many disappointments to feel much ambition or aspiration. They are a challenge for Labour, and any new leader will spend a good deal of time thinking how to deal with the concerns of Europe and immigration.Whether to share their fears, or confront them will be a big decision.Which brings us to Red Nellie. Those members who still proudly call themselves socialist. This is not about Old Labour - they are more likely to be baristas or barristers than boilermakers. It is easy as an outsider, as a journalist, to treat politics as an intellectual game about how best to win power - but many people, particularly the foot soldiers, particularly after the death of  purely tribal loyalties, are in it because they passionately believe in winning  power to do something specific.Many of them are suspicious of the later incarnations of New Labour, not because it reached an accommodation with wealth and business, but because it seemed to worship at the same altar, to regard the party's core beliefs in redistribution and equality as childish fantasies from a past age.Perhaps to Mr Blair, they are the problem, people who may equate ""ambition"" with greed. They might point out that a man who claims to be worth ""only"" £20m may find it harder than most to squeeze through the eye of a needle to understand their point of view. Most successful Labour leaders will confront the left at some point, but the concerns of this group go to the existential question ""What is the party for?""This is not a polemic - not an argument about what should be done, but a reflection on the complex conundrums that will face any new Labour leader, the tearing apart of the old alliance that made up a Labour majority, and so the political need to satisfy groups with very different, indeed, contradictory demands. But looking for a Social Democratic universal theory of everything may be missing the point. What the party desperately wants is a leader who can pull the disparate threads together and articulate them as common purpose. Whether she or he exists is another matter.Much more on that in the coming months."
2015-04-25,'Take us with you',https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-32736153,"Thousands of people in the north of England have been using the hashtag ""take us with you Scotland"" to express their upset about the result of last week's general election, and Scottish nationalists are welcoming this English minority with open arms. Last Thursday's general election was a rough one for the Labour Party in its traditional stronghold in the north of England. But further to the north, the left-leaning Scottish National Party won nearly every seat it contested. That political contrast has made some left-wing voters in places like Manchester, Leeds and Sheffield look fondly on their neighbours. Since last Thursday's election in Britain the phrase ""take us with you Scotland"" has been used more than 24,000 times. ""Genuinely beginning to wonder if the North of England becoming a part of Scotland would be better for us, I really am,"" tweeted Aaron Miller from Yorkshire. Some cracked jokes under the tag after the North West Motorway Police account, which gives traffic updates, announced that they had ""picked up a pedestrian on the M62 who was trying to walk to Scotland.""After an initial spike of jokes over the weekend, the hashtag really took off when users start to mobilise in support of around a year-old petition on the campaigning site Change.org. The petition calls for the north of England to secede from the rest of the country and join up with Scotland, and more than 12,000 people have signed it.Its creator, a Sheffield resident who calls himself ""Stu Dent"", set it up to coincide with last year's Scottish independence referendum, and he also created a map imagining the boundary of a ""Scotland plus the north"" country.Stu Dent runs the Twitter account Hunters Bar, named after an area of southwest Sheffield which is very popular with - you guessed it - students. Despite the account having thousands of followers on Twitter, when the map was first posted last year, the image was shared only about 100 times - however, in the past week it's been retweeted by thousands. Stu Dent told BBC Trending that he was surprised at how popular his idea has become. ""In hindsight, perhaps I shouldn't have been,"" he said. ""There is a huge frustration in parts of the UK about the things that have happened since 2010.""""I think people need a place to go where they can say 'not in my name! This is not the England I want',"" he added. But in addition to disappointment from some quarters about the election result, there might be another reason why the petition is getting a boost now: the power of the Scottish Nationalists on Twitter. What started as a post-election joke in the North of England was quickly embraced by the so-called ""Cyber Nats"" - and a trend was born.The SNP's social media strategist Ross Colquhoun expressed the party's mood about the hashtag best, in a post which was shared more than 500 times. ""2014: #LetsStayTogether 2015: #TakeUsWithYouScotland What a difference a year makes"" he tweeted.Blog by Hannah HendersonNext story: The sport reporter and the obscene ranter who lost his jobFollow BBC Trending on Twitter @BBCtrending, and find us on Facebook."
2015-04-25,What Britain wants from Europe,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32695399,"David Cameron says he has a mandate to pursue EU reform following the Conservatives' general election victory. The PM, who will be hoping his majority government will give him extra leverage in Brussels, wants to renegotiate the terms of the UK's membership ahead of a referendum by the end of 2017. He has said he will campaign for Britain to remain in the EU if he gets the reforms he wants.Mr Cameron has said he does not want to reveal full details of his negotiating hand but he has given a broad indication, in a series of speeches and newspaper articles, of his priorities when he goes into talks with other EU leaders.These are: The prime minister has said Britain would resist any move towards a European Army and that he wants to free British police forces from EU interference. He has also ruled out Britain joining the euro.But he has placed less emphasis in recent years on demanding changes to EU social policy, such as the maximum 48-hour working week, agency workers, maternity leave and non-discrimination rules.The official UK government position is that a referendum will be held by the end of 2017 but Downing Street sources have said: ""If we can do it earlier we will.""There is speculation David Cameron is planning to hold the vote in 2016 to avoid a clash with French and German elections in 2017.The prime minister wants treaty change but even if the referendum was held in 2017 there may not be enough time to legally incorporate any reforms into a treaty and it would have to be done at a later stage.An early referendum would anger Eurosceptics who believe it would not allow enough time to make the case for exit or negotiate any meaningful concessions.""A rushed process would severely undermine the chances to secure a significant deal that both British business and voters could support and would waste the opportunity of a lifetime,"" Matthew Elliott, chief executive of Business for Britain told Breitbart London.The question is always crucial in any referendum and there is already a debate about what it should be. The Draft European Union (Referendum) Bill, published by the Conservatives in 2013, proposed this form of words: ""Do you think that the United Kingdom should remain a member of the European Union?""Some thought that leaned too far towards the status quo, encouraging a yes vote, and the Electoral Commission said it was not clear and direct enough. The watchdog proposed this form of words instead: ""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union?""The new Conservative government will attempt to repeal the Human Rights Act, which requires UK courts to treat the European Court of Human Rights as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. The European Court of Human Rights is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe (CoE), which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine.The freedom for people to move around Europe, enshrined in the EU treaties, works in parallel with the other three basic freedoms in the single market: freedom of goods, capital and services.It is likely to be a ""red line"" for other EU leaders, who do not want to see it eroded.Mr Cameron has steered clear of tackling it directly - for example by asking for an emergency ""brake"" on free movement, or a cap on numbers - focusing instead on reducing the incentive provided by welfare payments. In a speech last November, David Cameron set out measures to reduce the number of EU nationals moving to the UK.His main proposals were:Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission, has said he is ready to work with Mr Cameron to ""strike a fair deal for the United Kingdom in the EU"". The leaders of other EU nations have previously warned they are unlikely to support major changes to EU treaties to accommodate British demands. But Mr Cameron's general election victory may have given him extra leverage. ""The ball is very much in the court of the UK now,"" a senior EU official told The Guardian. ""It's up to the British to define what they want."" The key figure will be German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is very keen to keep Britain in the EU but has so far been unwilling to make major concessions to enable that to happen. There are fears that a ""pick and mix"" approach to EU treaties would undermine EU cohesion.Mr Cameron has said there is ""no doubt"" his planned reforms will require changes to the treaties governing the European Union. But this would require the unanimous support of all EU members, and may not be possible within the deadline he has set of a referendum before the end of 2017. Any attempt to change EU laws on free movement would meet fierce resistance from some EU nations, particularly Eastern European states. Mr Juncker has said free movement is non-negotiable.Mr Cameron may find it difficult to get unanimous support for his proposals for a four-year waiting period for migrant workers claiming UK benefits. East European EU members would be likely to oppose this, on the grounds that it would discriminate against their citizens.  Attempts to secure opt-outs for the City are unlikely to go down well with other European leaders.However, there are precedents for EU treaty changes to accommodate some countries' specific concerns - for example, the protocol attached to the Lisbon Treaty for Ireland.Mr Cameron has faced repeated calls to say whether he would campaign for Britain's exit from the EU in the referendum if he fails to get what he wants from the renegotiation process. All he has said is that he will ""rule nothing out"". Some Conservative MPs want Britain to leave the EU no matter what David Cameron manages to renegotiate. A larger group are likely to want more concessions than Mr Cameron has so far indicated he is prepared to demand.Senior backbencher David Davis, who was defeated by Mr Cameron for the Tory leadership in 2005, told the Daily Telegraph the majority of the 332 Conservative MPs want Mr Cameron to negotiate an ""opt-out"" power to stop individual EU laws from applying to Britain. The prime minister has said this would be ""impossible"" without Britain leaving the EU.Mr Davis claims as many as 60 Tory MPs would be prepared to rebel and vote for Britain's exit from the EU if the prime minister fails to deliver.Graham Brady, chairman of the Tory backbench 1922 committee, which represents backbenchers, has urged David Cameron to give all Conservative MPs, including ministers, a free vote in the EU referendum.In January, Mr Cameron warned that serving cabinet ministers would have to quit the government if they wanted to campaign to leave the EU if he had secured the reforms to it he wants.In the 1975 referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Economic Community, as the EU was then called, Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson decided to suspend collective responsibility because his cabinet was split on the issue. Ministers were allowed to vote with their consciences and campaign against each other. The majority of them, including Mr Wilson, joined the Yes camp, but left-wingers, such as Tony Benn, played a leading role in the No campaign. The Yes campaign won easily with 67% of the vote."

2015-04-26,Scots Labour leader Murphy to resign,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32760196,"Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy is to resign next month, he has announced.It comes despite Mr Murphy narrowly surviving a vote of no confidence at a meeting of the party's national executive in Glasgow. Mr Murphy said he would tender his resignation alongside a plan to reform the party.He lost his seat in last week's general election as the SNP won 56 of the 59 Scottish seats, leaving Labour with a single MP in Scotland.Mr Murphy said he wanted to have a successor as leader in place by the summer, and confirmed he would not be standing for a seat at the Scottish Parliament in next year's election. Instead, he said it was time to ""do something else"" and that he believed the party would continue to be divided if he remained as leader. His deputy, Kezia Dugdale MSP, will become acting leader until a permanent successor is found. Mr Murphy had faced calls to resign from several MSPs, trade unions and former MPs in the wake of his party's near wipeout at the general election.He insisted he had decided to stand down ahead of the national executive voting by 17-14 in favour of him staying in the job.Speaking at a media conference after the national executive meeting, he said: ""It is clear that a small minority who didn't accept my election as leader of the Scottish Labour Party just five months ago won't accept the vote of the executive today and that will continue to divide the party.""Today I received more support in the executive vote than I did from members of the executive when I stood for election five months ago.""He said it would be up to the executive whether to accept the reforms he would be proposing before he left the post. But he warned: ""A party in such urgent need of reform blocks those changes at its peril.""The former East Renfrewshire MP said Labour had been crushed between ""two nationalisms"" in Scotland and England.Mr Murphy said he left no legacy of bitterness for anyone in the Labour Party, and the only person he was angry at was the person who blamed Scottish Labour for the party's UK-wide general election defeat - a reference to Unite leader Len McCluskey.And he said that in many ways Scottish Labour was the ""least modernised part of the Labour movement"" and that he wanted his successor to be elected under a one member, one vote system.Mr Murphy added: ""The Labour Party's problem is not the link with trade unions, or even the relationship with Unite members - far from it. It is the destructive behaviour of one high profile trade unionist.""The leader of the Scottish Labour Party doesn't serve at the grace of Len McCluskey, and the next leader of the UK Labour Party should not be picked by Len McCluskey.""Mr McCluskey has been a vocal critic of Mr Murphy's leadership and opposed his appointment in December when Mr Murphy won the contest to replace Johann Lamont.Jim Murphy laughed and joked with Scottish Labour's sole MP as he made his way down the hotel corridor to announce his resignation.He certainly brought energy and dynamism to his election campaign - but all that achieved was Ian Murray in Edinburgh South.So as Mr Murphy bows out, who could replace him?The deputy leader Kezia Dugdale may want to step up or Neil Findlay could try again after challenging last time. Maybe the party's finance spokeswoman Jackie Baillie thinks her steady hand could steer the ship.Jenny Marra is also often talked about as future face of the party.Whoever steps into Jim Murphy's red shoes he or she will have to face a difficult 2016 Holyrood election, to put it mildly.There are also more fundamental questions about how the party can possibly move on as it faces a surging SNP.Mr Murphy was very much a creature of ""New Labour"" - but to today's generation that's old Labour.Party members may start looking for someone with no links to the past, neither a Brownite nor a Blairite. A 'cleanskin' - as the politicos put it - may well help re-connect with voters.That's a long way from now though - even some of the party's opponents may view this latest train wreck with a modicum of sympathy. Ms Lamont had resigned after claiming Scottish Labour was treated like a ""branch office"" by the London-based party leadership.Mr Murphy concluded his speech by saying: ""Scotland needs a strong Labour party; Scotland needs a united Labour party. We have been the greatest force for change in our nation's remarkable history. ""The Scottish Labour party will rise again. It will be under someone else's leadership and I am confident about my party's future.""Harriet Harman MP, acting leader of the UK Labour Party, said it would be for Scottish Labour to choose a new leader. She added: ""As a cabinet minister and leader of his party in Scotland, Jim has been a hugely important figure in the Labour Party. He leaves with the best wishes and thanks of our movement.""Labour peer Lord McConnell, a former Scottish first minister, said the party's problems were ""much deeper than one individual and one affiliate"".He said: ""We have a disconnect locally and nationally with wider Scottish society. ""We have a problem with our political positioning in the post devolution age where the party particularly at the UK level has never been comfortable with success in the Scottish parliament and has always tried to see things through a UK prism rather than a Scottish prism.""We need to find a new generation, a new leader, new generation, new ideas, a fresh approach.""In a tweet, Scottish first minister and SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said: ""I wish Jim Murphy all the very best for the future. Leadership is not easy and he deserves credit for standing up for what he believes in.""Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson also reacted on Twitter, saying: ""Jim Murphy announces a managed exit in order to help the party, which is to his credit. But leaves a tough gig for whoever comes next.""The meeting of Scottish Labour's executive was disrupted by protesters who entered the party's headquarters.Police were called and the protesters, who included persistent anti-austerity activists Sean Clerkin and Piers Doughty-Brown, left the building to protest further from the street outside.The protesters were calling for Mr Murphy to remain as leader to ""finish the job of destroying Scottish Labour"".A Police Scotland spokeswoman said officers had been called and found two protestors on the third floor of the building. She added: ""Both left on police arrival. Advice and assistance was given."""
2015-04-26,Labour contenders clash on spending,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32761561,"Prospective Labour leaders have clashed over Labour's record in government in their first public debate in the race to succeed Ed Miliband.Former cabinet ministers including Yvette Cooper and Andy Burnham defended Labour's fiscal record and spending on schools and hospitals.However, candidates from the 2010 intake of MPs argued that the party spent too much while in office.The debate followed Chuka Umunna's withdrawal from the leadership contest.The remaining candidates appeared at the annual conference of the Progress think tank in London.There was agreement that Labour needed to demonstrate economic credibility to regain power, with shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt telling the meeting that the party needed to be ""trusted with public finances and the family finances"".Mr Hunt, who was first elected to Parliament in 2010 when Labour lost power, argued the last Labour government ""spent too much"" and failed to ""leave enough economic headroom to deal with the economic crisis and the recession"".Shadow health minister Liz Kendall said: ""There's absolutely nothing progressive about spending more on debt interest payments than on educating our children.""But shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: ""The Tories have had a triumph of spin over the facts in saying what they said about the economic record of the last Labour government.""The former chief secretary to the Treasury said the deficit did ""grow too large"" in the government's later years but insisted: ""The last Labour government ran more surpluses in its first term than the Tories did in 18 years.""Yvette Cooper, another former chief secretary to the Treasury, said: ""We should never let anybody tell us that it was too many teachers, doctors or nurses that caused Lehman Brothers bank in New York to crash.""Shadow international development secretary Mary Creagh said: ""People have forgotten the economic credibility that the last Labour government had.""She said Labour had built schools and hospitals that were ""treasured in our communities"".Ms Cooper, Mr Burnham, Ms Kendall and Ms Creagh have declared their intention to run for leader, while Mr Hunt told the conference he would make an announcement next week.At the same event, shadow energy secretary Caroline Flint announced she would be running for deputy leader.The Don Valley MP told the Today programme ahead of the debate that Labour lost the election because ""fundamentally the public did not trust us on the economy"".Exeter MP Ben Bradshaw has already announced a bid to be deputy, saying Labour ""must and could win the next election"", but only if it ""broadens its appeal by adopting sensible, centre-left politics which celebrate wealth creation and entrepreneurship"".Former Labour campaign co-ordinator Tom Watson is reported to be crowd-funding a deputy leadership bid, while Walthamstow MP Stella Creasy has said she is ""open to the question"" of running.Barnsley East MP and shadow transport secretary Michael Dugher - a fierce critic of Ed Miliband's election campaign - is to run Mr Burnham's campaign, according to the website LabourList.It is reported that Mr Burnham also has the backing of Labour peer Lord Falconer, who was lord chancellor and justice secretary under Tony Blair and was close to the former PM.Shadow culture secretary Chris Bryant has signalled his backing for Ms Cooper, tweeting that the next leader must be ""someone who's been tried in the fiery furnace of public opinion"".Mr Hunt said on Friday he would be be attending the debate - along with the other four hopefuls - to ""set out my analysis on how we begin to understand what went so wrong and why"".He added: ""We must use this leadership election to ask some very profound questions.""All voices in the party must be heard so that we can have a full and proper assessment as to why the politics of nationalism triumphed in Scotland and huge swathes of England, and how we have allowed the Conservative Party to present a more compelling vision for Britain to so many millions of people.""Speculation still surrounds shadow business secretary Mr Umunna's decision to pull out on Friday, when he said he was not ""comfortable"" with the ""pressure"" of being a candidate.As well as citing extensive pressure and scrutiny Mr Umunna also said he was ruling himself out because of concerns about the impact of the bid on his family.A rising star of the party, Mr Umunna was first elected to Parliament in 2010 - alongside Tristram Hunt and Liz Kendall - before joining the shadow cabinet.Asked about the candidate who might win, Conservative Chancellor George Osborne said: ""The Labour leadership contest has descended into farce.""But it's not actually about personalities. I don't think the Labour Party any more represents the working people of this country who aspire to a better life."""

I'm not suggesting he takes a break from being leader.""Clearly the national executive has the authority, they're the ruling body. ""I'm told that they made a decision. I'm told it was a procedurally correct decision, he is the leader but I think it's important that as leader he takes a break and I think it's important that we work out how these complex questions are answered by a team.""No one person has all the answers. I'm particularly concerned about tone, making sure we get a tone that ensures that the 27 million people who didn't vote for UKIP last week may be persuaded to vote for us in future.""The party has been beset by wrangling since Mr Farage agreed to stay on as leader, days after standing down after failing to get elected in Thanet South.He had pledged before the general election that he would quit the post if he failed to get elected to Parliament.Senior aide Matthew Richardson has left the party, following claims from MEP Patrick O'Flynn that Mr Farage had fallen under the influence of ""inexperienced"" advisers.UKIP has also confirmed the departure of Mr Farage's chief of staff Raheem Kassam.Mr Farage ruled out quitting as leader on BBC's Question Time on Thursday, saying he had ""phenomenal"" support, and has challenged his critics to decide whether they want to stay in the party.In his article, Mr Carswell had said that ""knowing how difficult it is to lead a party makes me admire Nigel Farage all the more"".""I know that I never could,"" he added, stressing that he would find it ""impossible to simultaneously lead UKIP, be the voice of the party in the Commons, represent my Clacton constituents and at the same time be a husband and a dad"".However, he said that ""even leaders need to take a break"", adding: ""Nigel needs to take a break now.""UKIP got nearly four million votes at the election, but returned only one MP - former Conservative Mr Carswell in the Clacton constituency."
2015-04-26,Coasting schools 'must improve',https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/education-32763097,"Education Secretary Nicky Morgan has said new powers to sack head teachers in coasting schools will show ""it is not OK to be just above the level of failing"". Under the plans, ministers could force schools rated as ""requiring improvement"" and missing new government benchmarks to become an academy.Coasting schools have average results which have often flatlined over time.Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, Mrs Morgan said faster action was needed.She said: ""Our big priorities will be to speed up the process for tackling failing schools; extend our academies programme to tackle 'coasting' schools; and deliver on our commitment to open new free schools.""The proposals will be in a new bill due to be introduced in the Queen's Speech. ""First, we will take new powers to step in from the moment that a school is found to be failing,"" Mrs Morgan said.""From day one, regional schools commissioners will be able to bring in new leadership and support from other excellent schools and heads, and we will speed up the process of turning schools into academies to make sure that new expert leadership is found for all schools that need it as quickly as possible.""She said that coasting schools will be put on an immediate notice to improve and could then be taken over and turned into an academy.They will be required to work with a team of ""expert"" head teachers.She said: ""Those that aren't able to demonstrate a clear plan for improvement will be given new leadership - we know this works in turning schools around.""More than 3,300 schools in England are labelled ""requires improvement"", but the plans are unlikely to cover that many schools.Under the current system, secondary schools are considered to be failing, and therefore eligible for intervention, if fewer than 40% of their students score at least five Cs at GCSE, including English and maths, and they do not meet national averages in pupil progress.In primary schools, the threshold for intervention is if fewer than 65% of pupils get Level 4 in reading, writing and maths and a below average number of pupils make the expected amount of progress.It is not yet clear how coasting schools will be deemed in need of intervention.It is understood that a new category will be devised covering schools which are rated as ""requires improvement"" and which fail to meet a new set of standards on improvement."
2015-04-26,Co-op Group to keep political funding,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-32762858,"The Co-operative Group has decided to continue financially supporting the Co-operative Party, which has strong ties to Labour.Members of the group, the UK's biggest mutual organisation, voted on the issue at their annual general meeting.They passed a motion by 48,579 for, to 39,479 against, to approve ""political expenditures"" of up to £1m which support the movement's objectives.Last year the Co-op Group gave £625,000 to the Co-op Party.This figure was down on the sums donated in previous years. The AGM also included a vote on new corporate governance procedures which would mean members having less of a direct say.The Co-operative Group is still recovering from a period of financial mismanagement and some members have recently expressed concerns about how elections to the board are chosen.The banking arm of the group came close to collapse in 2013, bringing the whole group to a £2.5bn annual loss that year. The Co-op Party includes among its members a number of Labour MPs, including shadow chancellor Chris Leslie and Walthamstow MP Stella Creasy. The politicians stand as candidates of both the Co-operative Party and the Labour Party, and the two political movements have strong historical ties. The board asked the members of the Co-operative Group whether they wanted to continue financially supporting the Co-operative Party, or any other party. Allan Leighton, chairman of the Co-op Group, said: ""There's a clear remit from the members to continue to support the Labour Party.""It allows us to now have a conversation with the Co-op Labour Party about what we do next.""There was also a members' motion on the agenda, put forward by those in favour of making political donations of up to £1m a year.The motion to approve political funding ""not to exceed £1m per annum"" was carried by 55.17% to 44.83%.BBC business correspondent Joe Lynam said: ""To meet a £1.5bn hole in its accounts - mostly stemming from its banking division - the Co-op Group has had to sell off parts of its businesses and hand over majority control of its bank to American hedge funds.""It's also in the process of radically changing the way it runs itself into a more corporate structure with less of a direct say by its members.""He said that ""in theory"", each of the 2.8 million Co-op members could vote on a series of motions about the reforms, as well as how its bosses are paid, and retaining the links to the Co-operative party.One of the group's largest independent societies, Midcounties, recently threatened legal action over a shortlist of six candidates for the group's board being reduced to three - the number of positions available - before a member vote.

2015-04-26,Osborne plans July 'stability' Budget,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32761566,"Chancellor George Osborne has said that he will deliver a new Budget on 8 July.He claimed it would have ""a laser-like focus"" on raising productivity and living standards.He said he was making the unusual move of having a second Budget in one year in order to ""deliver on the commitments we have made to working people"".Labour said the chancellor would have to set out ""who is going to pay"" for what it called ""uncosted promises"" in the election campaign.Speaking outside 11 Downing Street, the chancellor gave a broad outline of his plans for the forthcoming Budget but refused to be drawn on the details, including the Conservatives' planned £12bn of welfare cuts.""I don't want to wait to deliver on the commitments we have made to working people,"" he said.""It will continue with the balanced plan we have to deal with our debts, invest in our health service and reform welfare to make work pay.""But there will also be a laser-like focus on making our economy more productive so we raise living standards across our country.""We're going to put Britain into good shape for the long term.""The last Budget was held on 18 March and included tax cuts for first-time house buyers.Writing in the Sun, Mr Osborne admitted it was ""unusual"" to have two Budgets in the same year, but he wanted to turn ""promises made in the election into a reality"".Again, Mr Osborne did not specifically outline how the Conservatives plan to fulfil a pledge to cut £12bn in welfare spending but said he wants to make the welfare system ""fair for the people who pay for it"".He writes: ""We will protect the NHS and give it more funding each and every year, while making savings across Whitehall. ""We'll crack down hard on tax avoidance and aggressive tax planning by the rich - because everyone should pay their fair share.  ""We will always protect the most vulnerable, but we also need a welfare system that's fair to the people who pay for it. If you can work you should be working, so we'll take the next steps in our benefit reforms to make sure that happens.""Second, we've got to go on helping businesses create jobs in Britain, so we move towards full employment. That means facing a hard truth: in Britain we produce about a quarter less for every hour we work than countries like America or Germany. Fixing that long-running productivity weakness is the big challenge for the next five years.""So in the Budget we'll spend less on welfare, and instead invest to create three million more apprenticeships, so that young people can learn a trade, get better jobs and earn more.""After the Budget in March independent forecaster the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said that Mr Osborne needed to spell out exactly how he plans to cut £12bn from welfare spending.Of those £12bn planned cuts, £2bn were outlined ahead of the general election - all the cuts are supposed to be in place by 2017-18.Labour's shadow energy and climate change secretary, Caroline Flint, accused the Tories of making ""a number of uncosted promises"" during the election campaign.She told the BBC: ""It will be interesting to see who is going to pay for those uncosted policies when they bring the Budget in July."""

If it isn't, stop it and do something else.""He also criticised Mr Farage's comments about HIV patients during the TV leaders' debate last month.While debating about the NHS, Mr Farage said: ""You can come into Britain from anywhere in the world and get diagnosed with HIV and get the retro-viral drugs that cost up to £25,000 per year per patient.""Mr Carswell wrote: ""By all means we should highlight the problem of health tourism. But we need to admit that using the example of HIV patients to make the point was ill-advised.""He said the party needed to strike ""the right tone"" and added: ""UKIP has been at its most persuasive when we have been most optimistic.""Anger is never a great way to motivate people - at least not for very long.""The party has been beset by wrangling since Mr Farage agreed to stay on as leader, days after standing down after failing to get elected in Thanet South.He had pledged before the general election that he would quit the post if he failed to get elected to Parliament.Matthew Richardson has left the party, following claims from MEP Patrick O'Flynn that Mr Farage had fallen under the influence of ""inexperienced"" advisers.

They absolutely loved how he helped them and he was a highly-regarded local MP,"" Mr Bone said.""He stood up for what was right rather than what the party line was. In those days - the John Major years - it was much more difficult to stand up against the party machine. He had strong views on Europe.""Sir Peter started his career as an insurance broker, joining the Wycombe Young Conservatives in 1949 and the Oxford University Conservative Association in 1951.He went on to become a Conservative councillor on Buckinghamshire County Council between 1961 and 1967.Wellingborough mayor-elect Barry Graves also paid tribute to Sir Peter, remembering him as a ""very strong constituency MP"".""I remember going out and canvassing with him and he would go everywhere. He knew the area and the people. He was very much a man of the local constituency.""He was ""a very approachable man"", Mr Graves added.Sir Peter was knighted in 1994. "

2015-04-26,PM will 'look at' powers proposals,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32746049,"David Cameron has said he would ""look at"" any proposals for further powers for Scotland but wants to get the Smith Commission plans implemented first.The prime minister was speaking after meeting Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon in Edinburgh.Mr Cameron said he made a ""commitment"" to include a devolution bill in the Queen's Speech later this month.Ms Sturgeon argued the Smith Commission proposals were ""a good starting point"" but did not go far enough.The prime minister has pledged to include a bill on devolution in this month's Queen's Speech which would be based on the cross-party Smith Commission agreement. The Smith proposals included giving Holyrood the power to set income tax rates and bands, as well as control over a share of VAT and some welfare benefits. But Ms Sturgeon's SNP also wants the Scottish Parliament to be given powers over business taxes, employment law, the minimum wage and additional powers over welfare.Speaking after meeting Ms Sturgeon, Mr Cameron told the BBC: ""Let's make sure Smith is implemented in full. I'm going to keep the commitment I made to the people of Scotland. Let's get that done first because it does create a really strong Scottish Parliament.""He added: ""Of course, if people want to make future proposals I'll look at them.""The prime minister again said he did not support full fiscal autonomy for Scotland - the responsibility for all areas of tax and spending except defence and foreign affairs - stating that it would mean £7bn of cuts or extra tax-raising.What Nicola Sturgeon is trying to say is she has a mandate. She has 56 out of the 59 MPs elected in Scotland and she won 50% of the vote - unprecedented here in Scotland.She says that gives her leverage to push David Cameron. David Cameron says he wants to keep the nation together.The language coming out of Westminster last week was very much a cordial one. 'We will listen'.Nicola Sturgeon has warned him that if he doesn't listen, then the people of Scotland will judge him accordingly.Ms  Sturgeon described the hour-long talks at her official residence at Bute House as ""constructive and business-like"". She said Mr Cameron had made a ""commitment"" that the Smith proposals would be implemented ""as agreed"".""But secondly the prime minister agreed that he would look at proposals that we would now send to suggest the areas we can go beyond Smith,"" Ms Sturgeon said.""There was no agreement in terms of the substance of that but we will submit those proposals, the prime minister has said they will consider them and there will be a meeting to look at how we take that further forward.""Referring to her party's success in last week's general election, which saw the SNP win 56 out of 59 Scottish seats, Ms Sturgeon said: ""People in Scotland have now voted fairly convincingly for the SNP and sent a message that we want the Smith Commission proposals to go further and be built on.""The ball is in his court but I'm going into this in good faith.""She added: ""David Cameron and I are a world apart politically but, where we can, I'm determined to do business in the interests of the people of Scotland and across the UK.""She said she would have a ""constructive and business-like"" relationship with the prime minister. The two leaders shook hands on the front steps of Bute House as Mr Cameron arrived. Mr Cameron left the building shortly before 11:00, almost an hour after he had arrived.The two sides agreed to hold more regular discussions in the future, possibly quarterly. "
2015-04-26,Umunna withdraws Labour leader bid,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32748106,"Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna has withdrawn from the Labour party leadership contest, just days after throwing his hat into the ring.The MP, 36, said in a statement that he was not comfortable with the level of pressure and scrutiny that came with being a leadership candidate.Mr Umunna also cited concerns about the impact of the bid on his family.BBC political editor Nick Robinson said the MP's team insisted no ""unwelcome press story"" lay behind the move.But Mr Umunna had been shocked by the level of scrutiny of himself, his mother, sister and girlfriend, he said.You can follow the latest reaction here.A rising star of the party, Mr Umunna was first elected to Parliament in 2010 before joining the shadow cabinet.He confirmed his candidacy for the Labour leadership via a post on his Facebook page on 12 May, saying the party under Ed Miliband had failed to appeal to enough voters in England.But on Friday he said he had not found the leadership bid to be ""a comfortable experience"".I understand that Chuka Umunna has told friends that ""this is not right for me or people close to me. I'm human, the rest of my life is more important to me than politics.""The shadow business secretary has been distressed by the degree of scrutiny he, his family and his girlfriend have come under since he declared his intention to stand for the labour leadership.I am told that this includes reporters waiting outside the houses of relatives late at night.Friends of Mr Umunna deny that he is nervous of not getting the support of enough MPs to run for the leadership; they point out that he already has half the necessary names and that there are some weeks to go.The shadow business secretary now wants to play a leading role in arguing that Britain should stay in the EU and does not rule out seeking the leadership in the future.He said he thought he had understood ""the scrutiny and attention a leadership contest would bring"", but added: ""However, since the night of our defeat last week I have been subject to the added level of pressure that comes with being a leadership candidate.""The shadow business secretary said he had wondered if it was too soon for him to stand for the leadership, and ""I fear it was."" He also cited concerns about the impact on ""the rest of one's life"" and those close to him.""Consequently, after further reflection, I am withdrawing my candidacy,"" he said.Mr Umunna said he would continue to serve as shadow business secretary and hoped to ""play a leading role"" in Labour's campaign to keep the UK in the EU during the forthcoming in/out referendum.Commenting on the news, Labour former culture secretary Ben Bradshaw - who is expected to run for deputy leader - said Mr Umunna was a ""terrible loss"" to the field.He told the BBC's Daily Politics the Streatham MP had been the candidate the Conservative Party ""feared the most"".""And if it's the result of pressure on an extended family or an extended group of friends, I think that's a very sad reflection on our political culture,"" he said.Chuka Umunna feels ""liberated"", he told me, by his decision to quit the Labour leadership race.He hopes to be given a good role (shadow chancellor, I wonder?) by whoever becomes Labour leader. And I expect he'll become very high profile in the campaign to keep Britain in Europe, which is increasingly looking like it will be next May.He'll endorse a candidate in the next four weeks before nominations close. It will be very interesting to see who he piles in behind.Read more from Allegra (see post 13.23).Former Labour leader Lord Kinnock said he thought Mr Umunna had made the right decision.He said: ""If he felt in his soul that he wasn't prepared to subject himself - and more importantly his family - to the kind of attention which is fairly typical, sadly, these days, he has done absolutely the right thing.""There is no point at all in inflicting avoidable, unnecessary misery on those you love most.""Leadership contender Mary Creagh said she had ""huge respect"" for Mr Umunna, telling BBC Radio 4's World at One programme it took ""courage"" to withdraw from the leadership race.Mr Umunna was ""a big beast"" and would play a ""big role"" in the future of the Labour Party, she added.Yvette Cooper, Andy Burnham, Liz Kendall and Mary Creagh have already thrown their hats into the ring for Labour's top job while a number of other potential candidates, including Dan Jarvis, Alan Johnson and David Lammy, have ruled themselves out. Candidates must secure nominations from 34 colleagues - 15% of the party's MPs - by 15 June to make it on to ballot papers, which will be sent to members in August ahead of the leader's election a month later."

However, Mr Justice Stuart Smith at Southwark Crown Court said there was a ""very strong likelihood"" a custodial sentence would follow.The jury heard how Mote submitted numerous false expenses claims for payment for work that organisations had allegedly carried out on his behalf.Mote claimed the money was to pay whistleblowers in cash through third parties. He also said he had been ""targeted for being an anti-EU MEP.""During his time an MEP he also made £250,000 legitimate expenses claims.No date has been set for the sentencing."

2015-04-26,Round-up: BBC experts' analysis,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/election-2015-32650417,"The political future of the United Kingdom has become clearer after the results of the general election emerged around the country.David Cameron says he hopes to govern for all of the UK after the Conservatives took 331 seats - enough to form a slender majority in the Commons.Labour has been all but wiped out by the SNP in Scotland and suffered a disappointing set of results elsewhere, while the Lib Dems are left with just eight MPs after many party heavyweights such as Vince Cable and Danny Alexander lost their seats.So with battles won and lost and the fall-out and celebrations beginning, BBC correspondents examine the implications and challenges that lie ahead for the new government - and for those whose political careers have been ended by voters.No pollster, no pundit, no political leader saw it coming - not even David Cameron himself.Governing parties don't gain seats. Parties that have implemented painful cuts and are promising more certainly don't. Until that is the Conservative Party did - achieving what had seemed to be Mission Impossible - a Tory majority.Until that is David Cameron's personal triumph which triggered the near simultaneous resignation of his three principle opponents - Messrs Miliband, Clegg and Farage.They did so in part because they helped to crush their partners in coalition these last five years - reducing the Liberal Democrat parliamentary party to a size when it can fit into two London taxis and still have two seats to spare.In part because the extraordinary tidal wave of support for the SNP swept dozens of once safe Labour seats away.In part because Nigel Farage persuaded millions to vote for him but secured just one seat - not, though, the one he was standing in.Read more from Nick Robinson hereThe question uppermost in the prime minister's mind as he assembles his new government is how to keep the kingdom united.""Above all I want to bring our country together,"" he revealed after the result, ""to reclaim a mantle we should never have lost - the mantle of one nation, one United Kingdom"".Looking at the political landscape from Land's End today is very different to the view from John O'Groats.A sea of Conservative and Unionist blue dominates the scene across much of England, while a field of SNP nationalist yellow stretches to the horizon and beyond from the north.David Cameron's greatest challenge is to prevent the union he supports being torn apart by mutual resentment - resentment from Scotland at a Westminster government dominated by English Tories, and resentment from England at the preferential treatment people think is being given to the Scots.Those who assumed the future of the Union had been safeguarded by the Scottish referendum must think again.Read more from Mark Easton hereOne thing is rock-solid true: the Conservatives who worked on this campaign are as surprised by the result as the pollsters, pundits, politicians and general population.Maybe they shouldn't be - the economy is in good shape and the Conservatives had incumbency advantage.But when I travelled back from the prime minister's last rally with a group of exhausted Conservative campaign officials it was clear that 290 seats was a hoped-for target.No-one talked about anything over 300 seats, and no-one even mentioned an overall majority.So what special sauce pushed David Cameron into No 10 with a Commons majority?Mr Cameron had two simple messages in the campaign and he rarely veered away from them; the first - the economy is in good shape and the recovery is threatened by Labour. And the second - the SNP would hold a Labour-led government to ransom.Read more from Jonny Dymond hereBrian Taylor, BBC political editor, ScotlandOf all the comments on the overnight apocalypse, undoubtedly the most straightforward came from a defeated Scottish Labour MP.Since there were quite a few of them, let me narrow the focus a little. Come on down, Tom Harris.Mr Harris had plainly anticipated defeat. Nonetheless, he looked suitably lugubrious as his fate was confirmed.Why, he was asked eagerly, had Labour lost? ""Because we did not win enough votes.""Psephologically, it is perfect. Complete in itself. Psychologically, it sums up Labour's gloom without descending into subsidiary matters such as leadership, strategy and the rest. As a forward-thinking strategy, it is ideal. Win more votes. Simple.Read more from Brian Taylor hereThis has been an election which may have more profound consequences than almost any in living memory.We now face a generational decision about our future in Europe, with an EU referendum in two years' time almost certain.There will also be serious questions about the future of the Union, following an SNP landslide that has turned Scotland into a virtual one-party state.David Cameron's victory also represents a colossal achievement.Only once before in recent history has an incumbent government increased its majority - and that was Mrs Thatcher in her prime in the 1980s.It is also a significant personal victory for Mr Cameron and a rebuff for those in his party who had become increasingly sceptical about his ability to win.But while it may represent a defeat for those Tories who saw this election as a potential opportunity to rid themselves of David Cameron, he must now govern with a wafer-thin majority.For the SNP, their stunning victory can only increase the pressure on Nicola Sturgeon to include a commitment to a second independence referendum in her party's manifesto for next year's Scottish elections.It is an election which has not just defied all the predictions of the pollsters and pundits - but which may yet prompt the most fundamental re-casting of British politics for a generation.Read more from Norman Smith hereAfter an extraordinary night, some brief conclusions:Read more from James Landale hereIs this the end of the union?That is the question many people will be asking this morning after the party which has fought for Scottish independence for 80 years swept to victory.The answer from the jubilant Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon is a firm ""No"".She insists that her MPs will speak for all of Scotland, not just for the 45% who voted for the country to leave the United Kingdom last September.In the closing hours of the most extraordinary election campaign which anyone in Scotland can remember, Ms Sturgeon turned to talk of ""legitimacy.""That will be her watchword in the coming days as she argues that the prime minister cannot ignore the democratic will of the Scottish people.Politically, Scotland and England this morning look and feel like very different countries.Read more from James Cook hereAfter weeks of chatter about an election too close to call, it wasn't that close at all.David Cameron will be continuing as our prime minister.So, what is all this likely to mean?A referendum on whether the UK stays in, or leaves, the European Union, within the next two-and-a-half years.A race to be the next leader of the Labour Party.A race to be the next leader of the Liberal Democrats.And a huge new presence of Scottish National Party MPs at Westminster.And so here's another thing we know for certain this morning: Politics ain't going to be boring any time soon.Read more from Chris Mason hereFor Labour the story of their terrible night is rapidly turning into the search for a new leader. So who will that be?Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, is almost certain to run.  Even before this election, both he and another almost inevitable candidate, Chuka Umunna, had raised eyebrows inside the party at the work they had put in, preparing the ground with members and the unions for potential bids.Yvette Cooper, before the election, was still thought not to have made up her mind over whether to run. That decision has been made perhaps a little easier as her husband, Ed Balls, has lost his seat.She is certainly potentially in the frame, along with two lesser known names - Liz Kendall and Dan Jarvis - two MPs who were only elected in 2010 for the first time. This could be their moment. But whoever is in the job, they face a monumental task.Read Laura Kuenssberg's Twitter hereSterling is up (the most for seven years against the euro), share prices are up (especially bank shares like Lloyds and RBS, and energy shares such as Centrica), government bond prices are up.To state the obvious, investors love the Tories' general election victory.There are a few reasons.One (no surprise here) is that Labour's threat of breaking up banks and imposing energy price caps has been lifted.Second is that investors have been discounting days and weeks of wrangling after polling day over who would form the government - and so they are semi-euphoric that we already know who's in charge.Third, many investors tend to be economically conservative and instinctively Conservative.But although the City may be a bit drunk on the result, its pleasure in Ed Miliband's and Ed Balls' humiliation may be making it a bit blind - perhaps dangerously so - to some bumps in the economic road ahead.Read more from Robert Peston hereNigel Farage dreamed of holding the balance of power, but in the end his UKIP party is now worse off than when it came into the election.At the seventh time of asking he was rejected - this time by the people of Thanet South. It was a similar story in Rochester and Strood where Mark Reckless, who sensationally defected from the Tories last year, was also sent packing.In seats on UKIP's target list, like Thurrock in Essex, the party failed to make gains. In Grimsby - where Mr Farage went twice in the last six weeks - they came third.UKIP got around four million votes - with especially strong showings in north-east and south-east England - but it's ended up with just one MP, and a vacancy at the top. This has led to UKIP attacking the current system of choosing MPs, which it's described as ""busted"" and ""dysfunctional"".In one sense, this campaign was a complete failure and it's left an aftermath of angry voters, and others wondering if the UKIP bubble has burst.Read Robin Brant's Twitter hereI monitored 91 GB-wide voting intention polls during the 2015 election campaign and found nothing in them to prepare me for the final outcome.The good news for the pollsters was that their share for the Lib Dems was pretty close, as were the shares for UKIP, the Greens and the catch-all category of Others.The bad news for the polling industry was that the crucial shares for Conservative and Labour were the ones where they came most adrift.When all the qualifications of margins of error are allowed, there did appear to be a systematic overstatement of the Labour share and an equally systematic understatement of the Conservative one.It is for the pollsters to decide whether to conduct a review of their performance but I trust they will avoid the initial knee-jerk reaction of the immediate aftermath of the 1992 polls debacle.This general election performance follows the performance of the polls in the 2014 Scottish referendum where the choice was simply binary and yet all the polls were out by between 4-6%.Something is wrong. A lot of us would like to know what it is.Read more from David Cowling hereThe words ""political earthquake"" have been translated into numerous European languages, making front page news across the continent.While Britons now examine the domestic minutiae of the election result, here in mainland Europe the vote means one thing: a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU. And that has the potential to create an earthquake of its own.The guardian of the EU treaties Mr Cameron wants to change - Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker - has said again he'd listen to what Britain's new government proposed.Read more from Katya Adler here"

He's not the only party leader to face an attempted ousting. But can you recover from such a revolt?In 2006, the Labour prime minister was the target of what became known as the ""curry house conspiracy"" - a coup to remove him and install his chancellor, Gordon Brown, as prime minister.It would lead to several of the plotters' resignations - but not Mr Blair's. However, it was successful to a degree in that it forced the party leader into naming a departure date.The move against him was reportedly masterminded by Tom Watson, a defence minister at the time, who was also rumoured to have had a secret meeting with Mr Brown on the eve of the revolt.Apparently, Mr Watson and three fellow West Midlands MPs - Sion Simon, David Wright (both ministerial aides) and Khalid Mahmood - met over a biryani at a Wolverhampton curry house to discuss the PM's future, before dispatching a missive calling for him to quit.The letter - which attracted the support of a number of normally loyal Labour MPs - was leaked to the press, and ultimately resulted in Mr Watson's resignation.In his parting letter, the West Bromwich East MP took a shot at the prime minister, who he said should step down in the interests of party and country.Mr Blair denounced his actions and branded the former minister ""disloyal, discourteous and wrong"", saying he would have sacked him if he had not resigned.But Mr Watson's departure was swiftly followed by the resignations of six other junior members of government - who had also signed the rebel letter - in protest at the prime minister's refusal to say when he would step down as Labour leader.The whole affair resulted in Mr Blair announcing his intention to step aside within 12 months - which he duly did, on 27 June 2007.But it did nothing to quash internal dissent and speculation in the party over the future leadership of the party.Labour prime minister Gordon Brown found his leadership under threat in 2009 after one of his cabinet ministers dramatically quit the government and called for him to resign.Work and Pensions Secretary James Purnell - a former aide to Tony Blair - resigned from his post after the polls closed in the local and European elections, in which Labour was forecast to do badly.Explaining his decision to quit, Mr Purnell said the prime minister made a Conservative victory ""more, not less, likely"".It was Mr Brown's first direct challenge from a cabinet minister - but it would not topple the Labour leader as senior members of government refused to follow Mr Purnell's lead.Mr Brown was safe for the time being. But several months later, in January 2010, a fresh leadership challenge was mounted by two senior former Labour cabinet ministers.Geoff Hoon and Patricia Hewitt wrote to all Labour MPs, saying the party was ""deeply divided"" over Mr Brown's leadership and that the best way to resolve the issue was by way of secret ballot.They insisted it was not an ""attempted coup"" but a necessary step to resolve divisions within the party.But the duo could only muster the public support of a handful of backbenchers long-opposed to Mr Brown, with the majority of the party's MPs less than impressed by the move, which came just weeks before the general election.As the day wore on, a succession of cabinet ministers came out to back the PM, suggesting there was little momentum behind the plot - although it was noted that several were not exactly gushing in their support of Mr Brown.As history tells us, neither leadership challenge bore fruit but they reflected the internal doubts and divisions over Mr Brown at the helm.As leadership toppling attempts go, this one in 2014 was regarded as a particularly ""botched"" and ""shambolic coup"". Indeed, former Lib Dem leader Lord (Paddy) Ashdown described the move as a ""plot of deep malice"".Its instigator, Lord (Matthew) Oakeshott - a close ally of the-then Business Secretary Vince Cable - tried to unseat Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg.The peer was found to have commissioned secret polls suggesting the party would do better at the 2015 general election without Mr Clegg in the driving seat.The man Lord Oakeshott had long had in mind to take Mr Clegg's place - Mr Cable, who was on government business in China at the time - was forced to publicly condemn his friend's actions and state his backing for Mr Clegg.But Lord Oakeshott said the business secretary had in fact known about his polls and their findings.Nevertheless, the peer - who was denounced by the Lib Dem leadership for spending money that could have been spent on campaigning - quit the party, and issued a warning shot on his way out about the Lib Dems' future prospects.Mr Cable largely emerged unscathed but he faced questions about his loyalty to the leader. Although the two sought to put paid to reports of a rift with a (painfully awkward, 'nothing to see here, folks') stage-managed pint in a pub.Although the revolt failed, and Mr Clegg remained at the helm, the Lib Dems did go on to suffer a trouncing at the general election, losing nearly 50 of its MPs - one of them, Mr Cable himself - prompting his leader to quit.The Conservatives have a reputation for being more ruthless than their party rivals when it comes to getting rid of leaders they sense are no longer effectual.But, in 1995, Prime Minister John Major - tired of persistent rumours of a leadership challenge - decided to take the bull by the horns and trigger a surprise leadership election to silence his detractors.His own backbenchers had questioned Mr Major's ability to unite and lead the party, which was deeply divided over Europe.So ""put up or shut up"", he told them as he tendered his resignation as Conservative Party leader but not prime minister.But then stepped forward eurosceptic MP John Redwood, who resigned from the cabinet in order to contest Mr Major's leadership.This was unexpected by many, as the PM had said there had been assurances from his cabinet that none would stand against him.But Mr Major went on to win the ensuing election with a comfortable defeat over his challenger, who was not included in the PM's consequent cabinet reshuffle.No further contested leadership election took place until after the Conservatives' defeat at the 1997 general election, paving the way for William Hague to take over the running of the party.Not all attempts to oust a party leader end in failure: as Margaret Thatcher found out to her peril.With three electoral victories under her belt, the Conservative prime minister's downfall would come at the hands of her own party - not the voters.It was on 1 November 1990 when Geoffrey (now Lord) Howe - one of Mrs Thatcher's longest-serving ministers - resigned over differences with the party leader over Europe.In his now infamous speech on the floor of the House of Commons, he attacked the PM's policies and leadership style, comparing being one of her cabinet ministers to opening the batting at cricket only to find his bat had been ""broken... by the team captain"".It sparked the beginning of the end of the 11-year Thatcher reign.Michael (now Lord) Heseltine seized on the opportunity to challenge the prime minister in the ensuing leadership contest, from which she would eventually withdraw and John Major emerge as her successor. Reflecting on the revolt and its implications on the Conservative Party, Baroness Thatcher's biographer Charles Moore wrote: ""Because the coup was unjustified, and so trust broke down, the politics of the next 15 years were those of civil war."""
2015-04-26,Election swings and roundabouts,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-32741924,"If election manifesto claims are all about smoke and mirrors, should we now add swings and roundabouts to the political metaphor?There's an intriguing aspect to the general election results in the Midlands that puzzled me.It's the striking contrast in the swings between Labour and the Conservatives.David Cameron and his campaign strategists knew they were home and dry when Nuneaton was the first Midlands marginal to declare.It was not only a Tory hold but a swing to the Conservatives from Labour of 3%.I was in the Nottingham suburb of Beeston awaiting the result of the Broxtowe count. Would its high profile Conservative MP Anna Soubry survive a red surge?Nuneaton set the pattern. Across the Midlands, both east and west, there was a uniform swing of between three and four per cent to the Tories - Warwickshire North 3%, Amber Valley 4%, Derbyshire South 4% and Sherwood 4%. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan topped the Tory swingometer in the Midlands marginals with 5% in Loughborough.Yet in the big cities, it was a very different story. The swing went to Labour.So in Nottingham East they enjoyed a 6% swing, Nottingham South 5.8%, Leicester South 7.3%, Leicester West 5%, Birmingham Hall Green 12%, Birmingham Hodge Hill 8%.If swings to Labour on this scale had gone beyond the city ring road roundabouts and into the suburbs, Ed Miliband would have become prime minister by now.In confidence, one senior Labour insider in Nottingham told me its success in the city wards was down to organisation, experience and its teams of activists.""We won the ground war. If Nottingham's city boundaries were extended into Sherwood and Broxtowe, we would have won those constituencies as well,"" he told me.Labour leadership candidate, Leicester West's Liz Kendall has identified her party's problem beyond the ring road roundabout.It's about reaching out to Middle England.""We need to show people that we understand their aspirations and ambitions for the future,"" she told the Sunday Times.The problem for Labour was that Middle England was not interested in what the party offered…and still isn't. The Cameron brand worked its magic in those Midlands marginals... it'll take something or someone special to break up that ballot box relationship."
2015-04-26,Royal 'lobbying',https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32740154,"Prince Charles sent 27 letters to then Prime Minister Tony Blair and members of his government between September 2004 and March 2005, ""despite the Freedom of Information Act!"" as the prince joked in one.But did his suggestions and concerns have any bearing on the behaviour of Mr Blair's government?The request: Prince Charles expresses his worries over an EU directive on complementary medicines ""which is… effectively outlawing the use of certain herbal extracts"".  Mr Blair replied, offering moral support and practical help. He agreed that ""the implementation as it is currently planned is crazy"" and set out an action plan that included delaying implementation for all existing products to 2011. What happened: Herbal products were not required to be authorised until 2011, just as Mr Blair had promised. Prince Charles continues to sell his own brand of complementary products, Duchy Herbals, through Boots and Waitrose. The request: Writing to Mr Blair, the prince expresses a ""growing sense of anxiety"" that the Hill Farming Allowance, which supports farmers working on Britain's uplands, could be scrapped. In his reply, the prime minister said he understood that the Hill Farm Allowance would continue until 2007. What happened: The allowance lasted until the end of Labour's tenure in 2010, when it was abolished.The request: Just 18 months after the US-led invasion of Iraq, Prince Charles raised the issue of poor performance of Lynx helicopters in high temperatures, saying: ""I fear that this is just one more example of where our Armed Forces are being asked to do an extremely challenging job (particularly in Iraq) without the necessary resources.""Mr Blair replied: ""On the subject of the Lynx helicopter, the limitations of the existing platform, particularly in the extremely challenging environment within Iraq, are well recognised by the Ministry of Defence."" He added that replacement of the helicopters would be a priority. What happened: Mr Blair's comments go much further than what he was saying about the subject at the time. In the event, though, the fleet was not fully upgraded until 2011.The request: Prince Charles lamented that the government's TB prevention plans might not ""include a commitment to deal with the badger problem in the immediate future"" and pushed strongly for a cull, saying: ""All I can say is that I do urge you to look again at introducing a proper cull of badgers where it is necessary.""Mr Blair sympathised, saying he could ""personally see the case for culling badgers"". However, he was unwilling to commit to a cull.  What happened: Culling trials were conducted from 1998-2005. The final results, published in 2008, said that the badger cull could ""make no meaningful contribution"" to curbing bovine TB. It wasn't until 2013 that a full culling programme began in two pilot areas. These ended with the conclusion that the pilots had been neither humane nor effective at curbing the spread of TB.The request: Then Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell wrote to Prince Charles to say she had decided to give parts of the historic Smithfield meat market Grade II listed status, and was trying to persuade deputy prime minister John Prescott to ""call in"" the planning application to prevent demolition of other parts of the site. She had been swayed by evidence provided by Sir Neil Cossons, who was English Heritage chair at the time, after he had been asked by the prince to add his support. Prince Charles replied that he was ""extremely glad to read of your appreciation of the value of this group of buildings"". According to the Guardian, market workers desperate to see the redevelopment of the site invited the prince to meet them to discuss it, but his office said he was ""unlikely to accept as he did not want to interfere in the planning process"".What happened: Smithfield market is still the subject of planning battles a decade on. Successive planning applications have been refused by ministers. Last year then Communities Secretary Eric Pickles rejected plans for an office development on the site, stating that ""the extent of damage that the application would cause to the important heritage assets at Smithfield runs entirely counter to national and policy objectives intended to protect such assets from harm"".In March, the Museum of London announced a move from its current Barbican site to the Smithfield market building."
2015-04-26,Election fallout,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32703139,"""Some of those gimmicks - that tombstone, whatever idiot thought that up I do not know!""I was talking to the former Mayor of Crawley in Sussex, John Mortimer, in the town's Labour Supporters Club about the vexed question of what went wrong, and where Labour should go next. This seat is one of those southern seats Labour hoped to take, but failed.I hear a whole range of views in the club.""They didn't give nothing to depend on, they should be clear, and a little bit more down to Earth."" ""Good party, wrong leader, they don't look after business enough.""Councillor John Stanley tells me: ""I think in a way we did go too left, but now we can go a bit centre-left, or centre, depending who the new leader is.""The former mayor sums up the mood on the doorstep: ""Whatever we told them, they didn't believe us.""  Expect to hear all those views, and more, in the coming leadership contest. Step back from the angst of supporters, and it may not be that hard to see why Labour failed.  An economic recovery, hailed by independent organisations as the result of government policy, undid a party that had loudly proclaimed for five years that the coalition's policies would lead to economic disaster. Combine that with an uncharismatic and uninspirational leader, then you might argue no further debate is necessary.Fat chance of that. Defeat breeds resentment, and this one has opened up old divisions.  A chorus of Blairties, led by the man himself, has declared that Ed's problem was ignoring those with aspiration and ambition, failing to appeal to those running business. Incidentally, I've been ticked off by the perspicacious editor of the New Statesman, Jason Cowley, for using the ""unhelpful"" term ""Blairites"".I can't think of another description that fits Tony, Lord Mandelson, Lord Adonis and David Miliband quite so well. But call them what you will, the message was clear - Ed was too left wing, Labour should move back to the centre, or, if you like, to the right.Reading Mr Blair's pithy analysis, listening to Lord Mandelson's gripping and savage eloquence, describing a party sent out to shout: ""We love the poor and hate the rich,"" and so ignoring the middle, and you realise strong emotions are in play.But back to the future may not be sufficient. Of course elections are won on the centre ground. But grandees grinding axes, affronted by the failure of boys who used to make their tea, may be creating so much noise that they can't hear more insistent sounds.  For there are several elephants trumpeting loudly as they cram into the small space of the shadow cabinet room. Imagine these beasts are as gaily decorated as Berlin buddy bears. One is decked out in red, another in imperial purple bunting, and another, a mammoth, strong tusked and ice rimmed, painted yellow with tartan trimmings.Take the last first. The Scottish wipeout is Labour's biggest problem. Fail to solve it, and Labour can forget ever having a comfortable majority again. It is hard to argue Labour were wiped out in Scotland because the SNP outflanked them to the right with their appeal to the business community and the ambitious and aspirational. But it is true the SNP drew in to people from left, right and centre, just as the modernisers say Labour should. It was the politics of economic self-interest, but cast in a very different light. Tribally sneering at ""the reactionary ideology of nationalism"" as Mr Blair does, will not reach the central belt of Scotland, the middle ground of  Midlothian.What about that purple pachyderm?  In Crawley - in fact in seat after seat - there is a similar pattern.  Labour did, in fact, often increase the size of their vote. So did the Conservatives, usually by a bit more. But the real dynamic was the total collapse of the Lib Dems and the dramatic rise of UKIP. The increase in votes for Nigel Farage's party wasn't translated into parliamentary seats, but, although it is early days in terms of research, it probably hurt Labour a lot. If we believe - and I do - Matthew Goodwin and Rob Ford, authors of Revolt on the Right, these voters are often former Labour supporters - older, less educated, those left behind on the tides of  globalisation, stranded on the shores of post-industrialisation. They may have had too many disappointments to feel much ambition or aspiration. They are a challenge for Labour, and any new leader will spend a good deal of time thinking how to deal with the concerns of Europe and immigration.Whether to share their fears, or confront them will be a big decision.Which brings us to Red Nellie. Those members who still proudly call themselves socialist. This is not about Old Labour - they are more likely to be baristas or barristers than boilermakers. It is easy as an outsider, as a journalist, to treat politics as an intellectual game about how best to win power - but many people, particularly the foot soldiers, particularly after the death of  purely tribal loyalties, are in it because they passionately believe in winning  power to do something specific.Many of them are suspicious of the later incarnations of New Labour, not because it reached an accommodation with wealth and business, but because it seemed to worship at the same altar, to regard the party's core beliefs in redistribution and equality as childish fantasies from a past age.Perhaps to Mr Blair, they are the problem, people who may equate ""ambition"" with greed. They might point out that a man who claims to be worth ""only"" £20m may find it harder than most to squeeze through the eye of a needle to understand their point of view. Most successful Labour leaders will confront the left at some point, but the concerns of this group go to the existential question ""What is the party for?""This is not a polemic - not an argument about what should be done, but a reflection on the complex conundrums that will face any new Labour leader, the tearing apart of the old alliance that made up a Labour majority, and so the political need to satisfy groups with very different, indeed, contradictory demands. But looking for a Social Democratic universal theory of everything may be missing the point. What the party desperately wants is a leader who can pull the disparate threads together and articulate them as common purpose. Whether she or he exists is another matter.Much more on that in the coming months."
2015-04-26,'Take us with you',https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-32736153,"Thousands of people in the north of England have been using the hashtag ""take us with you Scotland"" to express their upset about the result of last week's general election, and Scottish nationalists are welcoming this English minority with open arms. Last Thursday's general election was a rough one for the Labour Party in its traditional stronghold in the north of England. But further to the north, the left-leaning Scottish National Party won nearly every seat it contested. That political contrast has made some left-wing voters in places like Manchester, Leeds and Sheffield look fondly on their neighbours. Since last Thursday's election in Britain the phrase ""take us with you Scotland"" has been used more than 24,000 times. ""Genuinely beginning to wonder if the North of England becoming a part of Scotland would be better for us, I really am,"" tweeted Aaron Miller from Yorkshire. Some cracked jokes under the tag after the North West Motorway Police account, which gives traffic updates, announced that they had ""picked up a pedestrian on the M62 who was trying to walk to Scotland.""After an initial spike of jokes over the weekend, the hashtag really took off when users start to mobilise in support of around a year-old petition on the campaigning site Change.org. The petition calls for the north of England to secede from the rest of the country and join up with Scotland, and more than 12,000 people have signed it.Its creator, a Sheffield resident who calls himself ""Stu Dent"", set it up to coincide with last year's Scottish independence referendum, and he also created a map imagining the boundary of a ""Scotland plus the north"" country.Stu Dent runs the Twitter account Hunters Bar, named after an area of southwest Sheffield which is very popular with - you guessed it - students. Despite the account having thousands of followers on Twitter, when the map was first posted last year, the image was shared only about 100 times - however, in the past week it's been retweeted by thousands. Stu Dent told BBC Trending that he was surprised at how popular his idea has become. ""In hindsight, perhaps I shouldn't have been,"" he said. ""There is a huge frustration in parts of the UK about the things that have happened since 2010.""""I think people need a place to go where they can say 'not in my name! This is not the England I want',"" he added. But in addition to disappointment from some quarters about the election result, there might be another reason why the petition is getting a boost now: the power of the Scottish Nationalists on Twitter. What started as a post-election joke in the North of England was quickly embraced by the so-called ""Cyber Nats"" - and a trend was born.The SNP's social media strategist Ross Colquhoun expressed the party's mood about the hashtag best, in a post which was shared more than 500 times. ""2014: #LetsStayTogether 2015: #TakeUsWithYouScotland What a difference a year makes"" he tweeted.Blog by Hannah HendersonNext story: The sport reporter and the obscene ranter who lost his jobFollow BBC Trending on Twitter @BBCtrending, and find us on Facebook."
2015-04-26,What Britain wants from Europe,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32695399,"David Cameron says he has a mandate to pursue EU reform following the Conservatives' general election victory. The PM, who will be hoping his majority government will give him extra leverage in Brussels, wants to renegotiate the terms of the UK's membership ahead of a referendum by the end of 2017. He has said he will campaign for Britain to remain in the EU if he gets the reforms he wants.Mr Cameron has said he does not want to reveal full details of his negotiating hand but he has given a broad indication, in a series of speeches and newspaper articles, of his priorities when he goes into talks with other EU leaders.These are: The prime minister has said Britain would resist any move towards a European Army and that he wants to free British police forces from EU interference. He has also ruled out Britain joining the euro.But he has placed less emphasis in recent years on demanding changes to EU social policy, such as the maximum 48-hour working week, agency workers, maternity leave and non-discrimination rules.The official UK government position is that a referendum will be held by the end of 2017 but Downing Street sources have said: ""If we can do it earlier we will.""There is speculation David Cameron is planning to hold the vote in 2016 to avoid a clash with French and German elections in 2017.The prime minister wants treaty change but even if the referendum was held in 2017 there may not be enough time to legally incorporate any reforms into a treaty and it would have to be done at a later stage.An early referendum would anger Eurosceptics who believe it would not allow enough time to make the case for exit or negotiate any meaningful concessions.""A rushed process would severely undermine the chances to secure a significant deal that both British business and voters could support and would waste the opportunity of a lifetime,"" Matthew Elliott, chief executive of Business for Britain told Breitbart London.The question is always crucial in any referendum and there is already a debate about what it should be. The Draft European Union (Referendum) Bill, published by the Conservatives in 2013, proposed this form of words: ""Do you think that the United Kingdom should remain a member of the European Union?""Some thought that leaned too far towards the status quo, encouraging a yes vote, and the Electoral Commission said it was not clear and direct enough. The watchdog proposed this form of words instead: ""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union?""The new Conservative government will attempt to repeal the Human Rights Act, which requires UK courts to treat the European Court of Human Rights as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. The European Court of Human Rights is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe (CoE), which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine.The freedom for people to move around Europe, enshrined in the EU treaties, works in parallel with the other three basic freedoms in the single market: freedom of goods, capital and services.It is likely to be a ""red line"" for other EU leaders, who do not want to see it eroded.Mr Cameron has steered clear of tackling it directly - for example by asking for an emergency ""brake"" on free movement, or a cap on numbers - focusing instead on reducing the incentive provided by welfare payments. In a speech last November, David Cameron set out measures to reduce the number of EU nationals moving to the UK.His main proposals were:Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission, has said he is ready to work with Mr Cameron to ""strike a fair deal for the United Kingdom in the EU"". The leaders of other EU nations have previously warned they are unlikely to support major changes to EU treaties to accommodate British demands. But Mr Cameron's general election victory may have given him extra leverage. ""The ball is very much in the court of the UK now,"" a senior EU official told The Guardian. ""It's up to the British to define what they want."" The key figure will be German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is very keen to keep Britain in the EU but has so far been unwilling to make major concessions to enable that to happen. There are fears that a ""pick and mix"" approach to EU treaties would undermine EU cohesion.Mr Cameron has said there is ""no doubt"" his planned reforms will require changes to the treaties governing the European Union. But this would require the unanimous support of all EU members, and may not be possible within the deadline he has set of a referendum before the end of 2017. Any attempt to change EU laws on free movement would meet fierce resistance from some EU nations, particularly Eastern European states. Mr Juncker has said free movement is non-negotiable.Mr Cameron may find it difficult to get unanimous support for his proposals for a four-year waiting period for migrant workers claiming UK benefits. East European EU members would be likely to oppose this, on the grounds that it would discriminate against their citizens.  Attempts to secure opt-outs for the City are unlikely to go down well with other European leaders.However, there are precedents for EU treaty changes to accommodate some countries' specific concerns - for example, the protocol attached to the Lisbon Treaty for Ireland.Mr Cameron has faced repeated calls to say whether he would campaign for Britain's exit from the EU in the referendum if he fails to get what he wants from the renegotiation process. All he has said is that he will ""rule nothing out"". Some Conservative MPs want Britain to leave the EU no matter what David Cameron manages to renegotiate. A larger group are likely to want more concessions than Mr Cameron has so far indicated he is prepared to demand.Senior backbencher David Davis, who was defeated by Mr Cameron for the Tory leadership in 2005, told the Daily Telegraph the majority of the 332 Conservative MPs want Mr Cameron to negotiate an ""opt-out"" power to stop individual EU laws from applying to Britain. The prime minister has said this would be ""impossible"" without Britain leaving the EU.Mr Davis claims as many as 60 Tory MPs would be prepared to rebel and vote for Britain's exit from the EU if the prime minister fails to deliver.Graham Brady, chairman of the Tory backbench 1922 committee, which represents backbenchers, has urged David Cameron to give all Conservative MPs, including ministers, a free vote in the EU referendum.In January, Mr Cameron warned that serving cabinet ministers would have to quit the government if they wanted to campaign to leave the EU if he had secured the reforms to it he wants.In the 1975 referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Economic Community, as the EU was then called, Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson decided to suspend collective responsibility because his cabinet was split on the issue. Ministers were allowed to vote with their consciences and campaign against each other. The majority of them, including Mr Wilson, joined the Yes camp, but left-wingers, such as Tony Benn, played a leading role in the No campaign. The Yes campaign won easily with 67% of the vote."

Mr Murphy said he would tender his resignation alongside a plan to reform the party.He lost his seat in last week's general election as the SNP won 56 of the 59 Scottish seats, leaving Labour with a single MP in Scotland.Mr Murphy said he wanted to have a successor as leader in place by the summer, and confirmed he would not be standing for a seat at the Scottish Parliament in next year's election. Instead, he said it was time to ""do something else"" and that he believed the party would continue to be divided if he remained as leader. His deputy, Kezia Dugdale MSP, will become acting leader until a permanent successor is found. Mr Murphy had faced calls to resign from several MSPs, trade unions and former MPs in the wake of his party's near wipeout at the general election.He insisted he had decided to stand down ahead of the national executive voting by 17-14 in favour of him staying in the job.Speaking at a media conference after the national executive meeting, he said: ""It is clear that a small minority who didn't accept my election as leader of the Scottish Labour Party just five months ago won't accept the vote of the executive today and that will continue to divide the party.""Today I received more support in the executive vote than I did from members of the executive when I stood for election five months ago.""He said it would be up to the executive whether to accept the reforms he would be proposing before he left the post. But he warned: ""A party in such urgent need of reform blocks those changes at its peril.""The former East Renfrewshire MP said Labour had been crushed between ""two nationalisms"" in Scotland and England.Mr Murphy said he left no legacy of bitterness for anyone in the Labour Party, and the only person he was angry at was the person who blamed Scottish Labour for the party's UK-wide general election defeat - a reference to Unite leader Len McCluskey.And he said that in many ways Scottish Labour was the ""least modernised part of the Labour movement"" and that he wanted his successor to be elected under a one member, one vote system.Mr Murphy added: ""The Labour Party's problem is not the link with trade unions, or even the relationship with Unite members - far from it. It is the destructive behaviour of one high profile trade unionist.""The leader of the Scottish Labour Party doesn't serve at the grace of Len McCluskey, and the next leader of the UK Labour Party should not be picked by Len McCluskey.""Mr McCluskey has been a vocal critic of Mr Murphy's leadership and opposed his appointment in December when Mr Murphy won the contest to replace Johann Lamont.Jim Murphy laughed and joked with Scottish Labour's sole MP as he made his way down the hotel corridor to announce his resignation.He certainly brought energy and dynamism to his election campaign - but all that achieved was Ian Murray in Edinburgh South.So as Mr Murphy bows out, who could replace him?The deputy leader Kezia Dugdale may want to step up or Neil Findlay could try again after challenging last time. Maybe the party's finance spokeswoman Jackie Baillie thinks her steady hand could steer the ship.Jenny Marra is also often talked about as future face of the party.Whoever steps into Jim Murphy's red shoes he or she will have to face a difficult 2016 Holyrood election, to put it mildly.There are also more fundamental questions about how the party can possibly move on as it faces a surging SNP.Mr Murphy was very much a creature of ""New Labour"" - but to today's generation that's old Labour.Party members may start looking for someone with no links to the past, neither a Brownite nor a Blairite. A 'cleanskin' - as the politicos put it - may well help re-connect with voters.That's a long way from now though - even some of the party's opponents may view this latest train wreck with a modicum of sympathy. Ms Lamont had resigned after claiming Scottish Labour was treated like a ""branch office"" by the London-based party leadership.Mr Murphy concluded his speech by saying: ""Scotland needs a strong Labour party; Scotland needs a united Labour party. We have been the greatest force for change in our nation's remarkable history. ""The Scottish Labour party will rise again. It will be under someone else's leadership and I am confident about my party's future.""Harriet Harman MP, acting leader of the UK Labour Party, said it would be for Scottish Labour to choose a new leader. She added: ""As a cabinet minister and leader of his party in Scotland, Jim has been a hugely important figure in the Labour Party. He leaves with the best wishes and thanks of our movement.""Labour peer Lord McConnell, a former Scottish first minister, said the party's problems were ""much deeper than one individual and one affiliate"".He said: ""We have a disconnect locally and nationally with wider Scottish society. ""We have a problem with our political positioning in the post devolution age where the party particularly at the UK level has never been comfortable with success in the Scottish parliament and has always tried to see things through a UK prism rather than a Scottish prism.""We need to find a new generation, a new leader, new generation, new ideas, a fresh approach.""In a tweet, Scottish first minister and SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said: ""I wish Jim Murphy all the very best for the future. Leadership is not easy and he deserves credit for standing up for what he believes in.""Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson also reacted on Twitter, saying: ""Jim Murphy announces a managed exit in order to help the party, which is to his credit. But leaves a tough gig for whoever comes next.""The meeting of Scottish Labour's executive was disrupted by protesters who entered the party's headquarters.Police were called and the protesters, who included persistent anti-austerity activists Sean Clerkin and Piers Doughty-Brown, left the building to protest further from the street outside.The protesters were calling for Mr Murphy to remain as leader to ""finish the job of destroying Scottish Labour"".A Police Scotland spokeswoman said officers had been called and found two protestors on the third floor of the building. She added: ""Both left on police arrival. Advice and assistance was given."""
2015-04-27,Labour contenders clash on spending,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32761561,"Prospective Labour leaders have clashed over Labour's record in government in their first public debate in the race to succeed Ed Miliband.Former cabinet ministers including Yvette Cooper and Andy Burnham defended Labour's fiscal record and spending on schools and hospitals.However, candidates from the 2010 intake of MPs argued that the party spent too much while in office.The debate followed Chuka Umunna's withdrawal from the leadership contest.The remaining candidates appeared at the annual conference of the Progress think tank in London.There was agreement that Labour needed to demonstrate economic credibility to regain power, with shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt telling the meeting that the party needed to be ""trusted with public finances and the family finances"".Mr Hunt, who was first elected to Parliament in 2010 when Labour lost power, argued the last Labour government ""spent too much"" and failed to ""leave enough economic headroom to deal with the economic crisis and the recession"".Shadow health minister Liz Kendall said: ""There's absolutely nothing progressive about spending more on debt interest payments than on educating our children.""But shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: ""The Tories have had a triumph of spin over the facts in saying what they said about the economic record of the last Labour government.""The former chief secretary to the Treasury said the deficit did ""grow too large"" in the government's later years but insisted: ""The last Labour government ran more surpluses in its first term than the Tories did in 18 years.""Yvette Cooper, another former chief secretary to the Treasury, said: ""We should never let anybody tell us that it was too many teachers, doctors or nurses that caused Lehman Brothers bank in New York to crash.""Shadow international development secretary Mary Creagh said: ""People have forgotten the economic credibility that the last Labour government had.""She said Labour had built schools and hospitals that were ""treasured in our communities"".Ms Cooper, Mr Burnham, Ms Kendall and Ms Creagh have declared their intention to run for leader, while Mr Hunt told the conference he would make an announcement next week.At the same event, shadow energy secretary Caroline Flint announced she would be running for deputy leader.The Don Valley MP told the Today programme ahead of the debate that Labour lost the election because ""fundamentally the public did not trust us on the economy"".Exeter MP Ben Bradshaw has already announced a bid to be deputy, saying Labour ""must and could win the next election"", but only if it ""broadens its appeal by adopting sensible, centre-left politics which celebrate wealth creation and entrepreneurship"".Former Labour campaign co-ordinator Tom Watson is reported to be crowd-funding a deputy leadership bid, while Walthamstow MP Stella Creasy has said she is ""open to the question"" of running.Barnsley East MP and shadow transport secretary Michael Dugher - a fierce critic of Ed Miliband's election campaign - is to run Mr Burnham's campaign, according to the website LabourList.It is reported that Mr Burnham also has the backing of Labour peer Lord Falconer, who was lord chancellor and justice secretary under Tony Blair and was close to the former PM.Shadow culture secretary Chris Bryant has signalled his backing for Ms Cooper, tweeting that the next leader must be ""someone who's been tried in the fiery furnace of public opinion"".Mr Hunt said on Friday he would be be attending the debate - along with the other four hopefuls - to ""set out my analysis on how we begin to understand what went so wrong and why"".He added: ""We must use this leadership election to ask some very profound questions.""All voices in the party must be heard so that we can have a full and proper assessment as to why the politics of nationalism triumphed in Scotland and huge swathes of England, and how we have allowed the Conservative Party to present a more compelling vision for Britain to so many millions of people.""Speculation still surrounds shadow business secretary Mr Umunna's decision to pull out on Friday, when he said he was not ""comfortable"" with the ""pressure"" of being a candidate.As well as citing extensive pressure and scrutiny Mr Umunna also said he was ruling himself out because of concerns about the impact of the bid on his family.A rising star of the party, Mr Umunna was first elected to Parliament in 2010 - alongside Tristram Hunt and Liz Kendall - before joining the shadow cabinet.Asked about the candidate who might win, Conservative Chancellor George Osborne said: ""The Labour leadership contest has descended into farce.""But it's not actually about personalities. I don't think the Labour Party any more represents the working people of this country who aspire to a better life."""

I'm not suggesting he takes a break from being leader.""Clearly the national executive has the authority, they're the ruling body. ""I'm told that they made a decision. I'm told it was a procedurally correct decision, he is the leader but I think it's important that as leader he takes a break and I think it's important that we work out how these complex questions are answered by a team.""No one person has all the answers. I'm particularly concerned about tone, making sure we get a tone that ensures that the 27 million people who didn't vote for UKIP last week may be persuaded to vote for us in future.""The party has been beset by wrangling since Mr Farage agreed to stay on as leader, days after standing down after failing to get elected in Thanet South.He had pledged before the general election that he would quit the post if he failed to get elected to Parliament.Senior aide Matthew Richardson has left the party, following claims from MEP Patrick O'Flynn that Mr Farage had fallen under the influence of ""inexperienced"" advisers.UKIP has also confirmed the departure of Mr Farage's chief of staff Raheem Kassam.Mr Farage ruled out quitting as leader on BBC's Question Time on Thursday, saying he had ""phenomenal"" support, and has challenged his critics to decide whether they want to stay in the party.In his article, Mr Carswell had said that ""knowing how difficult it is to lead a party makes me admire Nigel Farage all the more"".""I know that I never could,"" he added, stressing that he would find it ""impossible to simultaneously lead UKIP, be the voice of the party in the Commons, represent my Clacton constituents and at the same time be a husband and a dad"".However, he said that ""even leaders need to take a break"", adding: ""Nigel needs to take a break now.""UKIP got nearly four million votes at the election, but returned only one MP - former Conservative Mr Carswell in the Clacton constituency."

Under the plans, ministers could force schools rated as ""requiring improvement"" and missing new government benchmarks to become an academy.Coasting schools have average results which have often flatlined over time.Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, Mrs Morgan said faster action was needed.She said: ""Our big priorities will be to speed up the process for tackling failing schools; extend our academies programme to tackle 'coasting' schools; and deliver on our commitment to open new free schools.""The proposals will be in a new bill due to be introduced in the Queen's Speech. ""First, we will take new powers to step in from the moment that a school is found to be failing,"" Mrs Morgan said.""From day one, regional schools commissioners will be able to bring in new leadership and support from other excellent schools and heads, and we will speed up the process of turning schools into academies to make sure that new expert leadership is found for all schools that need it as quickly as possible.""She said that coasting schools will be put on an immediate notice to improve and could then be taken over and turned into an academy.They will be required to work with a team of ""expert"" head teachers.She said: ""Those that aren't able to demonstrate a clear plan for improvement will be given new leadership - we know this works in turning schools around.""More than 3,300 schools in England are labelled ""requires improvement"", but the plans are unlikely to cover that many schools.Under the current system, secondary schools are considered to be failing, and therefore eligible for intervention, if fewer than 40% of their students score at least five Cs at GCSE, including English and maths, and they do not meet national averages in pupil progress.In primary schools, the threshold for intervention is if fewer than 65% of pupils get Level 4 in reading, writing and maths and a below average number of pupils make the expected amount of progress.It is not yet clear how coasting schools will be deemed in need of intervention.It is understood that a new category will be devised covering schools which are rated as ""requires improvement"" and which fail to meet a new set of standards on improvement."
2015-04-27,Co-op Group to keep political funding,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-32762858,"The Co-operative Group has decided to continue financially supporting the Co-operative Party, which has strong ties to Labour.Members of the group, the UK's biggest mutual organisation, voted on the issue at their annual general meeting.They passed a motion by 48,579 for, to 39,479 against, to approve ""political expenditures"" of up to £1m which support the movement's objectives.Last year the Co-op Group gave £625,000 to the Co-op Party.This figure was down on the sums donated in previous years. The AGM also included a vote on new corporate governance procedures which would mean members having less of a direct say.The Co-operative Group is still recovering from a period of financial mismanagement and some members have recently expressed concerns about how elections to the board are chosen.The banking arm of the group came close to collapse in 2013, bringing the whole group to a £2.5bn annual loss that year. The Co-op Party includes among its members a number of Labour MPs, including shadow chancellor Chris Leslie and Walthamstow MP Stella Creasy. The politicians stand as candidates of both the Co-operative Party and the Labour Party, and the two political movements have strong historical ties. The board asked the members of the Co-operative Group whether they wanted to continue financially supporting the Co-operative Party, or any other party. Allan Leighton, chairman of the Co-op Group, said: ""There's a clear remit from the members to continue to support the Labour Party.""It allows us to now have a conversation with the Co-op Labour Party about what we do next.""There was also a members' motion on the agenda, put forward by those in favour of making political donations of up to £1m a year.The motion to approve political funding ""not to exceed £1m per annum"" was carried by 55.17% to 44.83%.BBC business correspondent Joe Lynam said: ""To meet a £1.5bn hole in its accounts - mostly stemming from its banking division - the Co-op Group has had to sell off parts of its businesses and hand over majority control of its bank to American hedge funds.""It's also in the process of radically changing the way it runs itself into a more corporate structure with less of a direct say by its members.""He said that ""in theory"", each of the 2.8 million Co-op members could vote on a series of motions about the reforms, as well as how its bosses are paid, and retaining the links to the Co-operative party.One of the group's largest independent societies, Midcounties, recently threatened legal action over a shortlist of six candidates for the group's board being reduced to three - the number of positions available - before a member vote.

2015-04-27,Osborne plans July 'stability' Budget,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32761566,"Chancellor George Osborne has said that he will deliver a new Budget on 8 July.He claimed it would have ""a laser-like focus"" on raising productivity and living standards.He said he was making the unusual move of having a second Budget in one year in order to ""deliver on the commitments we have made to working people"".Labour said the chancellor would have to set out ""who is going to pay"" for what it called ""uncosted promises"" in the election campaign.Speaking outside 11 Downing Street, the chancellor gave a broad outline of his plans for the forthcoming Budget but refused to be drawn on the details, including the Conservatives' planned £12bn of welfare cuts.""I don't want to wait to deliver on the commitments we have made to working people,"" he said.""It will continue with the balanced plan we have to deal with our debts, invest in our health service and reform welfare to make work pay.""But there will also be a laser-like focus on making our economy more productive so we raise living standards across our country.""We're going to put Britain into good shape for the long term.""The last Budget was held on 18 March and included tax cuts for first-time house buyers.Writing in the Sun, Mr Osborne admitted it was ""unusual"" to have two Budgets in the same year, but he wanted to turn ""promises made in the election into a reality"".Again, Mr Osborne did not specifically outline how the Conservatives plan to fulfil a pledge to cut £12bn in welfare spending but said he wants to make the welfare system ""fair for the people who pay for it"".He writes: ""We will protect the NHS and give it more funding each and every year, while making savings across Whitehall. ""We'll crack down hard on tax avoidance and aggressive tax planning by the rich - because everyone should pay their fair share.  ""We will always protect the most vulnerable, but we also need a welfare system that's fair to the people who pay for it. If you can work you should be working, so we'll take the next steps in our benefit reforms to make sure that happens.""Second, we've got to go on helping businesses create jobs in Britain, so we move towards full employment. That means facing a hard truth: in Britain we produce about a quarter less for every hour we work than countries like America or Germany. Fixing that long-running productivity weakness is the big challenge for the next five years.""So in the Budget we'll spend less on welfare, and instead invest to create three million more apprenticeships, so that young people can learn a trade, get better jobs and earn more.""After the Budget in March independent forecaster the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said that Mr Osborne needed to spell out exactly how he plans to cut £12bn from welfare spending.Of those £12bn planned cuts, £2bn were outlined ahead of the general election - all the cuts are supposed to be in place by 2017-18.Labour's shadow energy and climate change secretary, Caroline Flint, accused the Tories of making ""a number of uncosted promises"" during the election campaign.She told the BBC: ""It will be interesting to see who is going to pay for those uncosted policies when they bring the Budget in July."""

If it isn't, stop it and do something else.""He also criticised Mr Farage's comments about HIV patients during the TV leaders' debate last month.While debating about the NHS, Mr Farage said: ""You can come into Britain from anywhere in the world and get diagnosed with HIV and get the retro-viral drugs that cost up to £25,000 per year per patient.""Mr Carswell wrote: ""By all means we should highlight the problem of health tourism. But we need to admit that using the example of HIV patients to make the point was ill-advised.""He said the party needed to strike ""the right tone"" and added: ""UKIP has been at its most persuasive when we have been most optimistic.""Anger is never a great way to motivate people - at least not for very long.""The party has been beset by wrangling since Mr Farage agreed to stay on as leader, days after standing down after failing to get elected in Thanet South.He had pledged before the general election that he would quit the post if he failed to get elected to Parliament.Matthew Richardson has left the party, following claims from MEP Patrick O'Flynn that Mr Farage had fallen under the influence of ""inexperienced"" advisers.

They absolutely loved how he helped them and he was a highly-regarded local MP,"" Mr Bone said.""He stood up for what was right rather than what the party line was. In those days - the John Major years - it was much more difficult to stand up against the party machine. He had strong views on Europe.""Sir Peter started his career as an insurance broker, joining the Wycombe Young Conservatives in 1949 and the Oxford University Conservative Association in 1951.He went on to become a Conservative councillor on Buckinghamshire County Council between 1961 and 1967.Wellingborough mayor-elect Barry Graves also paid tribute to Sir Peter, remembering him as a ""very strong constituency MP"".""I remember going out and canvassing with him and he would go everywhere. He knew the area and the people. He was very much a man of the local constituency.""He was ""a very approachable man"", Mr Graves added.Sir Peter was knighted in 1994. "

The Smith proposals included giving Holyrood the power to set income tax rates and bands, as well as control over a share of VAT and some welfare benefits. But Ms Sturgeon's SNP also wants the Scottish Parliament to be given powers over business taxes, employment law, the minimum wage and additional powers over welfare.Speaking after meeting Ms Sturgeon, Mr Cameron told the BBC: ""Let's make sure Smith is implemented in full. I'm going to keep the commitment I made to the people of Scotland. Let's get that done first because it does create a really strong Scottish Parliament.""He added: ""Of course, if people want to make future proposals I'll look at them.""The prime minister again said he did not support full fiscal autonomy for Scotland - the responsibility for all areas of tax and spending except defence and foreign affairs - stating that it would mean £7bn of cuts or extra tax-raising.What Nicola Sturgeon is trying to say is she has a mandate. She has 56 out of the 59 MPs elected in Scotland and she won 50% of the vote - unprecedented here in Scotland.She says that gives her leverage to push David Cameron. David Cameron says he wants to keep the nation together.The language coming out of Westminster last week was very much a cordial one. 'We will listen'.Nicola Sturgeon has warned him that if he doesn't listen, then the people of Scotland will judge him accordingly.Ms  Sturgeon described the hour-long talks at her official residence at Bute House as ""constructive and business-like"". She said Mr Cameron had made a ""commitment"" that the Smith proposals would be implemented ""as agreed"".""But secondly the prime minister agreed that he would look at proposals that we would now send to suggest the areas we can go beyond Smith,"" Ms Sturgeon said.""There was no agreement in terms of the substance of that but we will submit those proposals, the prime minister has said they will consider them and there will be a meeting to look at how we take that further forward.""Referring to her party's success in last week's general election, which saw the SNP win 56 out of 59 Scottish seats, Ms Sturgeon said: ""People in Scotland have now voted fairly convincingly for the SNP and sent a message that we want the Smith Commission proposals to go further and be built on.""The ball is in his court but I'm going into this in good faith.""She added: ""David Cameron and I are a world apart politically but, where we can, I'm determined to do business in the interests of the people of Scotland and across the UK.""She said she would have a ""constructive and business-like"" relationship with the prime minister. The two leaders shook hands on the front steps of Bute House as Mr Cameron arrived. Mr Cameron left the building shortly before 11:00, almost an hour after he had arrived.The two sides agreed to hold more regular discussions in the future, possibly quarterly. "
2015-04-27,Umunna withdraws Labour leader bid,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32748106,"Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna has withdrawn from the Labour party leadership contest, just days after throwing his hat into the ring.The MP, 36, said in a statement that he was not comfortable with the level of pressure and scrutiny that came with being a leadership candidate.Mr Umunna also cited concerns about the impact of the bid on his family.BBC political editor Nick Robinson said the MP's team insisted no ""unwelcome press story"" lay behind the move.But Mr Umunna had been shocked by the level of scrutiny of himself, his mother, sister and girlfriend, he said.You can follow the latest reaction here.A rising star of the party, Mr Umunna was first elected to Parliament in 2010 before joining the shadow cabinet.He confirmed his candidacy for the Labour leadership via a post on his Facebook page on 12 May, saying the party under Ed Miliband had failed to appeal to enough voters in England.But on Friday he said he had not found the leadership bid to be ""a comfortable experience"".I understand that Chuka Umunna has told friends that ""this is not right for me or people close to me. I'm human, the rest of my life is more important to me than politics.""The shadow business secretary has been distressed by the degree of scrutiny he, his family and his girlfriend have come under since he declared his intention to stand for the labour leadership.I am told that this includes reporters waiting outside the houses of relatives late at night.Friends of Mr Umunna deny that he is nervous of not getting the support of enough MPs to run for the leadership; they point out that he already has half the necessary names and that there are some weeks to go.The shadow business secretary now wants to play a leading role in arguing that Britain should stay in the EU and does not rule out seeking the leadership in the future.He said he thought he had understood ""the scrutiny and attention a leadership contest would bring"", but added: ""However, since the night of our defeat last week I have been subject to the added level of pressure that comes with being a leadership candidate.""The shadow business secretary said he had wondered if it was too soon for him to stand for the leadership, and ""I fear it was."" He also cited concerns about the impact on ""the rest of one's life"" and those close to him.""Consequently, after further reflection, I am withdrawing my candidacy,"" he said.Mr Umunna said he would continue to serve as shadow business secretary and hoped to ""play a leading role"" in Labour's campaign to keep the UK in the EU during the forthcoming in/out referendum.Commenting on the news, Labour former culture secretary Ben Bradshaw - who is expected to run for deputy leader - said Mr Umunna was a ""terrible loss"" to the field.He told the BBC's Daily Politics the Streatham MP had been the candidate the Conservative Party ""feared the most"".""And if it's the result of pressure on an extended family or an extended group of friends, I think that's a very sad reflection on our political culture,"" he said.Chuka Umunna feels ""liberated"", he told me, by his decision to quit the Labour leadership race.He hopes to be given a good role (shadow chancellor, I wonder?) by whoever becomes Labour leader. And I expect he'll become very high profile in the campaign to keep Britain in Europe, which is increasingly looking like it will be next May.He'll endorse a candidate in the next four weeks before nominations close. It will be very interesting to see who he piles in behind.Read more from Allegra (see post 13.23).Former Labour leader Lord Kinnock said he thought Mr Umunna had made the right decision.He said: ""If he felt in his soul that he wasn't prepared to subject himself - and more importantly his family - to the kind of attention which is fairly typical, sadly, these days, he has done absolutely the right thing.""There is no point at all in inflicting avoidable, unnecessary misery on those you love most.""Leadership contender Mary Creagh said she had ""huge respect"" for Mr Umunna, telling BBC Radio 4's World at One programme it took ""courage"" to withdraw from the leadership race.Mr Umunna was ""a big beast"" and would play a ""big role"" in the future of the Labour Party, she added.Yvette Cooper, Andy Burnham, Liz Kendall and Mary Creagh have already thrown their hats into the ring for Labour's top job while a number of other potential candidates, including Dan Jarvis, Alan Johnson and David Lammy, have ruled themselves out. Candidates must secure nominations from 34 colleagues - 15% of the party's MPs - by 15 June to make it on to ballot papers, which will be sent to members in August ahead of the leader's election a month later."

However, Mr Justice Stuart Smith at Southwark Crown Court said there was a ""very strong likelihood"" a custodial sentence would follow.The jury heard how Mote submitted numerous false expenses claims for payment for work that organisations had allegedly carried out on his behalf.Mote claimed the money was to pay whistleblowers in cash through third parties. He also said he had been ""targeted for being an anti-EU MEP.""During his time an MEP he also made £250,000 legitimate expenses claims.No date has been set for the sentencing."

2015-04-27,Round-up: BBC experts' analysis,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/election-2015-32650417,"The political future of the United Kingdom has become clearer after the results of the general election emerged around the country.David Cameron says he hopes to govern for all of the UK after the Conservatives took 331 seats - enough to form a slender majority in the Commons.Labour has been all but wiped out by the SNP in Scotland and suffered a disappointing set of results elsewhere, while the Lib Dems are left with just eight MPs after many party heavyweights such as Vince Cable and Danny Alexander lost their seats.So with battles won and lost and the fall-out and celebrations beginning, BBC correspondents examine the implications and challenges that lie ahead for the new government - and for those whose political careers have been ended by voters.No pollster, no pundit, no political leader saw it coming - not even David Cameron himself.Governing parties don't gain seats. Parties that have implemented painful cuts and are promising more certainly don't. Until that is the Conservative Party did - achieving what had seemed to be Mission Impossible - a Tory majority.Until that is David Cameron's personal triumph which triggered the near simultaneous resignation of his three principle opponents - Messrs Miliband, Clegg and Farage.They did so in part because they helped to crush their partners in coalition these last five years - reducing the Liberal Democrat parliamentary party to a size when it can fit into two London taxis and still have two seats to spare.In part because the extraordinary tidal wave of support for the SNP swept dozens of once safe Labour seats away.In part because Nigel Farage persuaded millions to vote for him but secured just one seat - not, though, the one he was standing in.Read more from Nick Robinson hereThe question uppermost in the prime minister's mind as he assembles his new government is how to keep the kingdom united.""Above all I want to bring our country together,"" he revealed after the result, ""to reclaim a mantle we should never have lost - the mantle of one nation, one United Kingdom"".Looking at the political landscape from Land's End today is very different to the view from John O'Groats.A sea of Conservative and Unionist blue dominates the scene across much of England, while a field of SNP nationalist yellow stretches to the horizon and beyond from the north.David Cameron's greatest challenge is to prevent the union he supports being torn apart by mutual resentment - resentment from Scotland at a Westminster government dominated by English Tories, and resentment from England at the preferential treatment people think is being given to the Scots.Those who assumed the future of the Union had been safeguarded by the Scottish referendum must think again.Read more from Mark Easton hereOne thing is rock-solid true: the Conservatives who worked on this campaign are as surprised by the result as the pollsters, pundits, politicians and general population.Maybe they shouldn't be - the economy is in good shape and the Conservatives had incumbency advantage.But when I travelled back from the prime minister's last rally with a group of exhausted Conservative campaign officials it was clear that 290 seats was a hoped-for target.No-one talked about anything over 300 seats, and no-one even mentioned an overall majority.So what special sauce pushed David Cameron into No 10 with a Commons majority?Mr Cameron had two simple messages in the campaign and he rarely veered away from them; the first - the economy is in good shape and the recovery is threatened by Labour. And the second - the SNP would hold a Labour-led government to ransom.Read more from Jonny Dymond hereBrian Taylor, BBC political editor, ScotlandOf all the comments on the overnight apocalypse, undoubtedly the most straightforward came from a defeated Scottish Labour MP.Since there were quite a few of them, let me narrow the focus a little. Come on down, Tom Harris.Mr Harris had plainly anticipated defeat. Nonetheless, he looked suitably lugubrious as his fate was confirmed.Why, he was asked eagerly, had Labour lost? ""Because we did not win enough votes.""Psephologically, it is perfect. Complete in itself. Psychologically, it sums up Labour's gloom without descending into subsidiary matters such as leadership, strategy and the rest. As a forward-thinking strategy, it is ideal. Win more votes. Simple.Read more from Brian Taylor hereThis has been an election which may have more profound consequences than almost any in living memory.We now face a generational decision about our future in Europe, with an EU referendum in two years' time almost certain.There will also be serious questions about the future of the Union, following an SNP landslide that has turned Scotland into a virtual one-party state.David Cameron's victory also represents a colossal achievement.Only once before in recent history has an incumbent government increased its majority - and that was Mrs Thatcher in her prime in the 1980s.It is also a significant personal victory for Mr Cameron and a rebuff for those in his party who had become increasingly sceptical about his ability to win.But while it may represent a defeat for those Tories who saw this election as a potential opportunity to rid themselves of David Cameron, he must now govern with a wafer-thin majority.For the SNP, their stunning victory can only increase the pressure on Nicola Sturgeon to include a commitment to a second independence referendum in her party's manifesto for next year's Scottish elections.It is an election which has not just defied all the predictions of the pollsters and pundits - but which may yet prompt the most fundamental re-casting of British politics for a generation.Read more from Norman Smith hereAfter an extraordinary night, some brief conclusions:Read more from James Landale hereIs this the end of the union?That is the question many people will be asking this morning after the party which has fought for Scottish independence for 80 years swept to victory.The answer from the jubilant Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon is a firm ""No"".She insists that her MPs will speak for all of Scotland, not just for the 45% who voted for the country to leave the United Kingdom last September.In the closing hours of the most extraordinary election campaign which anyone in Scotland can remember, Ms Sturgeon turned to talk of ""legitimacy.""That will be her watchword in the coming days as she argues that the prime minister cannot ignore the democratic will of the Scottish people.Politically, Scotland and England this morning look and feel like very different countries.Read more from James Cook hereAfter weeks of chatter about an election too close to call, it wasn't that close at all.David Cameron will be continuing as our prime minister.So, what is all this likely to mean?A referendum on whether the UK stays in, or leaves, the European Union, within the next two-and-a-half years.A race to be the next leader of the Labour Party.A race to be the next leader of the Liberal Democrats.And a huge new presence of Scottish National Party MPs at Westminster.And so here's another thing we know for certain this morning: Politics ain't going to be boring any time soon.Read more from Chris Mason hereFor Labour the story of their terrible night is rapidly turning into the search for a new leader. So who will that be?Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, is almost certain to run.  Even before this election, both he and another almost inevitable candidate, Chuka Umunna, had raised eyebrows inside the party at the work they had put in, preparing the ground with members and the unions for potential bids.Yvette Cooper, before the election, was still thought not to have made up her mind over whether to run. That decision has been made perhaps a little easier as her husband, Ed Balls, has lost his seat.She is certainly potentially in the frame, along with two lesser known names - Liz Kendall and Dan Jarvis - two MPs who were only elected in 2010 for the first time. This could be their moment. But whoever is in the job, they face a monumental task.Read Laura Kuenssberg's Twitter hereSterling is up (the most for seven years against the euro), share prices are up (especially bank shares like Lloyds and RBS, and energy shares such as Centrica), government bond prices are up.To state the obvious, investors love the Tories' general election victory.There are a few reasons.One (no surprise here) is that Labour's threat of breaking up banks and imposing energy price caps has been lifted.Second is that investors have been discounting days and weeks of wrangling after polling day over who would form the government - and so they are semi-euphoric that we already know who's in charge.Third, many investors tend to be economically conservative and instinctively Conservative.But although the City may be a bit drunk on the result, its pleasure in Ed Miliband's and Ed Balls' humiliation may be making it a bit blind - perhaps dangerously so - to some bumps in the economic road ahead.Read more from Robert Peston hereNigel Farage dreamed of holding the balance of power, but in the end his UKIP party is now worse off than when it came into the election.At the seventh time of asking he was rejected - this time by the people of Thanet South. It was a similar story in Rochester and Strood where Mark Reckless, who sensationally defected from the Tories last year, was also sent packing.In seats on UKIP's target list, like Thurrock in Essex, the party failed to make gains. In Grimsby - where Mr Farage went twice in the last six weeks - they came third.UKIP got around four million votes - with especially strong showings in north-east and south-east England - but it's ended up with just one MP, and a vacancy at the top. This has led to UKIP attacking the current system of choosing MPs, which it's described as ""busted"" and ""dysfunctional"".In one sense, this campaign was a complete failure and it's left an aftermath of angry voters, and others wondering if the UKIP bubble has burst.Read Robin Brant's Twitter hereI monitored 91 GB-wide voting intention polls during the 2015 election campaign and found nothing in them to prepare me for the final outcome.The good news for the pollsters was that their share for the Lib Dems was pretty close, as were the shares for UKIP, the Greens and the catch-all category of Others.The bad news for the polling industry was that the crucial shares for Conservative and Labour were the ones where they came most adrift.When all the qualifications of margins of error are allowed, there did appear to be a systematic overstatement of the Labour share and an equally systematic understatement of the Conservative one.It is for the pollsters to decide whether to conduct a review of their performance but I trust they will avoid the initial knee-jerk reaction of the immediate aftermath of the 1992 polls debacle.This general election performance follows the performance of the polls in the 2014 Scottish referendum where the choice was simply binary and yet all the polls were out by between 4-6%.Something is wrong. A lot of us would like to know what it is.Read more from David Cowling hereThe words ""political earthquake"" have been translated into numerous European languages, making front page news across the continent.While Britons now examine the domestic minutiae of the election result, here in mainland Europe the vote means one thing: a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU. And that has the potential to create an earthquake of its own.The guardian of the EU treaties Mr Cameron wants to change - Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker - has said again he'd listen to what Britain's new government proposed.Read more from Katya Adler here"

2015-04-27,A history of political plots,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32749971,"Nigel Farage has apparently seen off a challenge to his leadership of UKIP - a move described by his former election strategist as a ""coup"". He's not the only party leader to face an attempted ousting. But can you recover from such a revolt?In 2006, the Labour prime minister was the target of what became known as the ""curry house conspiracy"" - a coup to remove him and install his chancellor, Gordon Brown, as prime minister.It would lead to several of the plotters' resignations - but not Mr Blair's. However, it was successful to a degree in that it forced the party leader into naming a departure date.The move against him was reportedly masterminded by Tom Watson, a defence minister at the time, who was also rumoured to have had a secret meeting with Mr Brown on the eve of the revolt.Apparently, Mr Watson and three fellow West Midlands MPs - Sion Simon, David Wright (both ministerial aides) and Khalid Mahmood - met over a biryani at a Wolverhampton curry house to discuss the PM's future, before dispatching a missive calling for him to quit.The letter - which attracted the support of a number of normally loyal Labour MPs - was leaked to the press, and ultimately resulted in Mr Watson's resignation.In his parting letter, the West Bromwich East MP took a shot at the prime minister, who he said should step down in the interests of party and country.Mr Blair denounced his actions and branded the former minister ""disloyal, discourteous and wrong"", saying he would have sacked him if he had not resigned.But Mr Watson's departure was swiftly followed by the resignations of six other junior members of government - who had also signed the rebel letter - in protest at the prime minister's refusal to say when he would step down as Labour leader.The whole affair resulted in Mr Blair announcing his intention to step aside within 12 months - which he duly did, on 27 June 2007.But it did nothing to quash internal dissent and speculation in the party over the future leadership of the party.Labour prime minister Gordon Brown found his leadership under threat in 2009 after one of his cabinet ministers dramatically quit the government and called for him to resign.Work and Pensions Secretary James Purnell - a former aide to Tony Blair - resigned from his post after the polls closed in the local and European elections, in which Labour was forecast to do badly.Explaining his decision to quit, Mr Purnell said the prime minister made a Conservative victory ""more, not less, likely"".It was Mr Brown's first direct challenge from a cabinet minister - but it would not topple the Labour leader as senior members of government refused to follow Mr Purnell's lead.Mr Brown was safe for the time being. But several months later, in January 2010, a fresh leadership challenge was mounted by two senior former Labour cabinet ministers.Geoff Hoon and Patricia Hewitt wrote to all Labour MPs, saying the party was ""deeply divided"" over Mr Brown's leadership and that the best way to resolve the issue was by way of secret ballot.They insisted it was not an ""attempted coup"" but a necessary step to resolve divisions within the party.But the duo could only muster the public support of a handful of backbenchers long-opposed to Mr Brown, with the majority of the party's MPs less than impressed by the move, which came just weeks before the general election.As the day wore on, a succession of cabinet ministers came out to back the PM, suggesting there was little momentum behind the plot - although it was noted that several were not exactly gushing in their support of Mr Brown.As history tells us, neither leadership challenge bore fruit but they reflected the internal doubts and divisions over Mr Brown at the helm.As leadership toppling attempts go, this one in 2014 was regarded as a particularly ""botched"" and ""shambolic coup"". Indeed, former Lib Dem leader Lord (Paddy) Ashdown described the move as a ""plot of deep malice"".Its instigator, Lord (Matthew) Oakeshott - a close ally of the-then Business Secretary Vince Cable - tried to unseat Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg.The peer was found to have commissioned secret polls suggesting the party would do better at the 2015 general election without Mr Clegg in the driving seat.The man Lord Oakeshott had long had in mind to take Mr Clegg's place - Mr Cable, who was on government business in China at the time - was forced to publicly condemn his friend's actions and state his backing for Mr Clegg.But Lord Oakeshott said the business secretary had in fact known about his polls and their findings.Nevertheless, the peer - who was denounced by the Lib Dem leadership for spending money that could have been spent on campaigning - quit the party, and issued a warning shot on his way out about the Lib Dems' future prospects.Mr Cable largely emerged unscathed but he faced questions about his loyalty to the leader. Although the two sought to put paid to reports of a rift with a (painfully awkward, 'nothing to see here, folks') stage-managed pint in a pub.Although the revolt failed, and Mr Clegg remained at the helm, the Lib Dems did go on to suffer a trouncing at the general election, losing nearly 50 of its MPs - one of them, Mr Cable himself - prompting his leader to quit.The Conservatives have a reputation for being more ruthless than their party rivals when it comes to getting rid of leaders they sense are no longer effectual.But, in 1995, Prime Minister John Major - tired of persistent rumours of a leadership challenge - decided to take the bull by the horns and trigger a surprise leadership election to silence his detractors.His own backbenchers had questioned Mr Major's ability to unite and lead the party, which was deeply divided over Europe.So ""put up or shut up"", he told them as he tendered his resignation as Conservative Party leader but not prime minister.But then stepped forward eurosceptic MP John Redwood, who resigned from the cabinet in order to contest Mr Major's leadership.This was unexpected by many, as the PM had said there had been assurances from his cabinet that none would stand against him.But Mr Major went on to win the ensuing election with a comfortable defeat over his challenger, who was not included in the PM's consequent cabinet reshuffle.No further contested leadership election took place until after the Conservatives' defeat at the 1997 general election, paving the way for William Hague to take over the running of the party.Not all attempts to oust a party leader end in failure: as Margaret Thatcher found out to her peril.With three electoral victories under her belt, the Conservative prime minister's downfall would come at the hands of her own party - not the voters.It was on 1 November 1990 when Geoffrey (now Lord) Howe - one of Mrs Thatcher's longest-serving ministers - resigned over differences with the party leader over Europe.In his now infamous speech on the floor of the House of Commons, he attacked the PM's policies and leadership style, comparing being one of her cabinet ministers to opening the batting at cricket only to find his bat had been ""broken... by the team captain"".It sparked the beginning of the end of the 11-year Thatcher reign.Michael (now Lord) Heseltine seized on the opportunity to challenge the prime minister in the ensuing leadership contest, from which she would eventually withdraw and John Major emerge as her successor. Reflecting on the revolt and its implications on the Conservative Party, Baroness Thatcher's biographer Charles Moore wrote: ""Because the coup was unjustified, and so trust broke down, the politics of the next 15 years were those of civil war."""
2015-04-27,Election swings and roundabouts,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-32741924,"If election manifesto claims are all about smoke and mirrors, should we now add swings and roundabouts to the political metaphor?There's an intriguing aspect to the general election results in the Midlands that puzzled me.It's the striking contrast in the swings between Labour and the Conservatives.David Cameron and his campaign strategists knew they were home and dry when Nuneaton was the first Midlands marginal to declare.It was not only a Tory hold but a swing to the Conservatives from Labour of 3%.I was in the Nottingham suburb of Beeston awaiting the result of the Broxtowe count. Would its high profile Conservative MP Anna Soubry survive a red surge?Nuneaton set the pattern. Across the Midlands, both east and west, there was a uniform swing of between three and four per cent to the Tories - Warwickshire North 3%, Amber Valley 4%, Derbyshire South 4% and Sherwood 4%. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan topped the Tory swingometer in the Midlands marginals with 5% in Loughborough.Yet in the big cities, it was a very different story. The swing went to Labour.So in Nottingham East they enjoyed a 6% swing, Nottingham South 5.8%, Leicester South 7.3%, Leicester West 5%, Birmingham Hall Green 12%, Birmingham Hodge Hill 8%.If swings to Labour on this scale had gone beyond the city ring road roundabouts and into the suburbs, Ed Miliband would have become prime minister by now.In confidence, one senior Labour insider in Nottingham told me its success in the city wards was down to organisation, experience and its teams of activists.""We won the ground war. If Nottingham's city boundaries were extended into Sherwood and Broxtowe, we would have won those constituencies as well,"" he told me.Labour leadership candidate, Leicester West's Liz Kendall has identified her party's problem beyond the ring road roundabout.It's about reaching out to Middle England.""We need to show people that we understand their aspirations and ambitions for the future,"" she told the Sunday Times.The problem for Labour was that Middle England was not interested in what the party offered…and still isn't. The Cameron brand worked its magic in those Midlands marginals... it'll take something or someone special to break up that ballot box relationship."
2015-04-27,Royal 'lobbying',https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32740154,"Prince Charles sent 27 letters to then Prime Minister Tony Blair and members of his government between September 2004 and March 2005, ""despite the Freedom of Information Act!"" as the prince joked in one.But did his suggestions and concerns have any bearing on the behaviour of Mr Blair's government?The request: Prince Charles expresses his worries over an EU directive on complementary medicines ""which is… effectively outlawing the use of certain herbal extracts"".  Mr Blair replied, offering moral support and practical help. He agreed that ""the implementation as it is currently planned is crazy"" and set out an action plan that included delaying implementation for all existing products to 2011. What happened: Herbal products were not required to be authorised until 2011, just as Mr Blair had promised. Prince Charles continues to sell his own brand of complementary products, Duchy Herbals, through Boots and Waitrose. The request: Writing to Mr Blair, the prince expresses a ""growing sense of anxiety"" that the Hill Farming Allowance, which supports farmers working on Britain's uplands, could be scrapped. In his reply, the prime minister said he understood that the Hill Farm Allowance would continue until 2007. What happened: The allowance lasted until the end of Labour's tenure in 2010, when it was abolished.The request: Just 18 months after the US-led invasion of Iraq, Prince Charles raised the issue of poor performance of Lynx helicopters in high temperatures, saying: ""I fear that this is just one more example of where our Armed Forces are being asked to do an extremely challenging job (particularly in Iraq) without the necessary resources.""Mr Blair replied: ""On the subject of the Lynx helicopter, the limitations of the existing platform, particularly in the extremely challenging environment within Iraq, are well recognised by the Ministry of Defence."" He added that replacement of the helicopters would be a priority. What happened: Mr Blair's comments go much further than what he was saying about the subject at the time. In the event, though, the fleet was not fully upgraded until 2011.The request: Prince Charles lamented that the government's TB prevention plans might not ""include a commitment to deal with the badger problem in the immediate future"" and pushed strongly for a cull, saying: ""All I can say is that I do urge you to look again at introducing a proper cull of badgers where it is necessary.""Mr Blair sympathised, saying he could ""personally see the case for culling badgers"". However, he was unwilling to commit to a cull.  What happened: Culling trials were conducted from 1998-2005. The final results, published in 2008, said that the badger cull could ""make no meaningful contribution"" to curbing bovine TB. It wasn't until 2013 that a full culling programme began in two pilot areas. These ended with the conclusion that the pilots had been neither humane nor effective at curbing the spread of TB.The request: Then Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell wrote to Prince Charles to say she had decided to give parts of the historic Smithfield meat market Grade II listed status, and was trying to persuade deputy prime minister John Prescott to ""call in"" the planning application to prevent demolition of other parts of the site. She had been swayed by evidence provided by Sir Neil Cossons, who was English Heritage chair at the time, after he had been asked by the prince to add his support. Prince Charles replied that he was ""extremely glad to read of your appreciation of the value of this group of buildings"". According to the Guardian, market workers desperate to see the redevelopment of the site invited the prince to meet them to discuss it, but his office said he was ""unlikely to accept as he did not want to interfere in the planning process"".What happened: Smithfield market is still the subject of planning battles a decade on. Successive planning applications have been refused by ministers. Last year then Communities Secretary Eric Pickles rejected plans for an office development on the site, stating that ""the extent of damage that the application would cause to the important heritage assets at Smithfield runs entirely counter to national and policy objectives intended to protect such assets from harm"".In March, the Museum of London announced a move from its current Barbican site to the Smithfield market building."
2015-04-27,Election fallout,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32703139,"""Some of those gimmicks - that tombstone, whatever idiot thought that up I do not know!""I was talking to the former Mayor of Crawley in Sussex, John Mortimer, in the town's Labour Supporters Club about the vexed question of what went wrong, and where Labour should go next. This seat is one of those southern seats Labour hoped to take, but failed.I hear a whole range of views in the club.""They didn't give nothing to depend on, they should be clear, and a little bit more down to Earth."" ""Good party, wrong leader, they don't look after business enough.""Councillor John Stanley tells me: ""I think in a way we did go too left, but now we can go a bit centre-left, or centre, depending who the new leader is.""The former mayor sums up the mood on the doorstep: ""Whatever we told them, they didn't believe us.""  Expect to hear all those views, and more, in the coming leadership contest. Step back from the angst of supporters, and it may not be that hard to see why Labour failed.  An economic recovery, hailed by independent organisations as the result of government policy, undid a party that had loudly proclaimed for five years that the coalition's policies would lead to economic disaster. Combine that with an uncharismatic and uninspirational leader, then you might argue no further debate is necessary.Fat chance of that. Defeat breeds resentment, and this one has opened up old divisions.  A chorus of Blairties, led by the man himself, has declared that Ed's problem was ignoring those with aspiration and ambition, failing to appeal to those running business. Incidentally, I've been ticked off by the perspicacious editor of the New Statesman, Jason Cowley, for using the ""unhelpful"" term ""Blairites"".I can't think of another description that fits Tony, Lord Mandelson, Lord Adonis and David Miliband quite so well. But call them what you will, the message was clear - Ed was too left wing, Labour should move back to the centre, or, if you like, to the right.Reading Mr Blair's pithy analysis, listening to Lord Mandelson's gripping and savage eloquence, describing a party sent out to shout: ""We love the poor and hate the rich,"" and so ignoring the middle, and you realise strong emotions are in play.But back to the future may not be sufficient. Of course elections are won on the centre ground. But grandees grinding axes, affronted by the failure of boys who used to make their tea, may be creating so much noise that they can't hear more insistent sounds.  For there are several elephants trumpeting loudly as they cram into the small space of the shadow cabinet room. Imagine these beasts are as gaily decorated as Berlin buddy bears. One is decked out in red, another in imperial purple bunting, and another, a mammoth, strong tusked and ice rimmed, painted yellow with tartan trimmings.Take the last first. The Scottish wipeout is Labour's biggest problem. Fail to solve it, and Labour can forget ever having a comfortable majority again. It is hard to argue Labour were wiped out in Scotland because the SNP outflanked them to the right with their appeal to the business community and the ambitious and aspirational. But it is true the SNP drew in to people from left, right and centre, just as the modernisers say Labour should. It was the politics of economic self-interest, but cast in a very different light. Tribally sneering at ""the reactionary ideology of nationalism"" as Mr Blair does, will not reach the central belt of Scotland, the middle ground of  Midlothian.What about that purple pachyderm?  In Crawley - in fact in seat after seat - there is a similar pattern.  Labour did, in fact, often increase the size of their vote. So did the Conservatives, usually by a bit more. But the real dynamic was the total collapse of the Lib Dems and the dramatic rise of UKIP. The increase in votes for Nigel Farage's party wasn't translated into parliamentary seats, but, although it is early days in terms of research, it probably hurt Labour a lot. If we believe - and I do - Matthew Goodwin and Rob Ford, authors of Revolt on the Right, these voters are often former Labour supporters - older, less educated, those left behind on the tides of  globalisation, stranded on the shores of post-industrialisation. They may have had too many disappointments to feel much ambition or aspiration. They are a challenge for Labour, and any new leader will spend a good deal of time thinking how to deal with the concerns of Europe and immigration.Whether to share their fears, or confront them will be a big decision.Which brings us to Red Nellie. Those members who still proudly call themselves socialist. This is not about Old Labour - they are more likely to be baristas or barristers than boilermakers. It is easy as an outsider, as a journalist, to treat politics as an intellectual game about how best to win power - but many people, particularly the foot soldiers, particularly after the death of  purely tribal loyalties, are in it because they passionately believe in winning  power to do something specific.Many of them are suspicious of the later incarnations of New Labour, not because it reached an accommodation with wealth and business, but because it seemed to worship at the same altar, to regard the party's core beliefs in redistribution and equality as childish fantasies from a past age.Perhaps to Mr Blair, they are the problem, people who may equate ""ambition"" with greed. They might point out that a man who claims to be worth ""only"" £20m may find it harder than most to squeeze through the eye of a needle to understand their point of view. Most successful Labour leaders will confront the left at some point, but the concerns of this group go to the existential question ""What is the party for?""This is not a polemic - not an argument about what should be done, but a reflection on the complex conundrums that will face any new Labour leader, the tearing apart of the old alliance that made up a Labour majority, and so the political need to satisfy groups with very different, indeed, contradictory demands. But looking for a Social Democratic universal theory of everything may be missing the point. What the party desperately wants is a leader who can pull the disparate threads together and articulate them as common purpose. Whether she or he exists is another matter.Much more on that in the coming months."
2015-04-27,'Take us with you',https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-32736153,"Thousands of people in the north of England have been using the hashtag ""take us with you Scotland"" to express their upset about the result of last week's general election, and Scottish nationalists are welcoming this English minority with open arms. Last Thursday's general election was a rough one for the Labour Party in its traditional stronghold in the north of England. But further to the north, the left-leaning Scottish National Party won nearly every seat it contested. That political contrast has made some left-wing voters in places like Manchester, Leeds and Sheffield look fondly on their neighbours. Since last Thursday's election in Britain the phrase ""take us with you Scotland"" has been used more than 24,000 times. ""Genuinely beginning to wonder if the North of England becoming a part of Scotland would be better for us, I really am,"" tweeted Aaron Miller from Yorkshire. Some cracked jokes under the tag after the North West Motorway Police account, which gives traffic updates, announced that they had ""picked up a pedestrian on the M62 who was trying to walk to Scotland.""After an initial spike of jokes over the weekend, the hashtag really took off when users start to mobilise in support of around a year-old petition on the campaigning site Change.org. The petition calls for the north of England to secede from the rest of the country and join up with Scotland, and more than 12,000 people have signed it.Its creator, a Sheffield resident who calls himself ""Stu Dent"", set it up to coincide with last year's Scottish independence referendum, and he also created a map imagining the boundary of a ""Scotland plus the north"" country.Stu Dent runs the Twitter account Hunters Bar, named after an area of southwest Sheffield which is very popular with - you guessed it - students. Despite the account having thousands of followers on Twitter, when the map was first posted last year, the image was shared only about 100 times - however, in the past week it's been retweeted by thousands. Stu Dent told BBC Trending that he was surprised at how popular his idea has become. ""In hindsight, perhaps I shouldn't have been,"" he said. ""There is a huge frustration in parts of the UK about the things that have happened since 2010.""""I think people need a place to go where they can say 'not in my name! This is not the England I want',"" he added. But in addition to disappointment from some quarters about the election result, there might be another reason why the petition is getting a boost now: the power of the Scottish Nationalists on Twitter. What started as a post-election joke in the North of England was quickly embraced by the so-called ""Cyber Nats"" - and a trend was born.The SNP's social media strategist Ross Colquhoun expressed the party's mood about the hashtag best, in a post which was shared more than 500 times. ""2014: #LetsStayTogether 2015: #TakeUsWithYouScotland What a difference a year makes"" he tweeted.Blog by Hannah HendersonNext story: The sport reporter and the obscene ranter who lost his jobFollow BBC Trending on Twitter @BBCtrending, and find us on Facebook."
2015-04-27,What Britain wants from Europe,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32695399,"David Cameron says he has a mandate to pursue EU reform following the Conservatives' general election victory. The PM, who will be hoping his majority government will give him extra leverage in Brussels, wants to renegotiate the terms of the UK's membership ahead of a referendum by the end of 2017. He has said he will campaign for Britain to remain in the EU if he gets the reforms he wants.Mr Cameron has said he does not want to reveal full details of his negotiating hand but he has given a broad indication, in a series of speeches and newspaper articles, of his priorities when he goes into talks with other EU leaders.These are: The prime minister has said Britain would resist any move towards a European Army and that he wants to free British police forces from EU interference. He has also ruled out Britain joining the euro.But he has placed less emphasis in recent years on demanding changes to EU social policy, such as the maximum 48-hour working week, agency workers, maternity leave and non-discrimination rules.The official UK government position is that a referendum will be held by the end of 2017 but Downing Street sources have said: ""If we can do it earlier we will.""There is speculation David Cameron is planning to hold the vote in 2016 to avoid a clash with French and German elections in 2017.The prime minister wants treaty change but even if the referendum was held in 2017 there may not be enough time to legally incorporate any reforms into a treaty and it would have to be done at a later stage.An early referendum would anger Eurosceptics who believe it would not allow enough time to make the case for exit or negotiate any meaningful concessions.""A rushed process would severely undermine the chances to secure a significant deal that both British business and voters could support and would waste the opportunity of a lifetime,"" Matthew Elliott, chief executive of Business for Britain told Breitbart London.The question is always crucial in any referendum and there is already a debate about what it should be. The Draft European Union (Referendum) Bill, published by the Conservatives in 2013, proposed this form of words: ""Do you think that the United Kingdom should remain a member of the European Union?""Some thought that leaned too far towards the status quo, encouraging a yes vote, and the Electoral Commission said it was not clear and direct enough. The watchdog proposed this form of words instead: ""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union?""The new Conservative government will attempt to repeal the Human Rights Act, which requires UK courts to treat the European Court of Human Rights as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. The European Court of Human Rights is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe (CoE), which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine.The freedom for people to move around Europe, enshrined in the EU treaties, works in parallel with the other three basic freedoms in the single market: freedom of goods, capital and services.It is likely to be a ""red line"" for other EU leaders, who do not want to see it eroded.Mr Cameron has steered clear of tackling it directly - for example by asking for an emergency ""brake"" on free movement, or a cap on numbers - focusing instead on reducing the incentive provided by welfare payments. In a speech last November, David Cameron set out measures to reduce the number of EU nationals moving to the UK.His main proposals were:Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission, has said he is ready to work with Mr Cameron to ""strike a fair deal for the United Kingdom in the EU"". The leaders of other EU nations have previously warned they are unlikely to support major changes to EU treaties to accommodate British demands. But Mr Cameron's general election victory may have given him extra leverage. ""The ball is very much in the court of the UK now,"" a senior EU official told The Guardian. ""It's up to the British to define what they want."" The key figure will be German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is very keen to keep Britain in the EU but has so far been unwilling to make major concessions to enable that to happen. There are fears that a ""pick and mix"" approach to EU treaties would undermine EU cohesion.Mr Cameron has said there is ""no doubt"" his planned reforms will require changes to the treaties governing the European Union. But this would require the unanimous support of all EU members, and may not be possible within the deadline he has set of a referendum before the end of 2017. Any attempt to change EU laws on free movement would meet fierce resistance from some EU nations, particularly Eastern European states. Mr Juncker has said free movement is non-negotiable.Mr Cameron may find it difficult to get unanimous support for his proposals for a four-year waiting period for migrant workers claiming UK benefits. East European EU members would be likely to oppose this, on the grounds that it would discriminate against their citizens.  Attempts to secure opt-outs for the City are unlikely to go down well with other European leaders.However, there are precedents for EU treaty changes to accommodate some countries' specific concerns - for example, the protocol attached to the Lisbon Treaty for Ireland.Mr Cameron has faced repeated calls to say whether he would campaign for Britain's exit from the EU in the referendum if he fails to get what he wants from the renegotiation process. All he has said is that he will ""rule nothing out"". Some Conservative MPs want Britain to leave the EU no matter what David Cameron manages to renegotiate. A larger group are likely to want more concessions than Mr Cameron has so far indicated he is prepared to demand.Senior backbencher David Davis, who was defeated by Mr Cameron for the Tory leadership in 2005, told the Daily Telegraph the majority of the 332 Conservative MPs want Mr Cameron to negotiate an ""opt-out"" power to stop individual EU laws from applying to Britain. The prime minister has said this would be ""impossible"" without Britain leaving the EU.Mr Davis claims as many as 60 Tory MPs would be prepared to rebel and vote for Britain's exit from the EU if the prime minister fails to deliver.Graham Brady, chairman of the Tory backbench 1922 committee, which represents backbenchers, has urged David Cameron to give all Conservative MPs, including ministers, a free vote in the EU referendum.In January, Mr Cameron warned that serving cabinet ministers would have to quit the government if they wanted to campaign to leave the EU if he had secured the reforms to it he wants.In the 1975 referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Economic Community, as the EU was then called, Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson decided to suspend collective responsibility because his cabinet was split on the issue. Ministers were allowed to vote with their consciences and campaign against each other. The majority of them, including Mr Wilson, joined the Yes camp, but left-wingers, such as Tony Benn, played a leading role in the No campaign. The Yes campaign won easily with 67% of the vote."

2015-04-28,Scots Labour leader Murphy to resign,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32760196,"Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy is to resign next month, he has announced.It comes despite Mr Murphy narrowly surviving a vote of no confidence at a meeting of the party's national executive in Glasgow. Mr Murphy said he would tender his resignation alongside a plan to reform the party.He lost his seat in last week's general election as the SNP won 56 of the 59 Scottish seats, leaving Labour with a single MP in Scotland.Mr Murphy said he wanted to have a successor as leader in place by the summer, and confirmed he would not be standing for a seat at the Scottish Parliament in next year's election. Instead, he said it was time to ""do something else"" and that he believed the party would continue to be divided if he remained as leader. His deputy, Kezia Dugdale MSP, will become acting leader until a permanent successor is found. Mr Murphy had faced calls to resign from several MSPs, trade unions and former MPs in the wake of his party's near wipeout at the general election.He insisted he had decided to stand down ahead of the national executive voting by 17-14 in favour of him staying in the job.Speaking at a media conference after the national executive meeting, he said: ""It is clear that a small minority who didn't accept my election as leader of the Scottish Labour Party just five months ago won't accept the vote of the executive today and that will continue to divide the party.""Today I received more support in the executive vote than I did from members of the executive when I stood for election five months ago.""He said it would be up to the executive whether to accept the reforms he would be proposing before he left the post. But he warned: ""A party in such urgent need of reform blocks those changes at its peril.""The former East Renfrewshire MP said Labour had been crushed between ""two nationalisms"" in Scotland and England.Mr Murphy said he left no legacy of bitterness for anyone in the Labour Party, and the only person he was angry at was the person who blamed Scottish Labour for the party's UK-wide general election defeat - a reference to Unite leader Len McCluskey.And he said that in many ways Scottish Labour was the ""least modernised part of the Labour movement"" and that he wanted his successor to be elected under a one member, one vote system.Mr Murphy added: ""The Labour Party's problem is not the link with trade unions, or even the relationship with Unite members - far from it. It is the destructive behaviour of one high profile trade unionist.""The leader of the Scottish Labour Party doesn't serve at the grace of Len McCluskey, and the next leader of the UK Labour Party should not be picked by Len McCluskey.""Mr McCluskey has been a vocal critic of Mr Murphy's leadership and opposed his appointment in December when Mr Murphy won the contest to replace Johann Lamont.Jim Murphy laughed and joked with Scottish Labour's sole MP as he made his way down the hotel corridor to announce his resignation.He certainly brought energy and dynamism to his election campaign - but all that achieved was Ian Murray in Edinburgh South.So as Mr Murphy bows out, who could replace him?The deputy leader Kezia Dugdale may want to step up or Neil Findlay could try again after challenging last time. Maybe the party's finance spokeswoman Jackie Baillie thinks her steady hand could steer the ship.Jenny Marra is also often talked about as future face of the party.Whoever steps into Jim Murphy's red shoes he or she will have to face a difficult 2016 Holyrood election, to put it mildly.There are also more fundamental questions about how the party can possibly move on as it faces a surging SNP.Mr Murphy was very much a creature of ""New Labour"" - but to today's generation that's old Labour.Party members may start looking for someone with no links to the past, neither a Brownite nor a Blairite. A 'cleanskin' - as the politicos put it - may well help re-connect with voters.That's a long way from now though - even some of the party's opponents may view this latest train wreck with a modicum of sympathy. Ms Lamont had resigned after claiming Scottish Labour was treated like a ""branch office"" by the London-based party leadership.Mr Murphy concluded his speech by saying: ""Scotland needs a strong Labour party; Scotland needs a united Labour party. We have been the greatest force for change in our nation's remarkable history. ""The Scottish Labour party will rise again. It will be under someone else's leadership and I am confident about my party's future.""Harriet Harman MP, acting leader of the UK Labour Party, said it would be for Scottish Labour to choose a new leader. She added: ""As a cabinet minister and leader of his party in Scotland, Jim has been a hugely important figure in the Labour Party. He leaves with the best wishes and thanks of our movement.""Labour peer Lord McConnell, a former Scottish first minister, said the party's problems were ""much deeper than one individual and one affiliate"".He said: ""We have a disconnect locally and nationally with wider Scottish society. ""We have a problem with our political positioning in the post devolution age where the party particularly at the UK level has never been comfortable with success in the Scottish parliament and has always tried to see things through a UK prism rather than a Scottish prism.""We need to find a new generation, a new leader, new generation, new ideas, a fresh approach.""In a tweet, Scottish first minister and SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said: ""I wish Jim Murphy all the very best for the future. Leadership is not easy and he deserves credit for standing up for what he believes in.""Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson also reacted on Twitter, saying: ""Jim Murphy announces a managed exit in order to help the party, which is to his credit. But leaves a tough gig for whoever comes next.""The meeting of Scottish Labour's executive was disrupted by protesters who entered the party's headquarters.Police were called and the protesters, who included persistent anti-austerity activists Sean Clerkin and Piers Doughty-Brown, left the building to protest further from the street outside.The protesters were calling for Mr Murphy to remain as leader to ""finish the job of destroying Scottish Labour"".A Police Scotland spokeswoman said officers had been called and found two protestors on the third floor of the building. She added: ""Both left on police arrival. Advice and assistance was given."""
2015-04-28,Labour contenders clash on spending,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32761561,"Prospective Labour leaders have clashed over Labour's record in government in their first public debate in the race to succeed Ed Miliband.Former cabinet ministers including Yvette Cooper and Andy Burnham defended Labour's fiscal record and spending on schools and hospitals.However, candidates from the 2010 intake of MPs argued that the party spent too much while in office.The debate followed Chuka Umunna's withdrawal from the leadership contest.The remaining candidates appeared at the annual conference of the Progress think tank in London.There was agreement that Labour needed to demonstrate economic credibility to regain power, with shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt telling the meeting that the party needed to be ""trusted with public finances and the family finances"".Mr Hunt, who was first elected to Parliament in 2010 when Labour lost power, argued the last Labour government ""spent too much"" and failed to ""leave enough economic headroom to deal with the economic crisis and the recession"".Shadow health minister Liz Kendall said: ""There's absolutely nothing progressive about spending more on debt interest payments than on educating our children.""But shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: ""The Tories have had a triumph of spin over the facts in saying what they said about the economic record of the last Labour government.""The former chief secretary to the Treasury said the deficit did ""grow too large"" in the government's later years but insisted: ""The last Labour government ran more surpluses in its first term than the Tories did in 18 years.""Yvette Cooper, another former chief secretary to the Treasury, said: ""We should never let anybody tell us that it was too many teachers, doctors or nurses that caused Lehman Brothers bank in New York to crash.""Shadow international development secretary Mary Creagh said: ""People have forgotten the economic credibility that the last Labour government had.""She said Labour had built schools and hospitals that were ""treasured in our communities"".Ms Cooper, Mr Burnham, Ms Kendall and Ms Creagh have declared their intention to run for leader, while Mr Hunt told the conference he would make an announcement next week.At the same event, shadow energy secretary Caroline Flint announced she would be running for deputy leader.The Don Valley MP told the Today programme ahead of the debate that Labour lost the election because ""fundamentally the public did not trust us on the economy"".Exeter MP Ben Bradshaw has already announced a bid to be deputy, saying Labour ""must and could win the next election"", but only if it ""broadens its appeal by adopting sensible, centre-left politics which celebrate wealth creation and entrepreneurship"".Former Labour campaign co-ordinator Tom Watson is reported to be crowd-funding a deputy leadership bid, while Walthamstow MP Stella Creasy has said she is ""open to the question"" of running.Barnsley East MP and shadow transport secretary Michael Dugher - a fierce critic of Ed Miliband's election campaign - is to run Mr Burnham's campaign, according to the website LabourList.It is reported that Mr Burnham also has the backing of Labour peer Lord Falconer, who was lord chancellor and justice secretary under Tony Blair and was close to the former PM.Shadow culture secretary Chris Bryant has signalled his backing for Ms Cooper, tweeting that the next leader must be ""someone who's been tried in the fiery furnace of public opinion"".Mr Hunt said on Friday he would be be attending the debate - along with the other four hopefuls - to ""set out my analysis on how we begin to understand what went so wrong and why"".He added: ""We must use this leadership election to ask some very profound questions.""All voices in the party must be heard so that we can have a full and proper assessment as to why the politics of nationalism triumphed in Scotland and huge swathes of England, and how we have allowed the Conservative Party to present a more compelling vision for Britain to so many millions of people.""Speculation still surrounds shadow business secretary Mr Umunna's decision to pull out on Friday, when he said he was not ""comfortable"" with the ""pressure"" of being a candidate.As well as citing extensive pressure and scrutiny Mr Umunna also said he was ruling himself out because of concerns about the impact of the bid on his family.A rising star of the party, Mr Umunna was first elected to Parliament in 2010 - alongside Tristram Hunt and Liz Kendall - before joining the shadow cabinet.Asked about the candidate who might win, Conservative Chancellor George Osborne said: ""The Labour leadership contest has descended into farce.""But it's not actually about personalities. I don't think the Labour Party any more represents the working people of this country who aspire to a better life."""

I'm not suggesting he takes a break from being leader.""Clearly the national executive has the authority, they're the ruling body. ""I'm told that they made a decision. I'm told it was a procedurally correct decision, he is the leader but I think it's important that as leader he takes a break and I think it's important that we work out how these complex questions are answered by a team.""No one person has all the answers. I'm particularly concerned about tone, making sure we get a tone that ensures that the 27 million people who didn't vote for UKIP last week may be persuaded to vote for us in future.""The party has been beset by wrangling since Mr Farage agreed to stay on as leader, days after standing down after failing to get elected in Thanet South.He had pledged before the general election that he would quit the post if he failed to get elected to Parliament.Senior aide Matthew Richardson has left the party, following claims from MEP Patrick O'Flynn that Mr Farage had fallen under the influence of ""inexperienced"" advisers.UKIP has also confirmed the departure of Mr Farage's chief of staff Raheem Kassam.Mr Farage ruled out quitting as leader on BBC's Question Time on Thursday, saying he had ""phenomenal"" support, and has challenged his critics to decide whether they want to stay in the party.In his article, Mr Carswell had said that ""knowing how difficult it is to lead a party makes me admire Nigel Farage all the more"".""I know that I never could,"" he added, stressing that he would find it ""impossible to simultaneously lead UKIP, be the voice of the party in the Commons, represent my Clacton constituents and at the same time be a husband and a dad"".However, he said that ""even leaders need to take a break"", adding: ""Nigel needs to take a break now.""UKIP got nearly four million votes at the election, but returned only one MP - former Conservative Mr Carswell in the Clacton constituency."
2015-04-28,Coasting schools 'must improve',https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/education-32763097,"Education Secretary Nicky Morgan has said new powers to sack head teachers in coasting schools will show ""it is not OK to be just above the level of failing"". Under the plans, ministers could force schools rated as ""requiring improvement"" and missing new government benchmarks to become an academy.Coasting schools have average results which have often flatlined over time.Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, Mrs Morgan said faster action was needed.She said: ""Our big priorities will be to speed up the process for tackling failing schools; extend our academies programme to tackle 'coasting' schools; and deliver on our commitment to open new free schools.""The proposals will be in a new bill due to be introduced in the Queen's Speech. ""First, we will take new powers to step in from the moment that a school is found to be failing,"" Mrs Morgan said.""From day one, regional schools commissioners will be able to bring in new leadership and support from other excellent schools and heads, and we will speed up the process of turning schools into academies to make sure that new expert leadership is found for all schools that need it as quickly as possible.""She said that coasting schools will be put on an immediate notice to improve and could then be taken over and turned into an academy.They will be required to work with a team of ""expert"" head teachers.She said: ""Those that aren't able to demonstrate a clear plan for improvement will be given new leadership - we know this works in turning schools around.""More than 3,300 schools in England are labelled ""requires improvement"", but the plans are unlikely to cover that many schools.Under the current system, secondary schools are considered to be failing, and therefore eligible for intervention, if fewer than 40% of their students score at least five Cs at GCSE, including English and maths, and they do not meet national averages in pupil progress.In primary schools, the threshold for intervention is if fewer than 65% of pupils get Level 4 in reading, writing and maths and a below average number of pupils make the expected amount of progress.It is not yet clear how coasting schools will be deemed in need of intervention.It is understood that a new category will be devised covering schools which are rated as ""requires improvement"" and which fail to meet a new set of standards on improvement."
2015-04-28,Co-op Group to keep political funding,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-32762858,"The Co-operative Group has decided to continue financially supporting the Co-operative Party, which has strong ties to Labour.Members of the group, the UK's biggest mutual organisation, voted on the issue at their annual general meeting.They passed a motion by 48,579 for, to 39,479 against, to approve ""political expenditures"" of up to £1m which support the movement's objectives.Last year the Co-op Group gave £625,000 to the Co-op Party.This figure was down on the sums donated in previous years. The AGM also included a vote on new corporate governance procedures which would mean members having less of a direct say.The Co-operative Group is still recovering from a period of financial mismanagement and some members have recently expressed concerns about how elections to the board are chosen.The banking arm of the group came close to collapse in 2013, bringing the whole group to a £2.5bn annual loss that year. The Co-op Party includes among its members a number of Labour MPs, including shadow chancellor Chris Leslie and Walthamstow MP Stella Creasy. The politicians stand as candidates of both the Co-operative Party and the Labour Party, and the two political movements have strong historical ties. The board asked the members of the Co-operative Group whether they wanted to continue financially supporting the Co-operative Party, or any other party. Allan Leighton, chairman of the Co-op Group, said: ""There's a clear remit from the members to continue to support the Labour Party.""It allows us to now have a conversation with the Co-op Labour Party about what we do next.""There was also a members' motion on the agenda, put forward by those in favour of making political donations of up to £1m a year.The motion to approve political funding ""not to exceed £1m per annum"" was carried by 55.17% to 44.83%.BBC business correspondent Joe Lynam said: ""To meet a £1.5bn hole in its accounts - mostly stemming from its banking division - the Co-op Group has had to sell off parts of its businesses and hand over majority control of its bank to American hedge funds.""It's also in the process of radically changing the way it runs itself into a more corporate structure with less of a direct say by its members.""He said that ""in theory"", each of the 2.8 million Co-op members could vote on a series of motions about the reforms, as well as how its bosses are paid, and retaining the links to the Co-operative party.One of the group's largest independent societies, Midcounties, recently threatened legal action over a shortlist of six candidates for the group's board being reduced to three - the number of positions available - before a member vote.

2015-04-28,Osborne plans July 'stability' Budget,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32761566,"Chancellor George Osborne has said that he will deliver a new Budget on 8 July.He claimed it would have ""a laser-like focus"" on raising productivity and living standards.He said he was making the unusual move of having a second Budget in one year in order to ""deliver on the commitments we have made to working people"".Labour said the chancellor would have to set out ""who is going to pay"" for what it called ""uncosted promises"" in the election campaign.Speaking outside 11 Downing Street, the chancellor gave a broad outline of his plans for the forthcoming Budget but refused to be drawn on the details, including the Conservatives' planned £12bn of welfare cuts.""I don't want to wait to deliver on the commitments we have made to working people,"" he said.""It will continue with the balanced plan we have to deal with our debts, invest in our health service and reform welfare to make work pay.""But there will also be a laser-like focus on making our economy more productive so we raise living standards across our country.""We're going to put Britain into good shape for the long term.""The last Budget was held on 18 March and included tax cuts for first-time house buyers.Writing in the Sun, Mr Osborne admitted it was ""unusual"" to have two Budgets in the same year, but he wanted to turn ""promises made in the election into a reality"".Again, Mr Osborne did not specifically outline how the Conservatives plan to fulfil a pledge to cut £12bn in welfare spending but said he wants to make the welfare system ""fair for the people who pay for it"".He writes: ""We will protect the NHS and give it more funding each and every year, while making savings across Whitehall. ""We'll crack down hard on tax avoidance and aggressive tax planning by the rich - because everyone should pay their fair share.  ""We will always protect the most vulnerable, but we also need a welfare system that's fair to the people who pay for it. If you can work you should be working, so we'll take the next steps in our benefit reforms to make sure that happens.""Second, we've got to go on helping businesses create jobs in Britain, so we move towards full employment. That means facing a hard truth: in Britain we produce about a quarter less for every hour we work than countries like America or Germany. Fixing that long-running productivity weakness is the big challenge for the next five years.""So in the Budget we'll spend less on welfare, and instead invest to create three million more apprenticeships, so that young people can learn a trade, get better jobs and earn more.""After the Budget in March independent forecaster the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said that Mr Osborne needed to spell out exactly how he plans to cut £12bn from welfare spending.Of those £12bn planned cuts, £2bn were outlined ahead of the general election - all the cuts are supposed to be in place by 2017-18.Labour's shadow energy and climate change secretary, Caroline Flint, accused the Tories of making ""a number of uncosted promises"" during the election campaign.She told the BBC: ""It will be interesting to see who is going to pay for those uncosted policies when they bring the Budget in July."""

If it isn't, stop it and do something else.""He also criticised Mr Farage's comments about HIV patients during the TV leaders' debate last month.While debating about the NHS, Mr Farage said: ""You can come into Britain from anywhere in the world and get diagnosed with HIV and get the retro-viral drugs that cost up to £25,000 per year per patient.""Mr Carswell wrote: ""By all means we should highlight the problem of health tourism. But we need to admit that using the example of HIV patients to make the point was ill-advised.""He said the party needed to strike ""the right tone"" and added: ""UKIP has been at its most persuasive when we have been most optimistic.""Anger is never a great way to motivate people - at least not for very long.""The party has been beset by wrangling since Mr Farage agreed to stay on as leader, days after standing down after failing to get elected in Thanet South.He had pledged before the general election that he would quit the post if he failed to get elected to Parliament.Matthew Richardson has left the party, following claims from MEP Patrick O'Flynn that Mr Farage had fallen under the influence of ""inexperienced"" advisers.

They absolutely loved how he helped them and he was a highly-regarded local MP,"" Mr Bone said.""He stood up for what was right rather than what the party line was. In those days - the John Major years - it was much more difficult to stand up against the party machine. He had strong views on Europe.""Sir Peter started his career as an insurance broker, joining the Wycombe Young Conservatives in 1949 and the Oxford University Conservative Association in 1951.He went on to become a Conservative councillor on Buckinghamshire County Council between 1961 and 1967.Wellingborough mayor-elect Barry Graves also paid tribute to Sir Peter, remembering him as a ""very strong constituency MP"".""I remember going out and canvassing with him and he would go everywhere. He knew the area and the people. He was very much a man of the local constituency.""He was ""a very approachable man"", Mr Graves added.Sir Peter was knighted in 1994. "

2015-04-28,PM will 'look at' powers proposals,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32746049,"David Cameron has said he would ""look at"" any proposals for further powers for Scotland but wants to get the Smith Commission plans implemented first.The prime minister was speaking after meeting Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon in Edinburgh.Mr Cameron said he made a ""commitment"" to include a devolution bill in the Queen's Speech later this month.Ms Sturgeon argued the Smith Commission proposals were ""a good starting point"" but did not go far enough.The prime minister has pledged to include a bill on devolution in this month's Queen's Speech which would be based on the cross-party Smith Commission agreement. The Smith proposals included giving Holyrood the power to set income tax rates and bands, as well as control over a share of VAT and some welfare benefits. But Ms Sturgeon's SNP also wants the Scottish Parliament to be given powers over business taxes, employment law, the minimum wage and additional powers over welfare.Speaking after meeting Ms Sturgeon, Mr Cameron told the BBC: ""Let's make sure Smith is implemented in full. I'm going to keep the commitment I made to the people of Scotland. Let's get that done first because it does create a really strong Scottish Parliament.""He added: ""Of course, if people want to make future proposals I'll look at them.""The prime minister again said he did not support full fiscal autonomy for Scotland - the responsibility for all areas of tax and spending except defence and foreign affairs - stating that it would mean £7bn of cuts or extra tax-raising.What Nicola Sturgeon is trying to say is she has a mandate. She has 56 out of the 59 MPs elected in Scotland and she won 50% of the vote - unprecedented here in Scotland.She says that gives her leverage to push David Cameron. David Cameron says he wants to keep the nation together.The language coming out of Westminster last week was very much a cordial one. 'We will listen'.Nicola Sturgeon has warned him that if he doesn't listen, then the people of Scotland will judge him accordingly.Ms  Sturgeon described the hour-long talks at her official residence at Bute House as ""constructive and business-like"". She said Mr Cameron had made a ""commitment"" that the Smith proposals would be implemented ""as agreed"".""But secondly the prime minister agreed that he would look at proposals that we would now send to suggest the areas we can go beyond Smith,"" Ms Sturgeon said.""There was no agreement in terms of the substance of that but we will submit those proposals, the prime minister has said they will consider them and there will be a meeting to look at how we take that further forward.""Referring to her party's success in last week's general election, which saw the SNP win 56 out of 59 Scottish seats, Ms Sturgeon said: ""People in Scotland have now voted fairly convincingly for the SNP and sent a message that we want the Smith Commission proposals to go further and be built on.""The ball is in his court but I'm going into this in good faith.""She added: ""David Cameron and I are a world apart politically but, where we can, I'm determined to do business in the interests of the people of Scotland and across the UK.""She said she would have a ""constructive and business-like"" relationship with the prime minister. The two leaders shook hands on the front steps of Bute House as Mr Cameron arrived. Mr Cameron left the building shortly before 11:00, almost an hour after he had arrived.The two sides agreed to hold more regular discussions in the future, possibly quarterly. "

I'm human, the rest of my life is more important to me than politics.""The shadow business secretary has been distressed by the degree of scrutiny he, his family and his girlfriend have come under since he declared his intention to stand for the labour leadership.I am told that this includes reporters waiting outside the houses of relatives late at night.Friends of Mr Umunna deny that he is nervous of not getting the support of enough MPs to run for the leadership; they point out that he already has half the necessary names and that there are some weeks to go.The shadow business secretary now wants to play a leading role in arguing that Britain should stay in the EU and does not rule out seeking the leadership in the future.He said he thought he had understood ""the scrutiny and attention a leadership contest would bring"", but added: ""However, since the night of our defeat last week I have been subject to the added level of pressure that comes with being a leadership candidate.""The shadow business secretary said he had wondered if it was too soon for him to stand for the leadership, and ""I fear it was."" He also cited concerns about the impact on ""the rest of one's life"" and those close to him.""Consequently, after further reflection, I am withdrawing my candidacy,"" he said.Mr Umunna said he would continue to serve as shadow business secretary and hoped to ""play a leading role"" in Labour's campaign to keep the UK in the EU during the forthcoming in/out referendum.Commenting on the news, Labour former culture secretary Ben Bradshaw - who is expected to run for deputy leader - said Mr Umunna was a ""terrible loss"" to the field.He told the BBC's Daily Politics the Streatham MP had been the candidate the Conservative Party ""feared the most"".""And if it's the result of pressure on an extended family or an extended group of friends, I think that's a very sad reflection on our political culture,"" he said.Chuka Umunna feels ""liberated"", he told me, by his decision to quit the Labour leadership race.He hopes to be given a good role (shadow chancellor, I wonder?) by whoever becomes Labour leader. And I expect he'll become very high profile in the campaign to keep Britain in Europe, which is increasingly looking like it will be next May.He'll endorse a candidate in the next four weeks before nominations close. It will be very interesting to see who he piles in behind.Read more from Allegra (see post 13.23).Former Labour leader Lord Kinnock said he thought Mr Umunna had made the right decision.He said: ""If he felt in his soul that he wasn't prepared to subject himself - and more importantly his family - to the kind of attention which is fairly typical, sadly, these days, he has done absolutely the right thing.""There is no point at all in inflicting avoidable, unnecessary misery on those you love most.""Leadership contender Mary Creagh said she had ""huge respect"" for Mr Umunna, telling BBC Radio 4's World at One programme it took ""courage"" to withdraw from the leadership race.Mr Umunna was ""a big beast"" and would play a ""big role"" in the future of the Labour Party, she added.Yvette Cooper, Andy Burnham, Liz Kendall and Mary Creagh have already thrown their hats into the ring for Labour's top job while a number of other potential candidates, including Dan Jarvis, Alan Johnson and David Lammy, have ruled themselves out. Candidates must secure nominations from 34 colleagues - 15% of the party's MPs - by 15 June to make it on to ballot papers, which will be sent to members in August ahead of the leader's election a month later."

However, Mr Justice Stuart Smith at Southwark Crown Court said there was a ""very strong likelihood"" a custodial sentence would follow.The jury heard how Mote submitted numerous false expenses claims for payment for work that organisations had allegedly carried out on his behalf.Mote claimed the money was to pay whistleblowers in cash through third parties. He also said he had been ""targeted for being an anti-EU MEP.""During his time an MEP he also made £250,000 legitimate expenses claims.No date has been set for the sentencing."

Governing parties don't gain seats. Parties that have implemented painful cuts and are promising more certainly don't. Until that is the Conservative Party did - achieving what had seemed to be Mission Impossible - a Tory majority.Until that is David Cameron's personal triumph which triggered the near simultaneous resignation of his three principal opponents - Messrs Miliband, Clegg and Farage.   They did so in part because they helped to crush their partners in coalition these last five years - reducing the Liberal Democrat parliamentary party to a size when it can fit into two London taxis and still have two seats to spare. In part because the extraordinary tidal wave of support for the SNP swept dozens of once safe Labour seats away.In part because Nigel Farage persuaded millions to vote for him but secured just one seat - not, though, the one he was standing in.But - and this is critical - because Labour performed worse overall than it had under Gordon Brown in the immediate aftermath of the worst financial crisis of modern times.

2015-04-28,Round-up: BBC experts' analysis,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/election-2015-32650417,"The political future of the United Kingdom has become clearer after the results of the general election emerged around the country.David Cameron says he hopes to govern for all of the UK after the Conservatives took 331 seats - enough to form a slender majority in the Commons.Labour has been all but wiped out by the SNP in Scotland and suffered a disappointing set of results elsewhere, while the Lib Dems are left with just eight MPs after many party heavyweights such as Vince Cable and Danny Alexander lost their seats.So with battles won and lost and the fall-out and celebrations beginning, BBC correspondents examine the implications and challenges that lie ahead for the new government - and for those whose political careers have been ended by voters.No pollster, no pundit, no political leader saw it coming - not even David Cameron himself.Governing parties don't gain seats. Parties that have implemented painful cuts and are promising more certainly don't. Until that is the Conservative Party did - achieving what had seemed to be Mission Impossible - a Tory majority.Until that is David Cameron's personal triumph which triggered the near simultaneous resignation of his three principle opponents - Messrs Miliband, Clegg and Farage.They did so in part because they helped to crush their partners in coalition these last five years - reducing the Liberal Democrat parliamentary party to a size when it can fit into two London taxis and still have two seats to spare.In part because the extraordinary tidal wave of support for the SNP swept dozens of once safe Labour seats away.In part because Nigel Farage persuaded millions to vote for him but secured just one seat - not, though, the one he was standing in.Read more from Nick Robinson hereThe question uppermost in the prime minister's mind as he assembles his new government is how to keep the kingdom united.""Above all I want to bring our country together,"" he revealed after the result, ""to reclaim a mantle we should never have lost - the mantle of one nation, one United Kingdom"".Looking at the political landscape from Land's End today is very different to the view from John O'Groats.A sea of Conservative and Unionist blue dominates the scene across much of England, while a field of SNP nationalist yellow stretches to the horizon and beyond from the north.David Cameron's greatest challenge is to prevent the union he supports being torn apart by mutual resentment - resentment from Scotland at a Westminster government dominated by English Tories, and resentment from England at the preferential treatment people think is being given to the Scots.Those who assumed the future of the Union had been safeguarded by the Scottish referendum must think again.Read more from Mark Easton hereOne thing is rock-solid true: the Conservatives who worked on this campaign are as surprised by the result as the pollsters, pundits, politicians and general population.Maybe they shouldn't be - the economy is in good shape and the Conservatives had incumbency advantage.But when I travelled back from the prime minister's last rally with a group of exhausted Conservative campaign officials it was clear that 290 seats was a hoped-for target.No-one talked about anything over 300 seats, and no-one even mentioned an overall majority.So what special sauce pushed David Cameron into No 10 with a Commons majority?Mr Cameron had two simple messages in the campaign and he rarely veered away from them; the first - the economy is in good shape and the recovery is threatened by Labour. And the second - the SNP would hold a Labour-led government to ransom.Read more from Jonny Dymond hereBrian Taylor, BBC political editor, ScotlandOf all the comments on the overnight apocalypse, undoubtedly the most straightforward came from a defeated Scottish Labour MP.Since there were quite a few of them, let me narrow the focus a little. Come on down, Tom Harris.Mr Harris had plainly anticipated defeat. Nonetheless, he looked suitably lugubrious as his fate was confirmed.Why, he was asked eagerly, had Labour lost? ""Because we did not win enough votes.""Psephologically, it is perfect. Complete in itself. Psychologically, it sums up Labour's gloom without descending into subsidiary matters such as leadership, strategy and the rest. As a forward-thinking strategy, it is ideal. Win more votes. Simple.Read more from Brian Taylor hereThis has been an election which may have more profound consequences than almost any in living memory.We now face a generational decision about our future in Europe, with an EU referendum in two years' time almost certain.There will also be serious questions about the future of the Union, following an SNP landslide that has turned Scotland into a virtual one-party state.David Cameron's victory also represents a colossal achievement.Only once before in recent history has an incumbent government increased its majority - and that was Mrs Thatcher in her prime in the 1980s.It is also a significant personal victory for Mr Cameron and a rebuff for those in his party who had become increasingly sceptical about his ability to win.But while it may represent a defeat for those Tories who saw this election as a potential opportunity to rid themselves of David Cameron, he must now govern with a wafer-thin majority.For the SNP, their stunning victory can only increase the pressure on Nicola Sturgeon to include a commitment to a second independence referendum in her party's manifesto for next year's Scottish elections.It is an election which has not just defied all the predictions of the pollsters and pundits - but which may yet prompt the most fundamental re-casting of British politics for a generation.Read more from Norman Smith hereAfter an extraordinary night, some brief conclusions:Read more from James Landale hereIs this the end of the union?That is the question many people will be asking this morning after the party which has fought for Scottish independence for 80 years swept to victory.The answer from the jubilant Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon is a firm ""No"".She insists that her MPs will speak for all of Scotland, not just for the 45% who voted for the country to leave the United Kingdom last September.In the closing hours of the most extraordinary election campaign which anyone in Scotland can remember, Ms Sturgeon turned to talk of ""legitimacy.""That will be her watchword in the coming days as she argues that the prime minister cannot ignore the democratic will of the Scottish people.Politically, Scotland and England this morning look and feel like very different countries.Read more from James Cook hereAfter weeks of chatter about an election too close to call, it wasn't that close at all.David Cameron will be continuing as our prime minister.So, what is all this likely to mean?A referendum on whether the UK stays in, or leaves, the European Union, within the next two-and-a-half years.A race to be the next leader of the Labour Party.A race to be the next leader of the Liberal Democrats.And a huge new presence of Scottish National Party MPs at Westminster.And so here's another thing we know for certain this morning: Politics ain't going to be boring any time soon.Read more from Chris Mason hereFor Labour the story of their terrible night is rapidly turning into the search for a new leader. So who will that be?Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, is almost certain to run.  Even before this election, both he and another almost inevitable candidate, Chuka Umunna, had raised eyebrows inside the party at the work they had put in, preparing the ground with members and the unions for potential bids.Yvette Cooper, before the election, was still thought not to have made up her mind over whether to run. That decision has been made perhaps a little easier as her husband, Ed Balls, has lost his seat.She is certainly potentially in the frame, along with two lesser known names - Liz Kendall and Dan Jarvis - two MPs who were only elected in 2010 for the first time. This could be their moment. But whoever is in the job, they face a monumental task.Read Laura Kuenssberg's Twitter hereSterling is up (the most for seven years against the euro), share prices are up (especially bank shares like Lloyds and RBS, and energy shares such as Centrica), government bond prices are up.To state the obvious, investors love the Tories' general election victory.There are a few reasons.One (no surprise here) is that Labour's threat of breaking up banks and imposing energy price caps has been lifted.Second is that investors have been discounting days and weeks of wrangling after polling day over who would form the government - and so they are semi-euphoric that we already know who's in charge.Third, many investors tend to be economically conservative and instinctively Conservative.But although the City may be a bit drunk on the result, its pleasure in Ed Miliband's and Ed Balls' humiliation may be making it a bit blind - perhaps dangerously so - to some bumps in the economic road ahead.Read more from Robert Peston hereNigel Farage dreamed of holding the balance of power, but in the end his UKIP party is now worse off than when it came into the election.At the seventh time of asking he was rejected - this time by the people of Thanet South. It was a similar story in Rochester and Strood where Mark Reckless, who sensationally defected from the Tories last year, was also sent packing.In seats on UKIP's target list, like Thurrock in Essex, the party failed to make gains. In Grimsby - where Mr Farage went twice in the last six weeks - they came third.UKIP got around four million votes - with especially strong showings in north-east and south-east England - but it's ended up with just one MP, and a vacancy at the top. This has led to UKIP attacking the current system of choosing MPs, which it's described as ""busted"" and ""dysfunctional"".In one sense, this campaign was a complete failure and it's left an aftermath of angry voters, and others wondering if the UKIP bubble has burst.Read Robin Brant's Twitter hereI monitored 91 GB-wide voting intention polls during the 2015 election campaign and found nothing in them to prepare me for the final outcome.The good news for the pollsters was that their share for the Lib Dems was pretty close, as were the shares for UKIP, the Greens and the catch-all category of Others.The bad news for the polling industry was that the crucial shares for Conservative and Labour were the ones where they came most adrift.When all the qualifications of margins of error are allowed, there did appear to be a systematic overstatement of the Labour share and an equally systematic understatement of the Conservative one.It is for the pollsters to decide whether to conduct a review of their performance but I trust they will avoid the initial knee-jerk reaction of the immediate aftermath of the 1992 polls debacle.This general election performance follows the performance of the polls in the 2014 Scottish referendum where the choice was simply binary and yet all the polls were out by between 4-6%.Something is wrong. A lot of us would like to know what it is.Read more from David Cowling hereThe words ""political earthquake"" have been translated into numerous European languages, making front page news across the continent.While Britons now examine the domestic minutiae of the election result, here in mainland Europe the vote means one thing: a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU. And that has the potential to create an earthquake of its own.The guardian of the EU treaties Mr Cameron wants to change - Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker - has said again he'd listen to what Britain's new government proposed.Read more from Katya Adler here"

2015-04-28,A history of political plots,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32749971,"Nigel Farage has apparently seen off a challenge to his leadership of UKIP - a move described by his former election strategist as a ""coup"". He's not the only party leader to face an attempted ousting. But can you recover from such a revolt?In 2006, the Labour prime minister was the target of what became known as the ""curry house conspiracy"" - a coup to remove him and install his chancellor, Gordon Brown, as prime minister.It would lead to several of the plotters' resignations - but not Mr Blair's. However, it was successful to a degree in that it forced the party leader into naming a departure date.The move against him was reportedly masterminded by Tom Watson, a defence minister at the time, who was also rumoured to have had a secret meeting with Mr Brown on the eve of the revolt.Apparently, Mr Watson and three fellow West Midlands MPs - Sion Simon, David Wright (both ministerial aides) and Khalid Mahmood - met over a biryani at a Wolverhampton curry house to discuss the PM's future, before dispatching a missive calling for him to quit.The letter - which attracted the support of a number of normally loyal Labour MPs - was leaked to the press, and ultimately resulted in Mr Watson's resignation.In his parting letter, the West Bromwich East MP took a shot at the prime minister, who he said should step down in the interests of party and country.Mr Blair denounced his actions and branded the former minister ""disloyal, discourteous and wrong"", saying he would have sacked him if he had not resigned.But Mr Watson's departure was swiftly followed by the resignations of six other junior members of government - who had also signed the rebel letter - in protest at the prime minister's refusal to say when he would step down as Labour leader.The whole affair resulted in Mr Blair announcing his intention to step aside within 12 months - which he duly did, on 27 June 2007.But it did nothing to quash internal dissent and speculation in the party over the future leadership of the party.Labour prime minister Gordon Brown found his leadership under threat in 2009 after one of his cabinet ministers dramatically quit the government and called for him to resign.Work and Pensions Secretary James Purnell - a former aide to Tony Blair - resigned from his post after the polls closed in the local and European elections, in which Labour was forecast to do badly.Explaining his decision to quit, Mr Purnell said the prime minister made a Conservative victory ""more, not less, likely"".It was Mr Brown's first direct challenge from a cabinet minister - but it would not topple the Labour leader as senior members of government refused to follow Mr Purnell's lead.Mr Brown was safe for the time being. But several months later, in January 2010, a fresh leadership challenge was mounted by two senior former Labour cabinet ministers.Geoff Hoon and Patricia Hewitt wrote to all Labour MPs, saying the party was ""deeply divided"" over Mr Brown's leadership and that the best way to resolve the issue was by way of secret ballot.They insisted it was not an ""attempted coup"" but a necessary step to resolve divisions within the party.But the duo could only muster the public support of a handful of backbenchers long-opposed to Mr Brown, with the majority of the party's MPs less than impressed by the move, which came just weeks before the general election.As the day wore on, a succession of cabinet ministers came out to back the PM, suggesting there was little momentum behind the plot - although it was noted that several were not exactly gushing in their support of Mr Brown.As history tells us, neither leadership challenge bore fruit but they reflected the internal doubts and divisions over Mr Brown at the helm.As leadership toppling attempts go, this one in 2014 was regarded as a particularly ""botched"" and ""shambolic coup"". Indeed, former Lib Dem leader Lord (Paddy) Ashdown described the move as a ""plot of deep malice"".Its instigator, Lord (Matthew) Oakeshott - a close ally of the-then Business Secretary Vince Cable - tried to unseat Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg.The peer was found to have commissioned secret polls suggesting the party would do better at the 2015 general election without Mr Clegg in the driving seat.The man Lord Oakeshott had long had in mind to take Mr Clegg's place - Mr Cable, who was on government business in China at the time - was forced to publicly condemn his friend's actions and state his backing for Mr Clegg.But Lord Oakeshott said the business secretary had in fact known about his polls and their findings.Nevertheless, the peer - who was denounced by the Lib Dem leadership for spending money that could have been spent on campaigning - quit the party, and issued a warning shot on his way out about the Lib Dems' future prospects.Mr Cable largely emerged unscathed but he faced questions about his loyalty to the leader. Although the two sought to put paid to reports of a rift with a (painfully awkward, 'nothing to see here, folks') stage-managed pint in a pub.Although the revolt failed, and Mr Clegg remained at the helm, the Lib Dems did go on to suffer a trouncing at the general election, losing nearly 50 of its MPs - one of them, Mr Cable himself - prompting his leader to quit.The Conservatives have a reputation for being more ruthless than their party rivals when it comes to getting rid of leaders they sense are no longer effectual.But, in 1995, Prime Minister John Major - tired of persistent rumours of a leadership challenge - decided to take the bull by the horns and trigger a surprise leadership election to silence his detractors.His own backbenchers had questioned Mr Major's ability to unite and lead the party, which was deeply divided over Europe.So ""put up or shut up"", he told them as he tendered his resignation as Conservative Party leader but not prime minister.But then stepped forward eurosceptic MP John Redwood, who resigned from the cabinet in order to contest Mr Major's leadership.This was unexpected by many, as the PM had said there had been assurances from his cabinet that none would stand against him.But Mr Major went on to win the ensuing election with a comfortable defeat over his challenger, who was not included in the PM's consequent cabinet reshuffle.No further contested leadership election took place until after the Conservatives' defeat at the 1997 general election, paving the way for William Hague to take over the running of the party.Not all attempts to oust a party leader end in failure: as Margaret Thatcher found out to her peril.With three electoral victories under her belt, the Conservative prime minister's downfall would come at the hands of her own party - not the voters.It was on 1 November 1990 when Geoffrey (now Lord) Howe - one of Mrs Thatcher's longest-serving ministers - resigned over differences with the party leader over Europe.In his now infamous speech on the floor of the House of Commons, he attacked the PM's policies and leadership style, comparing being one of her cabinet ministers to opening the batting at cricket only to find his bat had been ""broken... by the team captain"".It sparked the beginning of the end of the 11-year Thatcher reign.Michael (now Lord) Heseltine seized on the opportunity to challenge the prime minister in the ensuing leadership contest, from which she would eventually withdraw and John Major emerge as her successor. Reflecting on the revolt and its implications on the Conservative Party, Baroness Thatcher's biographer Charles Moore wrote: ""Because the coup was unjustified, and so trust broke down, the politics of the next 15 years were those of civil war."""
2015-04-28,Election swings and roundabouts,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-32741924,"If election manifesto claims are all about smoke and mirrors, should we now add swings and roundabouts to the political metaphor?There's an intriguing aspect to the general election results in the Midlands that puzzled me.It's the striking contrast in the swings between Labour and the Conservatives.David Cameron and his campaign strategists knew they were home and dry when Nuneaton was the first Midlands marginal to declare.It was not only a Tory hold but a swing to the Conservatives from Labour of 3%.I was in the Nottingham suburb of Beeston awaiting the result of the Broxtowe count. Would its high profile Conservative MP Anna Soubry survive a red surge?Nuneaton set the pattern. Across the Midlands, both east and west, there was a uniform swing of between three and four per cent to the Tories - Warwickshire North 3%, Amber Valley 4%, Derbyshire South 4% and Sherwood 4%. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan topped the Tory swingometer in the Midlands marginals with 5% in Loughborough.Yet in the big cities, it was a very different story. The swing went to Labour.So in Nottingham East they enjoyed a 6% swing, Nottingham South 5.8%, Leicester South 7.3%, Leicester West 5%, Birmingham Hall Green 12%, Birmingham Hodge Hill 8%.If swings to Labour on this scale had gone beyond the city ring road roundabouts and into the suburbs, Ed Miliband would have become prime minister by now.In confidence, one senior Labour insider in Nottingham told me its success in the city wards was down to organisation, experience and its teams of activists.""We won the ground war. If Nottingham's city boundaries were extended into Sherwood and Broxtowe, we would have won those constituencies as well,"" he told me.Labour leadership candidate, Leicester West's Liz Kendall has identified her party's problem beyond the ring road roundabout.It's about reaching out to Middle England.""We need to show people that we understand their aspirations and ambitions for the future,"" she told the Sunday Times.The problem for Labour was that Middle England was not interested in what the party offered…and still isn't. The Cameron brand worked its magic in those Midlands marginals... it'll take something or someone special to break up that ballot box relationship."
2015-04-28,Royal 'lobbying',https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32740154,"Prince Charles sent 27 letters to then Prime Minister Tony Blair and members of his government between September 2004 and March 2005, ""despite the Freedom of Information Act!"" as the prince joked in one.But did his suggestions and concerns have any bearing on the behaviour of Mr Blair's government?The request: Prince Charles expresses his worries over an EU directive on complementary medicines ""which is… effectively outlawing the use of certain herbal extracts"".  Mr Blair replied, offering moral support and practical help. He agreed that ""the implementation as it is currently planned is crazy"" and set out an action plan that included delaying implementation for all existing products to 2011. What happened: Herbal products were not required to be authorised until 2011, just as Mr Blair had promised. Prince Charles continues to sell his own brand of complementary products, Duchy Herbals, through Boots and Waitrose. The request: Writing to Mr Blair, the prince expresses a ""growing sense of anxiety"" that the Hill Farming Allowance, which supports farmers working on Britain's uplands, could be scrapped. In his reply, the prime minister said he understood that the Hill Farm Allowance would continue until 2007. What happened: The allowance lasted until the end of Labour's tenure in 2010, when it was abolished.The request: Just 18 months after the US-led invasion of Iraq, Prince Charles raised the issue of poor performance of Lynx helicopters in high temperatures, saying: ""I fear that this is just one more example of where our Armed Forces are being asked to do an extremely challenging job (particularly in Iraq) without the necessary resources.""Mr Blair replied: ""On the subject of the Lynx helicopter, the limitations of the existing platform, particularly in the extremely challenging environment within Iraq, are well recognised by the Ministry of Defence."" He added that replacement of the helicopters would be a priority. What happened: Mr Blair's comments go much further than what he was saying about the subject at the time. In the event, though, the fleet was not fully upgraded until 2011.The request: Prince Charles lamented that the government's TB prevention plans might not ""include a commitment to deal with the badger problem in the immediate future"" and pushed strongly for a cull, saying: ""All I can say is that I do urge you to look again at introducing a proper cull of badgers where it is necessary.""Mr Blair sympathised, saying he could ""personally see the case for culling badgers"". However, he was unwilling to commit to a cull.  What happened: Culling trials were conducted from 1998-2005. The final results, published in 2008, said that the badger cull could ""make no meaningful contribution"" to curbing bovine TB. It wasn't until 2013 that a full culling programme began in two pilot areas. These ended with the conclusion that the pilots had been neither humane nor effective at curbing the spread of TB.The request: Then Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell wrote to Prince Charles to say she had decided to give parts of the historic Smithfield meat market Grade II listed status, and was trying to persuade deputy prime minister John Prescott to ""call in"" the planning application to prevent demolition of other parts of the site. She had been swayed by evidence provided by Sir Neil Cossons, who was English Heritage chair at the time, after he had been asked by the prince to add his support. Prince Charles replied that he was ""extremely glad to read of your appreciation of the value of this group of buildings"". According to the Guardian, market workers desperate to see the redevelopment of the site invited the prince to meet them to discuss it, but his office said he was ""unlikely to accept as he did not want to interfere in the planning process"".What happened: Smithfield market is still the subject of planning battles a decade on. Successive planning applications have been refused by ministers. Last year then Communities Secretary Eric Pickles rejected plans for an office development on the site, stating that ""the extent of damage that the application would cause to the important heritage assets at Smithfield runs entirely counter to national and policy objectives intended to protect such assets from harm"".In March, the Museum of London announced a move from its current Barbican site to the Smithfield market building."
2015-04-28,Election fallout,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32703139,"""Some of those gimmicks - that tombstone, whatever idiot thought that up I do not know!""I was talking to the former Mayor of Crawley in Sussex, John Mortimer, in the town's Labour Supporters Club about the vexed question of what went wrong, and where Labour should go next. This seat is one of those southern seats Labour hoped to take, but failed.I hear a whole range of views in the club.""They didn't give nothing to depend on, they should be clear, and a little bit more down to Earth."" ""Good party, wrong leader, they don't look after business enough.""Councillor John Stanley tells me: ""I think in a way we did go too left, but now we can go a bit centre-left, or centre, depending who the new leader is.""The former mayor sums up the mood on the doorstep: ""Whatever we told them, they didn't believe us.""  Expect to hear all those views, and more, in the coming leadership contest. Step back from the angst of supporters, and it may not be that hard to see why Labour failed.  An economic recovery, hailed by independent organisations as the result of government policy, undid a party that had loudly proclaimed for five years that the coalition's policies would lead to economic disaster. Combine that with an uncharismatic and uninspirational leader, then you might argue no further debate is necessary.Fat chance of that. Defeat breeds resentment, and this one has opened up old divisions.  A chorus of Blairties, led by the man himself, has declared that Ed's problem was ignoring those with aspiration and ambition, failing to appeal to those running business. Incidentally, I've been ticked off by the perspicacious editor of the New Statesman, Jason Cowley, for using the ""unhelpful"" term ""Blairites"".I can't think of another description that fits Tony, Lord Mandelson, Lord Adonis and David Miliband quite so well. But call them what you will, the message was clear - Ed was too left wing, Labour should move back to the centre, or, if you like, to the right.Reading Mr Blair's pithy analysis, listening to Lord Mandelson's gripping and savage eloquence, describing a party sent out to shout: ""We love the poor and hate the rich,"" and so ignoring the middle, and you realise strong emotions are in play.But back to the future may not be sufficient. Of course elections are won on the centre ground. But grandees grinding axes, affronted by the failure of boys who used to make their tea, may be creating so much noise that they can't hear more insistent sounds.  For there are several elephants trumpeting loudly as they cram into the small space of the shadow cabinet room. Imagine these beasts are as gaily decorated as Berlin buddy bears. One is decked out in red, another in imperial purple bunting, and another, a mammoth, strong tusked and ice rimmed, painted yellow with tartan trimmings.Take the last first. The Scottish wipeout is Labour's biggest problem. Fail to solve it, and Labour can forget ever having a comfortable majority again. It is hard to argue Labour were wiped out in Scotland because the SNP outflanked them to the right with their appeal to the business community and the ambitious and aspirational. But it is true the SNP drew in to people from left, right and centre, just as the modernisers say Labour should. It was the politics of economic self-interest, but cast in a very different light. Tribally sneering at ""the reactionary ideology of nationalism"" as Mr Blair does, will not reach the central belt of Scotland, the middle ground of  Midlothian.What about that purple pachyderm?  In Crawley - in fact in seat after seat - there is a similar pattern.  Labour did, in fact, often increase the size of their vote. So did the Conservatives, usually by a bit more. But the real dynamic was the total collapse of the Lib Dems and the dramatic rise of UKIP. The increase in votes for Nigel Farage's party wasn't translated into parliamentary seats, but, although it is early days in terms of research, it probably hurt Labour a lot. If we believe - and I do - Matthew Goodwin and Rob Ford, authors of Revolt on the Right, these voters are often former Labour supporters - older, less educated, those left behind on the tides of  globalisation, stranded on the shores of post-industrialisation. They may have had too many disappointments to feel much ambition or aspiration. They are a challenge for Labour, and any new leader will spend a good deal of time thinking how to deal with the concerns of Europe and immigration.Whether to share their fears, or confront them will be a big decision.Which brings us to Red Nellie. Those members who still proudly call themselves socialist. This is not about Old Labour - they are more likely to be baristas or barristers than boilermakers. It is easy as an outsider, as a journalist, to treat politics as an intellectual game about how best to win power - but many people, particularly the foot soldiers, particularly after the death of  purely tribal loyalties, are in it because they passionately believe in winning  power to do something specific.Many of them are suspicious of the later incarnations of New Labour, not because it reached an accommodation with wealth and business, but because it seemed to worship at the same altar, to regard the party's core beliefs in redistribution and equality as childish fantasies from a past age.Perhaps to Mr Blair, they are the problem, people who may equate ""ambition"" with greed. They might point out that a man who claims to be worth ""only"" £20m may find it harder than most to squeeze through the eye of a needle to understand their point of view. Most successful Labour leaders will confront the left at some point, but the concerns of this group go to the existential question ""What is the party for?""This is not a polemic - not an argument about what should be done, but a reflection on the complex conundrums that will face any new Labour leader, the tearing apart of the old alliance that made up a Labour majority, and so the political need to satisfy groups with very different, indeed, contradictory demands. But looking for a Social Democratic universal theory of everything may be missing the point. What the party desperately wants is a leader who can pull the disparate threads together and articulate them as common purpose. Whether she or he exists is another matter.Much more on that in the coming months."
2015-04-28,'Take us with you',https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-32736153,"Thousands of people in the north of England have been using the hashtag ""take us with you Scotland"" to express their upset about the result of last week's general election, and Scottish nationalists are welcoming this English minority with open arms. Last Thursday's general election was a rough one for the Labour Party in its traditional stronghold in the north of England. But further to the north, the left-leaning Scottish National Party won nearly every seat it contested. That political contrast has made some left-wing voters in places like Manchester, Leeds and Sheffield look fondly on their neighbours. Since last Thursday's election in Britain the phrase ""take us with you Scotland"" has been used more than 24,000 times. ""Genuinely beginning to wonder if the North of England becoming a part of Scotland would be better for us, I really am,"" tweeted Aaron Miller from Yorkshire. Some cracked jokes under the tag after the North West Motorway Police account, which gives traffic updates, announced that they had ""picked up a pedestrian on the M62 who was trying to walk to Scotland.""After an initial spike of jokes over the weekend, the hashtag really took off when users start to mobilise in support of around a year-old petition on the campaigning site Change.org. The petition calls for the north of England to secede from the rest of the country and join up with Scotland, and more than 12,000 people have signed it.Its creator, a Sheffield resident who calls himself ""Stu Dent"", set it up to coincide with last year's Scottish independence referendum, and he also created a map imagining the boundary of a ""Scotland plus the north"" country.Stu Dent runs the Twitter account Hunters Bar, named after an area of southwest Sheffield which is very popular with - you guessed it - students. Despite the account having thousands of followers on Twitter, when the map was first posted last year, the image was shared only about 100 times - however, in the past week it's been retweeted by thousands. Stu Dent told BBC Trending that he was surprised at how popular his idea has become. ""In hindsight, perhaps I shouldn't have been,"" he said. ""There is a huge frustration in parts of the UK about the things that have happened since 2010.""""I think people need a place to go where they can say 'not in my name! This is not the England I want',"" he added. But in addition to disappointment from some quarters about the election result, there might be another reason why the petition is getting a boost now: the power of the Scottish Nationalists on Twitter. What started as a post-election joke in the North of England was quickly embraced by the so-called ""Cyber Nats"" - and a trend was born.The SNP's social media strategist Ross Colquhoun expressed the party's mood about the hashtag best, in a post which was shared more than 500 times. ""2014: #LetsStayTogether 2015: #TakeUsWithYouScotland What a difference a year makes"" he tweeted.Blog by Hannah HendersonNext story: The sport reporter and the obscene ranter who lost his jobFollow BBC Trending on Twitter @BBCtrending, and find us on Facebook."
2015-04-28,What Britain wants from Europe,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32695399,"David Cameron says he has a mandate to pursue EU reform following the Conservatives' general election victory. The PM, who will be hoping his majority government will give him extra leverage in Brussels, wants to renegotiate the terms of the UK's membership ahead of a referendum by the end of 2017. He has said he will campaign for Britain to remain in the EU if he gets the reforms he wants.Mr Cameron has said he does not want to reveal full details of his negotiating hand but he has given a broad indication, in a series of speeches and newspaper articles, of his priorities when he goes into talks with other EU leaders.These are: The prime minister has said Britain would resist any move towards a European Army and that he wants to free British police forces from EU interference. He has also ruled out Britain joining the euro.But he has placed less emphasis in recent years on demanding changes to EU social policy, such as the maximum 48-hour working week, agency workers, maternity leave and non-discrimination rules.The official UK government position is that a referendum will be held by the end of 2017 but Downing Street sources have said: ""If we can do it earlier we will.""There is speculation David Cameron is planning to hold the vote in 2016 to avoid a clash with French and German elections in 2017.The prime minister wants treaty change but even if the referendum was held in 2017 there may not be enough time to legally incorporate any reforms into a treaty and it would have to be done at a later stage.An early referendum would anger Eurosceptics who believe it would not allow enough time to make the case for exit or negotiate any meaningful concessions.""A rushed process would severely undermine the chances to secure a significant deal that both British business and voters could support and would waste the opportunity of a lifetime,"" Matthew Elliott, chief executive of Business for Britain told Breitbart London.The question is always crucial in any referendum and there is already a debate about what it should be. The Draft European Union (Referendum) Bill, published by the Conservatives in 2013, proposed this form of words: ""Do you think that the United Kingdom should remain a member of the European Union?""Some thought that leaned too far towards the status quo, encouraging a yes vote, and the Electoral Commission said it was not clear and direct enough. The watchdog proposed this form of words instead: ""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union?""The new Conservative government will attempt to repeal the Human Rights Act, which requires UK courts to treat the European Court of Human Rights as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. The European Court of Human Rights is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe (CoE), which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine.The freedom for people to move around Europe, enshrined in the EU treaties, works in parallel with the other three basic freedoms in the single market: freedom of goods, capital and services.It is likely to be a ""red line"" for other EU leaders, who do not want to see it eroded.Mr Cameron has steered clear of tackling it directly - for example by asking for an emergency ""brake"" on free movement, or a cap on numbers - focusing instead on reducing the incentive provided by welfare payments. In a speech last November, David Cameron set out measures to reduce the number of EU nationals moving to the UK.His main proposals were:Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission, has said he is ready to work with Mr Cameron to ""strike a fair deal for the United Kingdom in the EU"". The leaders of other EU nations have previously warned they are unlikely to support major changes to EU treaties to accommodate British demands. But Mr Cameron's general election victory may have given him extra leverage. ""The ball is very much in the court of the UK now,"" a senior EU official told The Guardian. ""It's up to the British to define what they want."" The key figure will be German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is very keen to keep Britain in the EU but has so far been unwilling to make major concessions to enable that to happen. There are fears that a ""pick and mix"" approach to EU treaties would undermine EU cohesion.Mr Cameron has said there is ""no doubt"" his planned reforms will require changes to the treaties governing the European Union. But this would require the unanimous support of all EU members, and may not be possible within the deadline he has set of a referendum before the end of 2017. Any attempt to change EU laws on free movement would meet fierce resistance from some EU nations, particularly Eastern European states. Mr Juncker has said free movement is non-negotiable.Mr Cameron may find it difficult to get unanimous support for his proposals for a four-year waiting period for migrant workers claiming UK benefits. East European EU members would be likely to oppose this, on the grounds that it would discriminate against their citizens.  Attempts to secure opt-outs for the City are unlikely to go down well with other European leaders.However, there are precedents for EU treaty changes to accommodate some countries' specific concerns - for example, the protocol attached to the Lisbon Treaty for Ireland.Mr Cameron has faced repeated calls to say whether he would campaign for Britain's exit from the EU in the referendum if he fails to get what he wants from the renegotiation process. All he has said is that he will ""rule nothing out"". Some Conservative MPs want Britain to leave the EU no matter what David Cameron manages to renegotiate. A larger group are likely to want more concessions than Mr Cameron has so far indicated he is prepared to demand.Senior backbencher David Davis, who was defeated by Mr Cameron for the Tory leadership in 2005, told the Daily Telegraph the majority of the 332 Conservative MPs want Mr Cameron to negotiate an ""opt-out"" power to stop individual EU laws from applying to Britain. The prime minister has said this would be ""impossible"" without Britain leaving the EU.Mr Davis claims as many as 60 Tory MPs would be prepared to rebel and vote for Britain's exit from the EU if the prime minister fails to deliver.Graham Brady, chairman of the Tory backbench 1922 committee, which represents backbenchers, has urged David Cameron to give all Conservative MPs, including ministers, a free vote in the EU referendum.In January, Mr Cameron warned that serving cabinet ministers would have to quit the government if they wanted to campaign to leave the EU if he had secured the reforms to it he wants.In the 1975 referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Economic Community, as the EU was then called, Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson decided to suspend collective responsibility because his cabinet was split on the issue. Ministers were allowed to vote with their consciences and campaign against each other. The majority of them, including Mr Wilson, joined the Yes camp, but left-wingers, such as Tony Benn, played a leading role in the No campaign. The Yes campaign won easily with 67% of the vote."

2015-04-29,Scots Labour leader Murphy to resign,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32760196,"Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy is to resign next month, he has announced.It comes despite Mr Murphy narrowly surviving a vote of no confidence at a meeting of the party's national executive in Glasgow. Mr Murphy said he would tender his resignation alongside a plan to reform the party.He lost his seat in last week's general election as the SNP won 56 of the 59 Scottish seats, leaving Labour with a single MP in Scotland.Mr Murphy said he wanted to have a successor as leader in place by the summer, and confirmed he would not be standing for a seat at the Scottish Parliament in next year's election. Instead, he said it was time to ""do something else"" and that he believed the party would continue to be divided if he remained as leader. His deputy, Kezia Dugdale MSP, will become acting leader until a permanent successor is found. Mr Murphy had faced calls to resign from several MSPs, trade unions and former MPs in the wake of his party's near wipeout at the general election.He insisted he had decided to stand down ahead of the national executive voting by 17-14 in favour of him staying in the job.Speaking at a media conference after the national executive meeting, he said: ""It is clear that a small minority who didn't accept my election as leader of the Scottish Labour Party just five months ago won't accept the vote of the executive today and that will continue to divide the party.""Today I received more support in the executive vote than I did from members of the executive when I stood for election five months ago.""He said it would be up to the executive whether to accept the reforms he would be proposing before he left the post. But he warned: ""A party in such urgent need of reform blocks those changes at its peril.""The former East Renfrewshire MP said Labour had been crushed between ""two nationalisms"" in Scotland and England.Mr Murphy said he left no legacy of bitterness for anyone in the Labour Party, and the only person he was angry at was the person who blamed Scottish Labour for the party's UK-wide general election defeat - a reference to Unite leader Len McCluskey.And he said that in many ways Scottish Labour was the ""least modernised part of the Labour movement"" and that he wanted his successor to be elected under a one member, one vote system.Mr Murphy added: ""The Labour Party's problem is not the link with trade unions, or even the relationship with Unite members - far from it. It is the destructive behaviour of one high profile trade unionist.""The leader of the Scottish Labour Party doesn't serve at the grace of Len McCluskey, and the next leader of the UK Labour Party should not be picked by Len McCluskey.""Mr McCluskey has been a vocal critic of Mr Murphy's leadership and opposed his appointment in December when Mr Murphy won the contest to replace Johann Lamont.Jim Murphy laughed and joked with Scottish Labour's sole MP as he made his way down the hotel corridor to announce his resignation.He certainly brought energy and dynamism to his election campaign - but all that achieved was Ian Murray in Edinburgh South.So as Mr Murphy bows out, who could replace him?The deputy leader Kezia Dugdale may want to step up or Neil Findlay could try again after challenging last time. Maybe the party's finance spokeswoman Jackie Baillie thinks her steady hand could steer the ship.Jenny Marra is also often talked about as future face of the party.Whoever steps into Jim Murphy's red shoes he or she will have to face a difficult 2016 Holyrood election, to put it mildly.There are also more fundamental questions about how the party can possibly move on as it faces a surging SNP.Mr Murphy was very much a creature of ""New Labour"" - but to today's generation that's old Labour.Party members may start looking for someone with no links to the past, neither a Brownite nor a Blairite. A 'cleanskin' - as the politicos put it - may well help re-connect with voters.That's a long way from now though - even some of the party's opponents may view this latest train wreck with a modicum of sympathy. Ms Lamont had resigned after claiming Scottish Labour was treated like a ""branch office"" by the London-based party leadership.Mr Murphy concluded his speech by saying: ""Scotland needs a strong Labour party; Scotland needs a united Labour party. We have been the greatest force for change in our nation's remarkable history. ""The Scottish Labour party will rise again. It will be under someone else's leadership and I am confident about my party's future.""Harriet Harman MP, acting leader of the UK Labour Party, said it would be for Scottish Labour to choose a new leader. She added: ""As a cabinet minister and leader of his party in Scotland, Jim has been a hugely important figure in the Labour Party. He leaves with the best wishes and thanks of our movement.""Labour peer Lord McConnell, a former Scottish first minister, said the party's problems were ""much deeper than one individual and one affiliate"".He said: ""We have a disconnect locally and nationally with wider Scottish society. ""We have a problem with our political positioning in the post devolution age where the party particularly at the UK level has never been comfortable with success in the Scottish parliament and has always tried to see things through a UK prism rather than a Scottish prism.""We need to find a new generation, a new leader, new generation, new ideas, a fresh approach.""In a tweet, Scottish first minister and SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said: ""I wish Jim Murphy all the very best for the future. Leadership is not easy and he deserves credit for standing up for what he believes in.""Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson also reacted on Twitter, saying: ""Jim Murphy announces a managed exit in order to help the party, which is to his credit. But leaves a tough gig for whoever comes next.""The meeting of Scottish Labour's executive was disrupted by protesters who entered the party's headquarters.Police were called and the protesters, who included persistent anti-austerity activists Sean Clerkin and Piers Doughty-Brown, left the building to protest further from the street outside.The protesters were calling for Mr Murphy to remain as leader to ""finish the job of destroying Scottish Labour"".A Police Scotland spokeswoman said officers had been called and found two protestors on the third floor of the building. She added: ""Both left on police arrival. Advice and assistance was given."""
2015-04-29,Labour contenders clash on spending,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32761561,"Prospective Labour leaders have clashed over Labour's record in government in their first public debate in the race to succeed Ed Miliband.Former cabinet ministers including Yvette Cooper and Andy Burnham defended Labour's fiscal record and spending on schools and hospitals.However, candidates from the 2010 intake of MPs argued that the party spent too much while in office.The debate followed Chuka Umunna's withdrawal from the leadership contest.The remaining candidates appeared at the annual conference of the Progress think tank in London.There was agreement that Labour needed to demonstrate economic credibility to regain power, with shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt telling the meeting that the party needed to be ""trusted with public finances and the family finances"".Mr Hunt, who was first elected to Parliament in 2010 when Labour lost power, argued the last Labour government ""spent too much"" and failed to ""leave enough economic headroom to deal with the economic crisis and the recession"".Shadow health minister Liz Kendall said: ""There's absolutely nothing progressive about spending more on debt interest payments than on educating our children.""But shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: ""The Tories have had a triumph of spin over the facts in saying what they said about the economic record of the last Labour government.""The former chief secretary to the Treasury said the deficit did ""grow too large"" in the government's later years but insisted: ""The last Labour government ran more surpluses in its first term than the Tories did in 18 years.""Yvette Cooper, another former chief secretary to the Treasury, said: ""We should never let anybody tell us that it was too many teachers, doctors or nurses that caused Lehman Brothers bank in New York to crash.""Shadow international development secretary Mary Creagh said: ""People have forgotten the economic credibility that the last Labour government had.""She said Labour had built schools and hospitals that were ""treasured in our communities"".Ms Cooper, Mr Burnham, Ms Kendall and Ms Creagh have declared their intention to run for leader, while Mr Hunt told the conference he would make an announcement next week.At the same event, shadow energy secretary Caroline Flint announced she would be running for deputy leader.The Don Valley MP told the Today programme ahead of the debate that Labour lost the election because ""fundamentally the public did not trust us on the economy"".Exeter MP Ben Bradshaw has already announced a bid to be deputy, saying Labour ""must and could win the next election"", but only if it ""broadens its appeal by adopting sensible, centre-left politics which celebrate wealth creation and entrepreneurship"".Former Labour campaign co-ordinator Tom Watson is reported to be crowd-funding a deputy leadership bid, while Walthamstow MP Stella Creasy has said she is ""open to the question"" of running.Barnsley East MP and shadow transport secretary Michael Dugher - a fierce critic of Ed Miliband's election campaign - is to run Mr Burnham's campaign, according to the website LabourList.It is reported that Mr Burnham also has the backing of Labour peer Lord Falconer, who was lord chancellor and justice secretary under Tony Blair and was close to the former PM.Shadow culture secretary Chris Bryant has signalled his backing for Ms Cooper, tweeting that the next leader must be ""someone who's been tried in the fiery furnace of public opinion"".Mr Hunt said on Friday he would be be attending the debate - along with the other four hopefuls - to ""set out my analysis on how we begin to understand what went so wrong and why"".He added: ""We must use this leadership election to ask some very profound questions.""All voices in the party must be heard so that we can have a full and proper assessment as to why the politics of nationalism triumphed in Scotland and huge swathes of England, and how we have allowed the Conservative Party to present a more compelling vision for Britain to so many millions of people.""Speculation still surrounds shadow business secretary Mr Umunna's decision to pull out on Friday, when he said he was not ""comfortable"" with the ""pressure"" of being a candidate.As well as citing extensive pressure and scrutiny Mr Umunna also said he was ruling himself out because of concerns about the impact of the bid on his family.A rising star of the party, Mr Umunna was first elected to Parliament in 2010 - alongside Tristram Hunt and Liz Kendall - before joining the shadow cabinet.Asked about the candidate who might win, Conservative Chancellor George Osborne said: ""The Labour leadership contest has descended into farce.""But it's not actually about personalities. I don't think the Labour Party any more represents the working people of this country who aspire to a better life."""

I'm not suggesting he takes a break from being leader.""Clearly the national executive has the authority, they're the ruling body. ""I'm told that they made a decision. I'm told it was a procedurally correct decision, he is the leader but I think it's important that as leader he takes a break and I think it's important that we work out how these complex questions are answered by a team.""No one person has all the answers. I'm particularly concerned about tone, making sure we get a tone that ensures that the 27 million people who didn't vote for UKIP last week may be persuaded to vote for us in future.""The party has been beset by wrangling since Mr Farage agreed to stay on as leader, days after standing down after failing to get elected in Thanet South.He had pledged before the general election that he would quit the post if he failed to get elected to Parliament.Senior aide Matthew Richardson has left the party, following claims from MEP Patrick O'Flynn that Mr Farage had fallen under the influence of ""inexperienced"" advisers.UKIP has also confirmed the departure of Mr Farage's chief of staff Raheem Kassam.Mr Farage ruled out quitting as leader on BBC's Question Time on Thursday, saying he had ""phenomenal"" support, and has challenged his critics to decide whether they want to stay in the party.In his article, Mr Carswell had said that ""knowing how difficult it is to lead a party makes me admire Nigel Farage all the more"".""I know that I never could,"" he added, stressing that he would find it ""impossible to simultaneously lead UKIP, be the voice of the party in the Commons, represent my Clacton constituents and at the same time be a husband and a dad"".However, he said that ""even leaders need to take a break"", adding: ""Nigel needs to take a break now.""UKIP got nearly four million votes at the election, but returned only one MP - former Conservative Mr Carswell in the Clacton constituency."

Under the plans, ministers could force schools rated as ""requiring improvement"" and missing new government benchmarks to become an academy.Coasting schools have average results which have often flatlined over time.Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, Mrs Morgan said faster action was needed.She said: ""Our big priorities will be to speed up the process for tackling failing schools; extend our academies programme to tackle 'coasting' schools; and deliver on our commitment to open new free schools.""The proposals will be in a new bill due to be introduced in the Queen's Speech. ""First, we will take new powers to step in from the moment that a school is found to be failing,"" Mrs Morgan said.""From day one, regional schools commissioners will be able to bring in new leadership and support from other excellent schools and heads, and we will speed up the process of turning schools into academies to make sure that new expert leadership is found for all schools that need it as quickly as possible.""She said that coasting schools will be put on an immediate notice to improve and could then be taken over and turned into an academy.They will be required to work with a team of ""expert"" head teachers.She said: ""Those that aren't able to demonstrate a clear plan for improvement will be given new leadership - we know this works in turning schools around.""More than 3,300 schools in England are labelled ""requires improvement"", but the plans are unlikely to cover that many schools.Under the current system, secondary schools are considered to be failing, and therefore eligible for intervention, if fewer than 40% of their students score at least five Cs at GCSE, including English and maths, and they do not meet national averages in pupil progress.In primary schools, the threshold for intervention is if fewer than 65% of pupils get Level 4 in reading, writing and maths and a below average number of pupils make the expected amount of progress.It is not yet clear how coasting schools will be deemed in need of intervention.It is understood that a new category will be devised covering schools which are rated as ""requires improvement"" and which fail to meet a new set of standards on improvement."
2015-04-29,Co-op Group to keep political funding,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-32762858,"The Co-operative Group has decided to continue financially supporting the Co-operative Party, which has strong ties to Labour.Members of the group, the UK's biggest mutual organisation, voted on the issue at their annual general meeting.They passed a motion by 48,579 for, to 39,479 against, to approve ""political expenditures"" of up to £1m which support the movement's objectives.Last year the Co-op Group gave £625,000 to the Co-op Party.This figure was down on the sums donated in previous years. The AGM also included a vote on new corporate governance procedures which would mean members having less of a direct say.The Co-operative Group is still recovering from a period of financial mismanagement and some members have recently expressed concerns about how elections to the board are chosen.The banking arm of the group came close to collapse in 2013, bringing the whole group to a £2.5bn annual loss that year. The Co-op Party includes among its members a number of Labour MPs, including shadow chancellor Chris Leslie and Walthamstow MP Stella Creasy. The politicians stand as candidates of both the Co-operative Party and the Labour Party, and the two political movements have strong historical ties. The board asked the members of the Co-operative Group whether they wanted to continue financially supporting the Co-operative Party, or any other party. Allan Leighton, chairman of the Co-op Group, said: ""There's a clear remit from the members to continue to support the Labour Party.""It allows us to now have a conversation with the Co-op Labour Party about what we do next.""There was also a members' motion on the agenda, put forward by those in favour of making political donations of up to £1m a year.The motion to approve political funding ""not to exceed £1m per annum"" was carried by 55.17% to 44.83%.BBC business correspondent Joe Lynam said: ""To meet a £1.5bn hole in its accounts - mostly stemming from its banking division - the Co-op Group has had to sell off parts of its businesses and hand over majority control of its bank to American hedge funds.""It's also in the process of radically changing the way it runs itself into a more corporate structure with less of a direct say by its members.""He said that ""in theory"", each of the 2.8 million Co-op members could vote on a series of motions about the reforms, as well as how its bosses are paid, and retaining the links to the Co-operative party.One of the group's largest independent societies, Midcounties, recently threatened legal action over a shortlist of six candidates for the group's board being reduced to three - the number of positions available - before a member vote.

2015-04-29,Osborne plans July 'stability' Budget,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32761566,"Chancellor George Osborne has said that he will deliver a new Budget on 8 July.He claimed it would have ""a laser-like focus"" on raising productivity and living standards.He said he was making the unusual move of having a second Budget in one year in order to ""deliver on the commitments we have made to working people"".Labour said the chancellor would have to set out ""who is going to pay"" for what it called ""uncosted promises"" in the election campaign.Speaking outside 11 Downing Street, the chancellor gave a broad outline of his plans for the forthcoming Budget but refused to be drawn on the details, including the Conservatives' planned £12bn of welfare cuts.""I don't want to wait to deliver on the commitments we have made to working people,"" he said.""It will continue with the balanced plan we have to deal with our debts, invest in our health service and reform welfare to make work pay.""But there will also be a laser-like focus on making our economy more productive so we raise living standards across our country.""We're going to put Britain into good shape for the long term.""The last Budget was held on 18 March and included tax cuts for first-time house buyers.Writing in the Sun, Mr Osborne admitted it was ""unusual"" to have two Budgets in the same year, but he wanted to turn ""promises made in the election into a reality"".Again, Mr Osborne did not specifically outline how the Conservatives plan to fulfil a pledge to cut £12bn in welfare spending but said he wants to make the welfare system ""fair for the people who pay for it"".He writes: ""We will protect the NHS and give it more funding each and every year, while making savings across Whitehall. ""We'll crack down hard on tax avoidance and aggressive tax planning by the rich - because everyone should pay their fair share.  ""We will always protect the most vulnerable, but we also need a welfare system that's fair to the people who pay for it. If you can work you should be working, so we'll take the next steps in our benefit reforms to make sure that happens.""Second, we've got to go on helping businesses create jobs in Britain, so we move towards full employment. That means facing a hard truth: in Britain we produce about a quarter less for every hour we work than countries like America or Germany. Fixing that long-running productivity weakness is the big challenge for the next five years.""So in the Budget we'll spend less on welfare, and instead invest to create three million more apprenticeships, so that young people can learn a trade, get better jobs and earn more.""After the Budget in March independent forecaster the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said that Mr Osborne needed to spell out exactly how he plans to cut £12bn from welfare spending.Of those £12bn planned cuts, £2bn were outlined ahead of the general election - all the cuts are supposed to be in place by 2017-18.Labour's shadow energy and climate change secretary, Caroline Flint, accused the Tories of making ""a number of uncosted promises"" during the election campaign.She told the BBC: ""It will be interesting to see who is going to pay for those uncosted policies when they bring the Budget in July."""
2015-04-29,Farage should take a break - Carswell,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32761766,"UKIP leader Nigel Farage ""needs to take a break now"", the party's only MP Douglas Carswell has said.Writing in the Times, Mr Carswell said he admired Mr Farage, but questioned his ""ill-advised"" comments about HIV patients, made in a TV leaders' debate.Mr Farage ruled out quitting as leader on BBC's Question Time on Thursday, saying he had ""phenomenal"" support.It follows a bitter internal row within the party, which has seen two of Mr Farage's senior aides resigning.In his article, Mr Carswell said that ""knowing how difficult it is to lead a party makes me admire Nigel Farage all the more"".""I know that I never could,"" he added, stressing that he would find it ""impossible to simultaneously lead UKIP, be the voice of the party in the Commons, represent my Clacton constituents and at the same time be a husband and a dad"".However, he said that ""even leaders need to take a break"", adding: ""Nigel needs to take a break now.""He described Mr Farage as ""inspirational"", saying the party had ""done extraordinarily well"" under his leadership but now needed to ""consider carefully what comes next"".Earlier, Mr Farage challenged his critics to decide whether they wanted him to stay in the party.He said he had ""massive"" support from UKIP MEPs, donors and party members to continue in the role, suggesting one person, whom he did not name, was ""agitating for change"".Addressing the prospect of a future EU referendum, Mr Carswell said: ""All of us UKIP supporters should ask one question; Is what I'm doing at this moment making an 'out' vote more likely? If it isn't, stop it and do something else.""He also criticised Mr Farage's comments about HIV patients during the TV leaders' debate last month.While debating about the NHS, Mr Farage said: ""You can come into Britain from anywhere in the world and get diagnosed with HIV and get the retro-viral drugs that cost up to £25,000 per year per patient.""Mr Carswell wrote: ""By all means we should highlight the problem of health tourism. But we need to admit that using the example of HIV patients to make the point was ill-advised.""He said the party needed to strike ""the right tone"" and added: ""UKIP has been at its most persuasive when we have been most optimistic.""Anger is never a great way to motivate people - at least not for very long.""The party has been beset by wrangling since Mr Farage agreed to stay on as leader, days after standing down after failing to get elected in Thanet South.He had pledged before the general election that he would quit the post if he failed to get elected to Parliament.Matthew Richardson has left the party, following claims from MEP Patrick O'Flynn that Mr Farage had fallen under the influence of ""inexperienced"" advisers. UKIP has also confirmed the departure of Mr Farage's chief of staff Raheem Kassam.UKIP got nearly four million votes at the election, but returned only one MP - former Conservative Mr Carswell in the Clacton constituency."

They absolutely loved how he helped them and he was a highly-regarded local MP,"" Mr Bone said.""He stood up for what was right rather than what the party line was. In those days - the John Major years - it was much more difficult to stand up against the party machine. He had strong views on Europe.""Sir Peter started his career as an insurance broker, joining the Wycombe Young Conservatives in 1949 and the Oxford University Conservative Association in 1951.He went on to become a Conservative councillor on Buckinghamshire County Council between 1961 and 1967.Wellingborough mayor-elect Barry Graves also paid tribute to Sir Peter, remembering him as a ""very strong constituency MP"".""I remember going out and canvassing with him and he would go everywhere. He knew the area and the people. He was very much a man of the local constituency.""He was ""a very approachable man"", Mr Graves added.Sir Peter was knighted in 1994. "

2015-04-29,PM will 'look at' powers proposals,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32746049,"David Cameron has said he would ""look at"" any proposals for further powers for Scotland but wants to get the Smith Commission plans implemented first.The prime minister was speaking after meeting Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon in Edinburgh.Mr Cameron said he made a ""commitment"" to include a devolution bill in the Queen's Speech later this month.Ms Sturgeon argued the Smith Commission proposals were ""a good starting point"" but did not go far enough.The prime minister has pledged to include a bill on devolution in this month's Queen's Speech which would be based on the cross-party Smith Commission agreement. The Smith proposals included giving Holyrood the power to set income tax rates and bands, as well as control over a share of VAT and some welfare benefits. But Ms Sturgeon's SNP also wants the Scottish Parliament to be given powers over business taxes, employment law, the minimum wage and additional powers over welfare.Speaking after meeting Ms Sturgeon, Mr Cameron told the BBC: ""Let's make sure Smith is implemented in full. I'm going to keep the commitment I made to the people of Scotland. Let's get that done first because it does create a really strong Scottish Parliament.""He added: ""Of course, if people want to make future proposals I'll look at them.""The prime minister again said he did not support full fiscal autonomy for Scotland - the responsibility for all areas of tax and spending except defence and foreign affairs - stating that it would mean £7bn of cuts or extra tax-raising.What Nicola Sturgeon is trying to say is she has a mandate. She has 56 out of the 59 MPs elected in Scotland and she won 50% of the vote - unprecedented here in Scotland.She says that gives her leverage to push David Cameron. David Cameron says he wants to keep the nation together.The language coming out of Westminster last week was very much a cordial one. 'We will listen'.Nicola Sturgeon has warned him that if he doesn't listen, then the people of Scotland will judge him accordingly.Ms  Sturgeon described the hour-long talks at her official residence at Bute House as ""constructive and business-like"". She said Mr Cameron had made a ""commitment"" that the Smith proposals would be implemented ""as agreed"".""But secondly the prime minister agreed that he would look at proposals that we would now send to suggest the areas we can go beyond Smith,"" Ms Sturgeon said.""There was no agreement in terms of the substance of that but we will submit those proposals, the prime minister has said they will consider them and there will be a meeting to look at how we take that further forward.""Referring to her party's success in last week's general election, which saw the SNP win 56 out of 59 Scottish seats, Ms Sturgeon said: ""People in Scotland have now voted fairly convincingly for the SNP and sent a message that we want the Smith Commission proposals to go further and be built on.""The ball is in his court but I'm going into this in good faith.""She added: ""David Cameron and I are a world apart politically but, where we can, I'm determined to do business in the interests of the people of Scotland and across the UK.""She said she would have a ""constructive and business-like"" relationship with the prime minister. The two leaders shook hands on the front steps of Bute House as Mr Cameron arrived. Mr Cameron left the building shortly before 11:00, almost an hour after he had arrived.The two sides agreed to hold more regular discussions in the future, possibly quarterly. "

I'm human, the rest of my life is more important to me than politics.""The shadow business secretary has been distressed by the degree of scrutiny he, his family and his girlfriend have come under since he declared his intention to stand for the labour leadership.I am told that this includes reporters waiting outside the houses of relatives late at night.Friends of Mr Umunna deny that he is nervous of not getting the support of enough MPs to run for the leadership; they point out that he already has half the necessary names and that there are some weeks to go.The shadow business secretary now wants to play a leading role in arguing that Britain should stay in the EU and does not rule out seeking the leadership in the future.He said he thought he had understood ""the scrutiny and attention a leadership contest would bring"", but added: ""However, since the night of our defeat last week I have been subject to the added level of pressure that comes with being a leadership candidate.""The shadow business secretary said he had wondered if it was too soon for him to stand for the leadership, and ""I fear it was."" He also cited concerns about the impact on ""the rest of one's life"" and those close to him.""Consequently, after further reflection, I am withdrawing my candidacy,"" he said.Mr Umunna said he would continue to serve as shadow business secretary and hoped to ""play a leading role"" in Labour's campaign to keep the UK in the EU during the forthcoming in/out referendum.Commenting on the news, Labour former culture secretary Ben Bradshaw - who is expected to run for deputy leader - said Mr Umunna was a ""terrible loss"" to the field.He told the BBC's Daily Politics the Streatham MP had been the candidate the Conservative Party ""feared the most"".""And if it's the result of pressure on an extended family or an extended group of friends, I think that's a very sad reflection on our political culture,"" he said.Chuka Umunna feels ""liberated"", he told me, by his decision to quit the Labour leadership race.He hopes to be given a good role (shadow chancellor, I wonder?) by whoever becomes Labour leader. And I expect he'll become very high profile in the campaign to keep Britain in Europe, which is increasingly looking like it will be next May.He'll endorse a candidate in the next four weeks before nominations close. It will be very interesting to see who he piles in behind.Read more from Allegra (see post 13.23).Former Labour leader Lord Kinnock said he thought Mr Umunna had made the right decision.He said: ""If he felt in his soul that he wasn't prepared to subject himself - and more importantly his family - to the kind of attention which is fairly typical, sadly, these days, he has done absolutely the right thing.""There is no point at all in inflicting avoidable, unnecessary misery on those you love most.""Leadership contender Mary Creagh said she had ""huge respect"" for Mr Umunna, telling BBC Radio 4's World at One programme it took ""courage"" to withdraw from the leadership race.Mr Umunna was ""a big beast"" and would play a ""big role"" in the future of the Labour Party, she added.Yvette Cooper, Andy Burnham, Liz Kendall and Mary Creagh have already thrown their hats into the ring for Labour's top job while a number of other potential candidates, including Dan Jarvis, Alan Johnson and David Lammy, have ruled themselves out. Candidates must secure nominations from 34 colleagues - 15% of the party's MPs - by 15 June to make it on to ballot papers, which will be sent to members in August ahead of the leader's election a month later."

However, Mr Justice Stuart Smith at Southwark Crown Court said there was a ""very strong likelihood"" a custodial sentence would follow.The jury heard how Mote submitted numerous false expenses claims for payment for work that organisations had allegedly carried out on his behalf.Mote claimed the money was to pay whistleblowers in cash through third parties. He also said he had been ""targeted for being an anti-EU MEP.""During his time an MEP he also made £250,000 legitimate expenses claims.No date has been set for the sentencing."

2015-04-29,Round-up: BBC experts' analysis,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/election-2015-32650417,"The political future of the United Kingdom has become clearer after the results of the general election emerged around the country.David Cameron says he hopes to govern for all of the UK after the Conservatives took 331 seats - enough to form a slender majority in the Commons.Labour has been all but wiped out by the SNP in Scotland and suffered a disappointing set of results elsewhere, while the Lib Dems are left with just eight MPs after many party heavyweights such as Vince Cable and Danny Alexander lost their seats.So with battles won and lost and the fall-out and celebrations beginning, BBC correspondents examine the implications and challenges that lie ahead for the new government - and for those whose political careers have been ended by voters.No pollster, no pundit, no political leader saw it coming - not even David Cameron himself.Governing parties don't gain seats. Parties that have implemented painful cuts and are promising more certainly don't. Until that is the Conservative Party did - achieving what had seemed to be Mission Impossible - a Tory majority.Until that is David Cameron's personal triumph which triggered the near simultaneous resignation of his three principle opponents - Messrs Miliband, Clegg and Farage.They did so in part because they helped to crush their partners in coalition these last five years - reducing the Liberal Democrat parliamentary party to a size when it can fit into two London taxis and still have two seats to spare.In part because the extraordinary tidal wave of support for the SNP swept dozens of once safe Labour seats away.In part because Nigel Farage persuaded millions to vote for him but secured just one seat - not, though, the one he was standing in.Read more from Nick Robinson hereThe question uppermost in the prime minister's mind as he assembles his new government is how to keep the kingdom united.""Above all I want to bring our country together,"" he revealed after the result, ""to reclaim a mantle we should never have lost - the mantle of one nation, one United Kingdom"".Looking at the political landscape from Land's End today is very different to the view from John O'Groats.A sea of Conservative and Unionist blue dominates the scene across much of England, while a field of SNP nationalist yellow stretches to the horizon and beyond from the north.David Cameron's greatest challenge is to prevent the union he supports being torn apart by mutual resentment - resentment from Scotland at a Westminster government dominated by English Tories, and resentment from England at the preferential treatment people think is being given to the Scots.Those who assumed the future of the Union had been safeguarded by the Scottish referendum must think again.Read more from Mark Easton hereOne thing is rock-solid true: the Conservatives who worked on this campaign are as surprised by the result as the pollsters, pundits, politicians and general population.Maybe they shouldn't be - the economy is in good shape and the Conservatives had incumbency advantage.But when I travelled back from the prime minister's last rally with a group of exhausted Conservative campaign officials it was clear that 290 seats was a hoped-for target.No-one talked about anything over 300 seats, and no-one even mentioned an overall majority.So what special sauce pushed David Cameron into No 10 with a Commons majority?Mr Cameron had two simple messages in the campaign and he rarely veered away from them; the first - the economy is in good shape and the recovery is threatened by Labour. And the second - the SNP would hold a Labour-led government to ransom.Read more from Jonny Dymond hereBrian Taylor, BBC political editor, ScotlandOf all the comments on the overnight apocalypse, undoubtedly the most straightforward came from a defeated Scottish Labour MP.Since there were quite a few of them, let me narrow the focus a little. Come on down, Tom Harris.Mr Harris had plainly anticipated defeat. Nonetheless, he looked suitably lugubrious as his fate was confirmed.Why, he was asked eagerly, had Labour lost? ""Because we did not win enough votes.""Psephologically, it is perfect. Complete in itself. Psychologically, it sums up Labour's gloom without descending into subsidiary matters such as leadership, strategy and the rest. As a forward-thinking strategy, it is ideal. Win more votes. Simple.Read more from Brian Taylor hereThis has been an election which may have more profound consequences than almost any in living memory.We now face a generational decision about our future in Europe, with an EU referendum in two years' time almost certain.There will also be serious questions about the future of the Union, following an SNP landslide that has turned Scotland into a virtual one-party state.David Cameron's victory also represents a colossal achievement.Only once before in recent history has an incumbent government increased its majority - and that was Mrs Thatcher in her prime in the 1980s.It is also a significant personal victory for Mr Cameron and a rebuff for those in his party who had become increasingly sceptical about his ability to win.But while it may represent a defeat for those Tories who saw this election as a potential opportunity to rid themselves of David Cameron, he must now govern with a wafer-thin majority.For the SNP, their stunning victory can only increase the pressure on Nicola Sturgeon to include a commitment to a second independence referendum in her party's manifesto for next year's Scottish elections.It is an election which has not just defied all the predictions of the pollsters and pundits - but which may yet prompt the most fundamental re-casting of British politics for a generation.Read more from Norman Smith hereAfter an extraordinary night, some brief conclusions:Read more from James Landale hereIs this the end of the union?That is the question many people will be asking this morning after the party which has fought for Scottish independence for 80 years swept to victory.The answer from the jubilant Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon is a firm ""No"".She insists that her MPs will speak for all of Scotland, not just for the 45% who voted for the country to leave the United Kingdom last September.In the closing hours of the most extraordinary election campaign which anyone in Scotland can remember, Ms Sturgeon turned to talk of ""legitimacy.""That will be her watchword in the coming days as she argues that the prime minister cannot ignore the democratic will of the Scottish people.Politically, Scotland and England this morning look and feel like very different countries.Read more from James Cook hereAfter weeks of chatter about an election too close to call, it wasn't that close at all.David Cameron will be continuing as our prime minister.So, what is all this likely to mean?A referendum on whether the UK stays in, or leaves, the European Union, within the next two-and-a-half years.A race to be the next leader of the Labour Party.A race to be the next leader of the Liberal Democrats.And a huge new presence of Scottish National Party MPs at Westminster.And so here's another thing we know for certain this morning: Politics ain't going to be boring any time soon.Read more from Chris Mason hereFor Labour the story of their terrible night is rapidly turning into the search for a new leader. So who will that be?Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, is almost certain to run.  Even before this election, both he and another almost inevitable candidate, Chuka Umunna, had raised eyebrows inside the party at the work they had put in, preparing the ground with members and the unions for potential bids.Yvette Cooper, before the election, was still thought not to have made up her mind over whether to run. That decision has been made perhaps a little easier as her husband, Ed Balls, has lost his seat.She is certainly potentially in the frame, along with two lesser known names - Liz Kendall and Dan Jarvis - two MPs who were only elected in 2010 for the first time. This could be their moment. But whoever is in the job, they face a monumental task.Read Laura Kuenssberg's Twitter hereSterling is up (the most for seven years against the euro), share prices are up (especially bank shares like Lloyds and RBS, and energy shares such as Centrica), government bond prices are up.To state the obvious, investors love the Tories' general election victory.There are a few reasons.One (no surprise here) is that Labour's threat of breaking up banks and imposing energy price caps has been lifted.Second is that investors have been discounting days and weeks of wrangling after polling day over who would form the government - and so they are semi-euphoric that we already know who's in charge.Third, many investors tend to be economically conservative and instinctively Conservative.But although the City may be a bit drunk on the result, its pleasure in Ed Miliband's and Ed Balls' humiliation may be making it a bit blind - perhaps dangerously so - to some bumps in the economic road ahead.Read more from Robert Peston hereNigel Farage dreamed of holding the balance of power, but in the end his UKIP party is now worse off than when it came into the election.At the seventh time of asking he was rejected - this time by the people of Thanet South. It was a similar story in Rochester and Strood where Mark Reckless, who sensationally defected from the Tories last year, was also sent packing.In seats on UKIP's target list, like Thurrock in Essex, the party failed to make gains. In Grimsby - where Mr Farage went twice in the last six weeks - they came third.UKIP got around four million votes - with especially strong showings in north-east and south-east England - but it's ended up with just one MP, and a vacancy at the top. This has led to UKIP attacking the current system of choosing MPs, which it's described as ""busted"" and ""dysfunctional"".In one sense, this campaign was a complete failure and it's left an aftermath of angry voters, and others wondering if the UKIP bubble has burst.Read Robin Brant's Twitter hereI monitored 91 GB-wide voting intention polls during the 2015 election campaign and found nothing in them to prepare me for the final outcome.The good news for the pollsters was that their share for the Lib Dems was pretty close, as were the shares for UKIP, the Greens and the catch-all category of Others.The bad news for the polling industry was that the crucial shares for Conservative and Labour were the ones where they came most adrift.When all the qualifications of margins of error are allowed, there did appear to be a systematic overstatement of the Labour share and an equally systematic understatement of the Conservative one.It is for the pollsters to decide whether to conduct a review of their performance but I trust they will avoid the initial knee-jerk reaction of the immediate aftermath of the 1992 polls debacle.This general election performance follows the performance of the polls in the 2014 Scottish referendum where the choice was simply binary and yet all the polls were out by between 4-6%.Something is wrong. A lot of us would like to know what it is.Read more from David Cowling hereThe words ""political earthquake"" have been translated into numerous European languages, making front page news across the continent.While Britons now examine the domestic minutiae of the election result, here in mainland Europe the vote means one thing: a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU.

""We now face a generational decision about our future in Europe, with an EU referendum in two years time almost certain.

David Cameron's victory also represents a colossal achievement.""James Landale, deputy political editor: ""After an extraordinary night, some brief conclusions: With a small majority or slight minority for David Cameron, Tory MPs will be much empowered. As such, Mr Cameron will need support from other parties to get business through. The PM will also need a better whips office to handle rebellions.""Laura Kuenssberg, chief correspondent, Newsnight: ""For Labour the story of their terrible night is rapidly turning into the search for a new leader. So who will that be? Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, is almost certain to run.

2015-04-29,A history of political plots,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32749971,"Nigel Farage has apparently seen off a challenge to his leadership of UKIP - a move described by his former election strategist as a ""coup"". He's not the only party leader to face an attempted ousting. But can you recover from such a revolt?In 2006, the Labour prime minister was the target of what became known as the ""curry house conspiracy"" - a coup to remove him and install his chancellor, Gordon Brown, as prime minister.It would lead to several of the plotters' resignations - but not Mr Blair's. However, it was successful to a degree in that it forced the party leader into naming a departure date.The move against him was reportedly masterminded by Tom Watson, a defence minister at the time, who was also rumoured to have had a secret meeting with Mr Brown on the eve of the revolt.Apparently, Mr Watson and three fellow West Midlands MPs - Sion Simon, David Wright (both ministerial aides) and Khalid Mahmood - met over a biryani at a Wolverhampton curry house to discuss the PM's future, before dispatching a missive calling for him to quit.The letter - which attracted the support of a number of normally loyal Labour MPs - was leaked to the press, and ultimately resulted in Mr Watson's resignation.In his parting letter, the West Bromwich East MP took a shot at the prime minister, who he said should step down in the interests of party and country.Mr Blair denounced his actions and branded the former minister ""disloyal, discourteous and wrong"", saying he would have sacked him if he had not resigned.But Mr Watson's departure was swiftly followed by the resignations of six other junior members of government - who had also signed the rebel letter - in protest at the prime minister's refusal to say when he would step down as Labour leader.The whole affair resulted in Mr Blair announcing his intention to step aside within 12 months - which he duly did, on 27 June 2007.But it did nothing to quash internal dissent and speculation in the party over the future leadership of the party.Labour prime minister Gordon Brown found his leadership under threat in 2009 after one of his cabinet ministers dramatically quit the government and called for him to resign.Work and Pensions Secretary James Purnell - a former aide to Tony Blair - resigned from his post after the polls closed in the local and European elections, in which Labour was forecast to do badly.Explaining his decision to quit, Mr Purnell said the prime minister made a Conservative victory ""more, not less, likely"".It was Mr Brown's first direct challenge from a cabinet minister - but it would not topple the Labour leader as senior members of government refused to follow Mr Purnell's lead.Mr Brown was safe for the time being. But several months later, in January 2010, a fresh leadership challenge was mounted by two senior former Labour cabinet ministers.Geoff Hoon and Patricia Hewitt wrote to all Labour MPs, saying the party was ""deeply divided"" over Mr Brown's leadership and that the best way to resolve the issue was by way of secret ballot.They insisted it was not an ""attempted coup"" but a necessary step to resolve divisions within the party.But the duo could only muster the public support of a handful of backbenchers long-opposed to Mr Brown, with the majority of the party's MPs less than impressed by the move, which came just weeks before the general election.As the day wore on, a succession of cabinet ministers came out to back the PM, suggesting there was little momentum behind the plot - although it was noted that several were not exactly gushing in their support of Mr Brown.As history tells us, neither leadership challenge bore fruit but they reflected the internal doubts and divisions over Mr Brown at the helm.As leadership toppling attempts go, this one in 2014 was regarded as a particularly ""botched"" and ""shambolic coup"". Indeed, former Lib Dem leader Lord (Paddy) Ashdown described the move as a ""plot of deep malice"".Its instigator, Lord (Matthew) Oakeshott - a close ally of the-then Business Secretary Vince Cable - tried to unseat Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg.The peer was found to have commissioned secret polls suggesting the party would do better at the 2015 general election without Mr Clegg in the driving seat.The man Lord Oakeshott had long had in mind to take Mr Clegg's place - Mr Cable, who was on government business in China at the time - was forced to publicly condemn his friend's actions and state his backing for Mr Clegg.But Lord Oakeshott said the business secretary had in fact known about his polls and their findings.Nevertheless, the peer - who was denounced by the Lib Dem leadership for spending money that could have been spent on campaigning - quit the party, and issued a warning shot on his way out about the Lib Dems' future prospects.Mr Cable largely emerged unscathed but he faced questions about his loyalty to the leader. Although the two sought to put paid to reports of a rift with a (painfully awkward, 'nothing to see here, folks') stage-managed pint in a pub.Although the revolt failed, and Mr Clegg remained at the helm, the Lib Dems did go on to suffer a trouncing at the general election, losing nearly 50 of its MPs - one of them, Mr Cable himself - prompting his leader to quit.The Conservatives have a reputation for being more ruthless than their party rivals when it comes to getting rid of leaders they sense are no longer effectual.But, in 1995, Prime Minister John Major - tired of persistent rumours of a leadership challenge - decided to take the bull by the horns and trigger a surprise leadership election to silence his detractors.His own backbenchers had questioned Mr Major's ability to unite and lead the party, which was deeply divided over Europe.So ""put up or shut up"", he told them as he tendered his resignation as Conservative Party leader but not prime minister.But then stepped forward eurosceptic MP John Redwood, who resigned from the cabinet in order to contest Mr Major's leadership.This was unexpected by many, as the PM had said there had been assurances from his cabinet that none would stand against him.But Mr Major went on to win the ensuing election with a comfortable defeat over his challenger, who was not included in the PM's consequent cabinet reshuffle.No further contested leadership election took place until after the Conservatives' defeat at the 1997 general election, paving the way for William Hague to take over the running of the party.Not all attempts to oust a party leader end in failure: as Margaret Thatcher found out to her peril.With three electoral victories under her belt, the Conservative prime minister's downfall would come at the hands of her own party - not the voters.It was on 1 November 1990 when Geoffrey (now Lord) Howe - one of Mrs Thatcher's longest-serving ministers - resigned over differences with the party leader over Europe.In his now infamous speech on the floor of the House of Commons, he attacked the PM's policies and leadership style, comparing being one of her cabinet ministers to opening the batting at cricket only to find his bat had been ""broken... by the team captain"".It sparked the beginning of the end of the 11-year Thatcher reign.Michael (now Lord) Heseltine seized on the opportunity to challenge the prime minister in the ensuing leadership contest, from which she would eventually withdraw and John Major emerge as her successor. Reflecting on the revolt and its implications on the Conservative Party, Baroness Thatcher's biographer Charles Moore wrote: ""Because the coup was unjustified, and so trust broke down, the politics of the next 15 years were those of civil war."""
2015-04-29,Election swings and roundabouts,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-32741924,"If election manifesto claims are all about smoke and mirrors, should we now add swings and roundabouts to the political metaphor?There's an intriguing aspect to the general election results in the Midlands that puzzled me.It's the striking contrast in the swings between Labour and the Conservatives.David Cameron and his campaign strategists knew they were home and dry when Nuneaton was the first Midlands marginal to declare.It was not only a Tory hold but a swing to the Conservatives from Labour of 3%.I was in the Nottingham suburb of Beeston awaiting the result of the Broxtowe count. Would its high profile Conservative MP Anna Soubry survive a red surge?Nuneaton set the pattern. Across the Midlands, both east and west, there was a uniform swing of between three and four per cent to the Tories - Warwickshire North 3%, Amber Valley 4%, Derbyshire South 4% and Sherwood 4%. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan topped the Tory swingometer in the Midlands marginals with 5% in Loughborough.Yet in the big cities, it was a very different story. The swing went to Labour.So in Nottingham East they enjoyed a 6% swing, Nottingham South 5.8%, Leicester South 7.3%, Leicester West 5%, Birmingham Hall Green 12%, Birmingham Hodge Hill 8%.If swings to Labour on this scale had gone beyond the city ring road roundabouts and into the suburbs, Ed Miliband would have become prime minister by now.In confidence, one senior Labour insider in Nottingham told me its success in the city wards was down to organisation, experience and its teams of activists.""We won the ground war. If Nottingham's city boundaries were extended into Sherwood and Broxtowe, we would have won those constituencies as well,"" he told me.Labour leadership candidate, Leicester West's Liz Kendall has identified her party's problem beyond the ring road roundabout.It's about reaching out to Middle England.""We need to show people that we understand their aspirations and ambitions for the future,"" she told the Sunday Times.The problem for Labour was that Middle England was not interested in what the party offered…and still isn't. The Cameron brand worked its magic in those Midlands marginals... it'll take something or someone special to break up that ballot box relationship."
2015-04-29,Royal 'lobbying',https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32740154,"Prince Charles sent 27 letters to then Prime Minister Tony Blair and members of his government between September 2004 and March 2005, ""despite the Freedom of Information Act!"" as the prince joked in one.But did his suggestions and concerns have any bearing on the behaviour of Mr Blair's government?The request: Prince Charles expresses his worries over an EU directive on complementary medicines ""which is… effectively outlawing the use of certain herbal extracts"".  Mr Blair replied, offering moral support and practical help. He agreed that ""the implementation as it is currently planned is crazy"" and set out an action plan that included delaying implementation for all existing products to 2011. What happened: Herbal products were not required to be authorised until 2011, just as Mr Blair had promised. Prince Charles continues to sell his own brand of complementary products, Duchy Herbals, through Boots and Waitrose. The request: Writing to Mr Blair, the prince expresses a ""growing sense of anxiety"" that the Hill Farming Allowance, which supports farmers working on Britain's uplands, could be scrapped. In his reply, the prime minister said he understood that the Hill Farm Allowance would continue until 2007. What happened: The allowance lasted until the end of Labour's tenure in 2010, when it was abolished.The request: Just 18 months after the US-led invasion of Iraq, Prince Charles raised the issue of poor performance of Lynx helicopters in high temperatures, saying: ""I fear that this is just one more example of where our Armed Forces are being asked to do an extremely challenging job (particularly in Iraq) without the necessary resources.""Mr Blair replied: ""On the subject of the Lynx helicopter, the limitations of the existing platform, particularly in the extremely challenging environment within Iraq, are well recognised by the Ministry of Defence."" He added that replacement of the helicopters would be a priority. What happened: Mr Blair's comments go much further than what he was saying about the subject at the time. In the event, though, the fleet was not fully upgraded until 2011.The request: Prince Charles lamented that the government's TB prevention plans might not ""include a commitment to deal with the badger problem in the immediate future"" and pushed strongly for a cull, saying: ""All I can say is that I do urge you to look again at introducing a proper cull of badgers where it is necessary.""Mr Blair sympathised, saying he could ""personally see the case for culling badgers"". However, he was unwilling to commit to a cull.  What happened: Culling trials were conducted from 1998-2005. The final results, published in 2008, said that the badger cull could ""make no meaningful contribution"" to curbing bovine TB. It wasn't until 2013 that a full culling programme began in two pilot areas. These ended with the conclusion that the pilots had been neither humane nor effective at curbing the spread of TB.The request: Then Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell wrote to Prince Charles to say she had decided to give parts of the historic Smithfield meat market Grade II listed status, and was trying to persuade deputy prime minister John Prescott to ""call in"" the planning application to prevent demolition of other parts of the site. She had been swayed by evidence provided by Sir Neil Cossons, who was English Heritage chair at the time, after he had been asked by the prince to add his support. Prince Charles replied that he was ""extremely glad to read of your appreciation of the value of this group of buildings"". According to the Guardian, market workers desperate to see the redevelopment of the site invited the prince to meet them to discuss it, but his office said he was ""unlikely to accept as he did not want to interfere in the planning process"".What happened: Smithfield market is still the subject of planning battles a decade on. Successive planning applications have been refused by ministers. Last year then Communities Secretary Eric Pickles rejected plans for an office development on the site, stating that ""the extent of damage that the application would cause to the important heritage assets at Smithfield runs entirely counter to national and policy objectives intended to protect such assets from harm"".In March, the Museum of London announced a move from its current Barbican site to the Smithfield market building."
2015-04-29,Election fallout,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32703139,"""Some of those gimmicks - that tombstone, whatever idiot thought that up I do not know!""I was talking to the former Mayor of Crawley in Sussex, John Mortimer, in the town's Labour Supporters Club about the vexed question of what went wrong, and where Labour should go next. This seat is one of those southern seats Labour hoped to take, but failed.I hear a whole range of views in the club.""They didn't give nothing to depend on, they should be clear, and a little bit more down to Earth."" ""Good party, wrong leader, they don't look after business enough.""Councillor John Stanley tells me: ""I think in a way we did go too left, but now we can go a bit centre-left, or centre, depending who the new leader is.""The former mayor sums up the mood on the doorstep: ""Whatever we told them, they didn't believe us.""  Expect to hear all those views, and more, in the coming leadership contest. Step back from the angst of supporters, and it may not be that hard to see why Labour failed.  An economic recovery, hailed by independent organisations as the result of government policy, undid a party that had loudly proclaimed for five years that the coalition's policies would lead to economic disaster. Combine that with an uncharismatic and uninspirational leader, then you might argue no further debate is necessary.Fat chance of that. Defeat breeds resentment, and this one has opened up old divisions.  A chorus of Blairties, led by the man himself, has declared that Ed's problem was ignoring those with aspiration and ambition, failing to appeal to those running business. Incidentally, I've been ticked off by the perspicacious editor of the New Statesman, Jason Cowley, for using the ""unhelpful"" term ""Blairites"".I can't think of another description that fits Tony, Lord Mandelson, Lord Adonis and David Miliband quite so well. But call them what you will, the message was clear - Ed was too left wing, Labour should move back to the centre, or, if you like, to the right.Reading Mr Blair's pithy analysis, listening to Lord Mandelson's gripping and savage eloquence, describing a party sent out to shout: ""We love the poor and hate the rich,"" and so ignoring the middle, and you realise strong emotions are in play.But back to the future may not be sufficient. Of course elections are won on the centre ground. But grandees grinding axes, affronted by the failure of boys who used to make their tea, may be creating so much noise that they can't hear more insistent sounds.  For there are several elephants trumpeting loudly as they cram into the small space of the shadow cabinet room. Imagine these beasts are as gaily decorated as Berlin buddy bears. One is decked out in red, another in imperial purple bunting, and another, a mammoth, strong tusked and ice rimmed, painted yellow with tartan trimmings.Take the last first. The Scottish wipeout is Labour's biggest problem. Fail to solve it, and Labour can forget ever having a comfortable majority again. It is hard to argue Labour were wiped out in Scotland because the SNP outflanked them to the right with their appeal to the business community and the ambitious and aspirational. But it is true the SNP drew in to people from left, right and centre, just as the modernisers say Labour should. It was the politics of economic self-interest, but cast in a very different light. Tribally sneering at ""the reactionary ideology of nationalism"" as Mr Blair does, will not reach the central belt of Scotland, the middle ground of  Midlothian.What about that purple pachyderm?  In Crawley - in fact in seat after seat - there is a similar pattern.  Labour did, in fact, often increase the size of their vote. So did the Conservatives, usually by a bit more. But the real dynamic was the total collapse of the Lib Dems and the dramatic rise of UKIP. The increase in votes for Nigel Farage's party wasn't translated into parliamentary seats, but, although it is early days in terms of research, it probably hurt Labour a lot. If we believe - and I do - Matthew Goodwin and Rob Ford, authors of Revolt on the Right, these voters are often former Labour supporters - older, less educated, those left behind on the tides of  globalisation, stranded on the shores of post-industrialisation. They may have had too many disappointments to feel much ambition or aspiration. They are a challenge for Labour, and any new leader will spend a good deal of time thinking how to deal with the concerns of Europe and immigration.Whether to share their fears, or confront them will be a big decision.Which brings us to Red Nellie. Those members who still proudly call themselves socialist. This is not about Old Labour - they are more likely to be baristas or barristers than boilermakers. It is easy as an outsider, as a journalist, to treat politics as an intellectual game about how best to win power - but many people, particularly the foot soldiers, particularly after the death of  purely tribal loyalties, are in it because they passionately believe in winning  power to do something specific.Many of them are suspicious of the later incarnations of New Labour, not because it reached an accommodation with wealth and business, but because it seemed to worship at the same altar, to regard the party's core beliefs in redistribution and equality as childish fantasies from a past age.Perhaps to Mr Blair, they are the problem, people who may equate ""ambition"" with greed. They might point out that a man who claims to be worth ""only"" £20m may find it harder than most to squeeze through the eye of a needle to understand their point of view. Most successful Labour leaders will confront the left at some point, but the concerns of this group go to the existential question ""What is the party for?""This is not a polemic - not an argument about what should be done, but a reflection on the complex conundrums that will face any new Labour leader, the tearing apart of the old alliance that made up a Labour majority, and so the political need to satisfy groups with very different, indeed, contradictory demands. But looking for a Social Democratic universal theory of everything may be missing the point. What the party desperately wants is a leader who can pull the disparate threads together and articulate them as common purpose. Whether she or he exists is another matter.Much more on that in the coming months."
2015-04-29,'Take us with you',https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-32736153,"Thousands of people in the north of England have been using the hashtag ""take us with you Scotland"" to express their upset about the result of last week's general election, and Scottish nationalists are welcoming this English minority with open arms. Last Thursday's general election was a rough one for the Labour Party in its traditional stronghold in the north of England. But further to the north, the left-leaning Scottish National Party won nearly every seat it contested. That political contrast has made some left-wing voters in places like Manchester, Leeds and Sheffield look fondly on their neighbours. Since last Thursday's election in Britain the phrase ""take us with you Scotland"" has been used more than 24,000 times. ""Genuinely beginning to wonder if the North of England becoming a part of Scotland would be better for us, I really am,"" tweeted Aaron Miller from Yorkshire. Some cracked jokes under the tag after the North West Motorway Police account, which gives traffic updates, announced that they had ""picked up a pedestrian on the M62 who was trying to walk to Scotland.""After an initial spike of jokes over the weekend, the hashtag really took off when users start to mobilise in support of around a year-old petition on the campaigning site Change.org. The petition calls for the north of England to secede from the rest of the country and join up with Scotland, and more than 12,000 people have signed it.Its creator, a Sheffield resident who calls himself ""Stu Dent"", set it up to coincide with last year's Scottish independence referendum, and he also created a map imagining the boundary of a ""Scotland plus the north"" country.Stu Dent runs the Twitter account Hunters Bar, named after an area of southwest Sheffield which is very popular with - you guessed it - students. Despite the account having thousands of followers on Twitter, when the map was first posted last year, the image was shared only about 100 times - however, in the past week it's been retweeted by thousands. Stu Dent told BBC Trending that he was surprised at how popular his idea has become. ""In hindsight, perhaps I shouldn't have been,"" he said. ""There is a huge frustration in parts of the UK about the things that have happened since 2010.""""I think people need a place to go where they can say 'not in my name!

2015-04-29,What Britain wants from Europe,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32695399,"David Cameron says he has a mandate to pursue EU reform following the Conservatives' general election victory. The PM, who will be hoping his majority government will give him extra leverage in Brussels, wants to renegotiate the terms of the UK's membership ahead of a referendum by the end of 2017. He has said he will campaign for Britain to remain in the EU if he gets the reforms he wants.Mr Cameron has said he does not want to reveal full details of his negotiating hand but he has given a broad indication, in a series of speeches and newspaper articles, of his priorities when he goes into talks with other EU leaders.These are: The prime minister has said Britain would resist any move towards a European Army and that he wants to free British police forces from EU interference. He has also ruled out Britain joining the euro.But he has placed less emphasis in recent years on demanding changes to EU social policy, such as the maximum 48-hour working week, agency workers, maternity leave and non-discrimination rules.The official UK government position is that a referendum will be held by the end of 2017 but Downing Street sources have said: ""If we can do it earlier we will.""There is speculation David Cameron is planning to hold the vote in 2016 to avoid a clash with French and German elections in 2017.The prime minister wants treaty change but even if the referendum was held in 2017 there may not be enough time to legally incorporate any reforms into a treaty and it would have to be done at a later stage.An early referendum would anger Eurosceptics who believe it would not allow enough time to make the case for exit or negotiate any meaningful concessions.""A rushed process would severely undermine the chances to secure a significant deal that both British business and voters could support and would waste the opportunity of a lifetime,"" Matthew Elliott, chief executive of Business for Britain told Breitbart London.The question is always crucial in any referendum and there is already a debate about what it should be. The Draft European Union (Referendum) Bill, published by the Conservatives in 2013, proposed this form of words: ""Do you think that the United Kingdom should remain a member of the European Union?""Some thought that leaned too far towards the status quo, encouraging a yes vote, and the Electoral Commission said it was not clear and direct enough. The watchdog proposed this form of words instead: ""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union?""The new Conservative government will attempt to repeal the Human Rights Act, which requires UK courts to treat the European Court of Human Rights as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. The European Court of Human Rights is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe (CoE), which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine.The freedom for people to move around Europe, enshrined in the EU treaties, works in parallel with the other three basic freedoms in the single market: freedom of goods, capital and services.It is likely to be a ""red line"" for other EU leaders, who do not want to see it eroded.Mr Cameron has steered clear of tackling it directly - for example by asking for an emergency ""brake"" on free movement, or a cap on numbers - focusing instead on reducing the incentive provided by welfare payments. In a speech last November, David Cameron set out measures to reduce the number of EU nationals moving to the UK.His main proposals were:Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission, has said he is ready to work with Mr Cameron to ""strike a fair deal for the United Kingdom in the EU"". The leaders of other EU nations have previously warned they are unlikely to support major changes to EU treaties to accommodate British demands. But Mr Cameron's general election victory may have given him extra leverage. ""The ball is very much in the court of the UK now,"" a senior EU official told The Guardian. ""It's up to the British to define what they want."" The key figure will be German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is very keen to keep Britain in the EU but has so far been unwilling to make major concessions to enable that to happen. There are fears that a ""pick and mix"" approach to EU treaties would undermine EU cohesion.Mr Cameron has said there is ""no doubt"" his planned reforms will require changes to the treaties governing the European Union. But this would require the unanimous support of all EU members, and may not be possible within the deadline he has set of a referendum before the end of 2017. Any attempt to change EU laws on free movement would meet fierce resistance from some EU nations, particularly Eastern European states. Mr Juncker has said free movement is non-negotiable.Mr Cameron may find it difficult to get unanimous support for his proposals for a four-year waiting period for migrant workers claiming UK benefits. East European EU members would be likely to oppose this, on the grounds that it would discriminate against their citizens.  Attempts to secure opt-outs for the City are unlikely to go down well with other European leaders.However, there are precedents for EU treaty changes to accommodate some countries' specific concerns - for example, the protocol attached to the Lisbon Treaty for Ireland.Mr Cameron has faced repeated calls to say whether he would campaign for Britain's exit from the EU in the referendum if he fails to get what he wants from the renegotiation process. All he has said is that he will ""rule nothing out"". Some Conservative MPs want Britain to leave the EU no matter what David Cameron manages to renegotiate. A larger group are likely to want more concessions than Mr Cameron has so far indicated he is prepared to demand.Senior backbencher David Davis, who was defeated by Mr Cameron for the Tory leadership in 2005, told the Daily Telegraph the majority of the 332 Conservative MPs want Mr Cameron to negotiate an ""opt-out"" power to stop individual EU laws from applying to Britain. The prime minister has said this would be ""impossible"" without Britain leaving the EU.Mr Davis claims as many as 60 Tory MPs would be prepared to rebel and vote for Britain's exit from the EU if the prime minister fails to deliver.Graham Brady, chairman of the Tory backbench 1922 committee, which represents backbenchers, has urged David Cameron to give all Conservative MPs, including ministers, a free vote in the EU referendum.In January, Mr Cameron warned that serving cabinet ministers would have to quit the government if they wanted to campaign to leave the EU if he had secured the reforms to it he wants.In the 1975 referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Economic Community, as the EU was then called, Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson decided to suspend collective responsibility because his cabinet was split on the issue. Ministers were allowed to vote with their consciences and campaign against each other. The majority of them, including Mr Wilson, joined the Yes camp, but left-wingers, such as Tony Benn, played a leading role in the No campaign. The Yes campaign won easily with 67% of the vote."

2015-04-30,Scots Labour leader Murphy to resign,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32760196,"Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy is to resign next month, he has announced.It comes despite Mr Murphy narrowly surviving a vote of no confidence at a meeting of the party's national executive in Glasgow. Mr Murphy said he would tender his resignation alongside a plan to reform the party.He lost his seat in last week's general election as the SNP won 56 of the 59 Scottish seats, leaving Labour with a single MP in Scotland.Mr Murphy said he wanted to have a successor as leader in place by the summer, and confirmed he would not be standing for a seat at the Scottish Parliament in next year's election. Instead, he said it was time to ""do something else"" and that he believed the party would continue to be divided if he remained as leader. His deputy, Kezia Dugdale MSP, will become acting leader until a permanent successor is found. Mr Murphy had faced calls to resign from several MSPs, trade unions and former MPs in the wake of his party's near wipeout at the general election.He insisted he had decided to stand down ahead of the national executive voting by 17-14 in favour of him staying in the job.Speaking at a media conference after the national executive meeting, he said: ""It is clear that a small minority who didn't accept my election as leader of the Scottish Labour Party just five months ago won't accept the vote of the executive today and that will continue to divide the party.""Today I received more support in the executive vote than I did from members of the executive when I stood for election five months ago.""He said it would be up to the executive whether to accept the reforms he would be proposing before he left the post. But he warned: ""A party in such urgent need of reform blocks those changes at its peril.""The former East Renfrewshire MP said Labour had been crushed between ""two nationalisms"" in Scotland and England.Mr Murphy said he left no legacy of bitterness for anyone in the Labour Party, and the only person he was angry at was the person who blamed Scottish Labour for the party's UK-wide general election defeat - a reference to Unite leader Len McCluskey.And he said that in many ways Scottish Labour was the ""least modernised part of the Labour movement"" and that he wanted his successor to be elected under a one member, one vote system.Mr Murphy added: ""The Labour Party's problem is not the link with trade unions, or even the relationship with Unite members - far from it. It is the destructive behaviour of one high profile trade unionist.""The leader of the Scottish Labour Party doesn't serve at the grace of Len McCluskey, and the next leader of the UK Labour Party should not be picked by Len McCluskey.""Mr McCluskey has been a vocal critic of Mr Murphy's leadership and opposed his appointment in December when Mr Murphy won the contest to replace Johann Lamont.Jim Murphy laughed and joked with Scottish Labour's sole MP as he made his way down the hotel corridor to announce his resignation.He certainly brought energy and dynamism to his election campaign - but all that achieved was Ian Murray in Edinburgh South.So as Mr Murphy bows out, who could replace him?The deputy leader Kezia Dugdale may want to step up or Neil Findlay could try again after challenging last time. Maybe the party's finance spokeswoman Jackie Baillie thinks her steady hand could steer the ship.Jenny Marra is also often talked about as future face of the party.Whoever steps into Jim Murphy's red shoes he or she will have to face a difficult 2016 Holyrood election, to put it mildly.There are also more fundamental questions about how the party can possibly move on as it faces a surging SNP.Mr Murphy was very much a creature of ""New Labour"" - but to today's generation that's old Labour.Party members may start looking for someone with no links to the past, neither a Brownite nor a Blairite. A 'cleanskin' - as the politicos put it - may well help re-connect with voters.That's a long way from now though - even some of the party's opponents may view this latest train wreck with a modicum of sympathy. Ms Lamont had resigned after claiming Scottish Labour was treated like a ""branch office"" by the London-based party leadership.Mr Murphy concluded his speech by saying: ""Scotland needs a strong Labour party; Scotland needs a united Labour party. We have been the greatest force for change in our nation's remarkable history. ""The Scottish Labour party will rise again. It will be under someone else's leadership and I am confident about my party's future.""Harriet Harman MP, acting leader of the UK Labour Party, said it would be for Scottish Labour to choose a new leader. She added: ""As a cabinet minister and leader of his party in Scotland, Jim has been a hugely important figure in the Labour Party. He leaves with the best wishes and thanks of our movement.""Labour peer Lord McConnell, a former Scottish first minister, said the party's problems were ""much deeper than one individual and one affiliate"".He said: ""We have a disconnect locally and nationally with wider Scottish society. ""We have a problem with our political positioning in the post devolution age where the party particularly at the UK level has never been comfortable with success in the Scottish parliament and has always tried to see things through a UK prism rather than a Scottish prism.""We need to find a new generation, a new leader, new generation, new ideas, a fresh approach.""In a tweet, Scottish first minister and SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said: ""I wish Jim Murphy all the very best for the future. Leadership is not easy and he deserves credit for standing up for what he believes in.""Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson also reacted on Twitter, saying: ""Jim Murphy announces a managed exit in order to help the party, which is to his credit. But leaves a tough gig for whoever comes next.""The meeting of Scottish Labour's executive was disrupted by protesters who entered the party's headquarters.Police were called and the protesters, who included persistent anti-austerity activists Sean Clerkin and Piers Doughty-Brown, left the building to protest further from the street outside.The protesters were calling for Mr Murphy to remain as leader to ""finish the job of destroying Scottish Labour"".A Police Scotland spokeswoman said officers had been called and found two protestors on the third floor of the building. She added: ""Both left on police arrival. Advice and assistance was given."""
2015-04-30,Labour contenders clash on spending,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32761561,"Prospective Labour leaders have clashed over Labour's record in government in their first public debate in the race to succeed Ed Miliband.Former cabinet ministers including Yvette Cooper and Andy Burnham defended Labour's fiscal record and spending on schools and hospitals.However, candidates from the 2010 intake of MPs argued that the party spent too much while in office.The debate followed Chuka Umunna's withdrawal from the leadership contest.The remaining candidates appeared at the annual conference of the Progress think tank in London.There was agreement that Labour needed to demonstrate economic credibility to regain power, with shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt telling the meeting that the party needed to be ""trusted with public finances and the family finances"".Mr Hunt, who was first elected to Parliament in 2010 when Labour lost power, argued the last Labour government ""spent too much"" and failed to ""leave enough economic headroom to deal with the economic crisis and the recession"".Shadow health minister Liz Kendall said: ""There's absolutely nothing progressive about spending more on debt interest payments than on educating our children.""But shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: ""The Tories have had a triumph of spin over the facts in saying what they said about the economic record of the last Labour government.""The former chief secretary to the Treasury said the deficit did ""grow too large"" in the government's later years but insisted: ""The last Labour government ran more surpluses in its first term than the Tories did in 18 years.""Yvette Cooper, another former chief secretary to the Treasury, said: ""We should never let anybody tell us that it was too many teachers, doctors or nurses that caused Lehman Brothers bank in New York to crash.""Shadow international development secretary Mary Creagh said: ""People have forgotten the economic credibility that the last Labour government had.""She said Labour had built schools and hospitals that were ""treasured in our communities"".Ms Cooper, Mr Burnham, Ms Kendall and Ms Creagh have declared their intention to run for leader, while Mr Hunt told the conference he would make an announcement next week.At the same event, shadow energy secretary Caroline Flint announced she would be running for deputy leader.The Don Valley MP told the Today programme ahead of the debate that Labour lost the election because ""fundamentally the public did not trust us on the economy"".Exeter MP Ben Bradshaw has already announced a bid to be deputy, saying Labour ""must and could win the next election"", but only if it ""broadens its appeal by adopting sensible, centre-left politics which celebrate wealth creation and entrepreneurship"".Former Labour campaign co-ordinator Tom Watson is reported to be crowd-funding a deputy leadership bid, while Walthamstow MP Stella Creasy has said she is ""open to the question"" of running.Barnsley East MP and shadow transport secretary Michael Dugher - a fierce critic of Ed Miliband's election campaign - is to run Mr Burnham's campaign, according to the website LabourList.It is reported that Mr Burnham also has the backing of Labour peer Lord Falconer, who was lord chancellor and justice secretary under Tony Blair and was close to the former PM.Shadow culture secretary Chris Bryant has signalled his backing for Ms Cooper, tweeting that the next leader must be ""someone who's been tried in the fiery furnace of public opinion"".Mr Hunt said on Friday he would be be attending the debate - along with the other four hopefuls - to ""set out my analysis on how we begin to understand what went so wrong and why"".He added: ""We must use this leadership election to ask some very profound questions.""All voices in the party must be heard so that we can have a full and proper assessment as to why the politics of nationalism triumphed in Scotland and huge swathes of England, and how we have allowed the Conservative Party to present a more compelling vision for Britain to so many millions of people.""Speculation still surrounds shadow business secretary Mr Umunna's decision to pull out on Friday, when he said he was not ""comfortable"" with the ""pressure"" of being a candidate.As well as citing extensive pressure and scrutiny Mr Umunna also said he was ruling himself out because of concerns about the impact of the bid on his family.A rising star of the party, Mr Umunna was first elected to Parliament in 2010 - alongside Tristram Hunt and Liz Kendall - before joining the shadow cabinet.Asked about the candidate who might win, Conservative Chancellor George Osborne said: ""The Labour leadership contest has descended into farce.""But it's not actually about personalities. I don't think the Labour Party any more represents the working people of this country who aspire to a better life."""

I'm not suggesting he takes a break from being leader.""Clearly the national executive has the authority, they're the ruling body. ""I'm told that they made a decision. I'm told it was a procedurally correct decision, he is the leader but I think it's important that as leader he takes a break and I think it's important that we work out how these complex questions are answered by a team.""No one person has all the answers. I'm particularly concerned about tone, making sure we get a tone that ensures that the 27 million people who didn't vote for UKIP last week may be persuaded to vote for us in future.""The party has been beset by wrangling since Mr Farage agreed to stay on as leader, days after standing down after failing to get elected in Thanet South.He had pledged before the general election that he would quit the post if he failed to get elected to Parliament.Senior aide Matthew Richardson has left the party, following claims from MEP Patrick O'Flynn that Mr Farage had fallen under the influence of ""inexperienced"" advisers.UKIP has also confirmed the departure of Mr Farage's chief of staff Raheem Kassam.Mr Farage ruled out quitting as leader on BBC's Question Time on Thursday, saying he had ""phenomenal"" support, and has challenged his critics to decide whether they want to stay in the party.In his article, Mr Carswell had said that ""knowing how difficult it is to lead a party makes me admire Nigel Farage all the more"".""I know that I never could,"" he added, stressing that he would find it ""impossible to simultaneously lead UKIP, be the voice of the party in the Commons, represent my Clacton constituents and at the same time be a husband and a dad"".However, he said that ""even leaders need to take a break"", adding: ""Nigel needs to take a break now.""UKIP got nearly four million votes at the election, but returned only one MP - former Conservative Mr Carswell in the Clacton constituency."
2015-04-30,Coasting schools 'must improve',https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/education-32763097,"Education Secretary Nicky Morgan has said new powers to sack head teachers in coasting schools will show ""it is not OK to be just above the level of failing"". Under the plans, ministers could force schools rated as ""requiring improvement"" and missing new government benchmarks to become an academy.Coasting schools have average results which have often flatlined over time.Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, Mrs Morgan said faster action was needed.She said: ""Our big priorities will be to speed up the process for tackling failing schools; extend our academies programme to tackle 'coasting' schools; and deliver on our commitment to open new free schools.""The proposals will be in a new bill due to be introduced in the Queen's Speech. ""First, we will take new powers to step in from the moment that a school is found to be failing,"" Mrs Morgan said.""From day one, regional schools commissioners will be able to bring in new leadership and support from other excellent schools and heads, and we will speed up the process of turning schools into academies to make sure that new expert leadership is found for all schools that need it as quickly as possible.""She said that coasting schools will be put on an immediate notice to improve and could then be taken over and turned into an academy.They will be required to work with a team of ""expert"" head teachers.She said: ""Those that aren't able to demonstrate a clear plan for improvement will be given new leadership - we know this works in turning schools around.""More than 3,300 schools in England are labelled ""requires improvement"", but the plans are unlikely to cover that many schools.Under the current system, secondary schools are considered to be failing, and therefore eligible for intervention, if fewer than 40% of their students score at least five Cs at GCSE, including English and maths, and they do not meet national averages in pupil progress.In primary schools, the threshold for intervention is if fewer than 65% of pupils get Level 4 in reading, writing and maths and a below average number of pupils make the expected amount of progress.It is not yet clear how coasting schools will be deemed in need of intervention.It is understood that a new category will be devised covering schools which are rated as ""requires improvement"" and which fail to meet a new set of standards on improvement."
2015-04-30,Co-op Group to keep political funding,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-32762858,"The Co-operative Group has decided to continue financially supporting the Co-operative Party, which has strong ties to Labour.Members of the group, the UK's biggest mutual organisation, voted on the issue at their annual general meeting.They passed a motion by 48,579 for, to 39,479 against, to approve ""political expenditures"" of up to £1m which support the movement's objectives.Last year the Co-op Group gave £625,000 to the Co-op Party.This figure was down on the sums donated in previous years. The AGM also included a vote on new corporate governance procedures which would mean members having less of a direct say.The Co-operative Group is still recovering from a period of financial mismanagement and some members have recently expressed concerns about how elections to the board are chosen.The banking arm of the group came close to collapse in 2013, bringing the whole group to a £2.5bn annual loss that year. The Co-op Party includes among its members a number of Labour MPs, including shadow chancellor Chris Leslie and Walthamstow MP Stella Creasy. The politicians stand as candidates of both the Co-operative Party and the Labour Party, and the two political movements have strong historical ties. The board asked the members of the Co-operative Group whether they wanted to continue financially supporting the Co-operative Party, or any other party. Allan Leighton, chairman of the Co-op Group, said: ""There's a clear remit from the members to continue to support the Labour Party.""It allows us to now have a conversation with the Co-op Labour Party about what we do next.""There was also a members' motion on the agenda, put forward by those in favour of making political donations of up to £1m a year.The motion to approve political funding ""not to exceed £1m per annum"" was carried by 55.17% to 44.83%.BBC business correspondent Joe Lynam said: ""To meet a £1.5bn hole in its accounts - mostly stemming from its banking division - the Co-op Group has had to sell off parts of its businesses and hand over majority control of its bank to American hedge funds.""It's also in the process of radically changing the way it runs itself into a more corporate structure with less of a direct say by its members.""He said that ""in theory"", each of the 2.8 million Co-op members could vote on a series of motions about the reforms, as well as how its bosses are paid, and retaining the links to the Co-operative party.One of the group's largest independent societies, Midcounties, recently threatened legal action over a shortlist of six candidates for the group's board being reduced to three - the number of positions available - before a member vote.

2015-04-30,Osborne plans July 'stability' Budget,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32761566,"Chancellor George Osborne has said that he will deliver a new Budget on 8 July.He claimed it would have ""a laser-like focus"" on raising productivity and living standards.He said he was making the unusual move of having a second Budget in one year in order to ""deliver on the commitments we have made to working people"".Labour said the chancellor would have to set out ""who is going to pay"" for what it called ""uncosted promises"" in the election campaign.Speaking outside 11 Downing Street, the chancellor gave a broad outline of his plans for the forthcoming Budget but refused to be drawn on the details, including the Conservatives' planned £12bn of welfare cuts.""I don't want to wait to deliver on the commitments we have made to working people,"" he said.""It will continue with the balanced plan we have to deal with our debts, invest in our health service and reform welfare to make work pay.""But there will also be a laser-like focus on making our economy more productive so we raise living standards across our country.""We're going to put Britain into good shape for the long term.""The last Budget was held on 18 March and included tax cuts for first-time house buyers.Writing in the Sun, Mr Osborne admitted it was ""unusual"" to have two Budgets in the same year, but he wanted to turn ""promises made in the election into a reality"".Again, Mr Osborne did not specifically outline how the Conservatives plan to fulfil a pledge to cut £12bn in welfare spending but said he wants to make the welfare system ""fair for the people who pay for it"".He writes: ""We will protect the NHS and give it more funding each and every year, while making savings across Whitehall. ""We'll crack down hard on tax avoidance and aggressive tax planning by the rich - because everyone should pay their fair share.  ""We will always protect the most vulnerable, but we also need a welfare system that's fair to the people who pay for it. If you can work you should be working, so we'll take the next steps in our benefit reforms to make sure that happens.""Second, we've got to go on helping businesses create jobs in Britain, so we move towards full employment. That means facing a hard truth: in Britain we produce about a quarter less for every hour we work than countries like America or Germany. Fixing that long-running productivity weakness is the big challenge for the next five years.""So in the Budget we'll spend less on welfare, and instead invest to create three million more apprenticeships, so that young people can learn a trade, get better jobs and earn more.""After the Budget in March independent forecaster the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said that Mr Osborne needed to spell out exactly how he plans to cut £12bn from welfare spending.Of those £12bn planned cuts, £2bn were outlined ahead of the general election - all the cuts are supposed to be in place by 2017-18.Labour's shadow energy and climate change secretary, Caroline Flint, accused the Tories of making ""a number of uncosted promises"" during the election campaign.She told the BBC: ""It will be interesting to see who is going to pay for those uncosted policies when they bring the Budget in July."""
2015-04-30,Farage should take a break - Carswell,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32761766,"UKIP leader Nigel Farage ""needs to take a break now"", the party's only MP Douglas Carswell has said.Writing in the Times, Mr Carswell said he admired Mr Farage, but questioned his ""ill-advised"" comments about HIV patients, made in a TV leaders' debate.Mr Farage ruled out quitting as leader on BBC's Question Time on Thursday, saying he had ""phenomenal"" support.It follows a bitter internal row within the party, which has seen two of Mr Farage's senior aides resigning.In his article, Mr Carswell said that ""knowing how difficult it is to lead a party makes me admire Nigel Farage all the more"".""I know that I never could,"" he added, stressing that he would find it ""impossible to simultaneously lead UKIP, be the voice of the party in the Commons, represent my Clacton constituents and at the same time be a husband and a dad"".However, he said that ""even leaders need to take a break"", adding: ""Nigel needs to take a break now.""He described Mr Farage as ""inspirational"", saying the party had ""done extraordinarily well"" under his leadership but now needed to ""consider carefully what comes next"".Earlier, Mr Farage challenged his critics to decide whether they wanted him to stay in the party.He said he had ""massive"" support from UKIP MEPs, donors and party members to continue in the role, suggesting one person, whom he did not name, was ""agitating for change"".Addressing the prospect of a future EU referendum, Mr Carswell said: ""All of us UKIP supporters should ask one question; Is what I'm doing at this moment making an 'out' vote more likely? If it isn't, stop it and do something else.""He also criticised Mr Farage's comments about HIV patients during the TV leaders' debate last month.While debating about the NHS, Mr Farage said: ""You can come into Britain from anywhere in the world and get diagnosed with HIV and get the retro-viral drugs that cost up to £25,000 per year per patient.""Mr Carswell wrote: ""By all means we should highlight the problem of health tourism. But we need to admit that using the example of HIV patients to make the point was ill-advised.""He said the party needed to strike ""the right tone"" and added: ""UKIP has been at its most persuasive when we have been most optimistic.""Anger is never a great way to motivate people - at least not for very long.""The party has been beset by wrangling since Mr Farage agreed to stay on as leader, days after standing down after failing to get elected in Thanet South.He had pledged before the general election that he would quit the post if he failed to get elected to Parliament.Matthew Richardson has left the party, following claims from MEP Patrick O'Flynn that Mr Farage had fallen under the influence of ""inexperienced"" advisers. UKIP has also confirmed the departure of Mr Farage's chief of staff Raheem Kassam.UKIP got nearly four million votes at the election, but returned only one MP - former Conservative Mr Carswell in the Clacton constituency."
2015-04-30,Tributes as ex-Conservative MP dies,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-northamptonshire-32764540,"Tributes have been paid to former Conservative MP Sir Peter Fry who has died at the age of 83.Sir Peter, who had been ill for a year, was MP for Wellingborough and Rushden, in Northamptonshire, for 28 years from 1969 until his defeat by Labour in 1997.In government he was notable as an expert on transport issues.Current Wellingborough Conservative MP Peter Bone said Sir Peter remained ""extremely well thought of"".""When I was canvassing in the last election, people were still talking about him. They absolutely loved how he helped them and he was a highly-regarded local MP,"" Mr Bone said.""He stood up for what was right rather than what the party line was. In those days - the John Major years - it was much more difficult to stand up against the party machine. He had strong views on Europe.""Sir Peter started his career as an insurance broker, joining the Wycombe Young Conservatives in 1949 and the Oxford University Conservative Association in 1951.He went on to become a Conservative councillor on Buckinghamshire County Council between 1961 and 1967.Wellingborough mayor-elect Barry Graves also paid tribute to Sir Peter, remembering him as a ""very strong constituency MP"".""I remember going out and canvassing with him and he would go everywhere. He knew the area and the people. He was very much a man of the local constituency.""He was ""a very approachable man"", Mr Graves added.Sir Peter was knighted in 1994. "

2015-04-30,PM will 'look at' powers proposals,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32746049,"David Cameron has said he would ""look at"" any proposals for further powers for Scotland but wants to get the Smith Commission plans implemented first.The prime minister was speaking after meeting Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon in Edinburgh.Mr Cameron said he made a ""commitment"" to include a devolution bill in the Queen's Speech later this month.Ms Sturgeon argued the Smith Commission proposals were ""a good starting point"" but did not go far enough.The prime minister has pledged to include a bill on devolution in this month's Queen's Speech which would be based on the cross-party Smith Commission agreement. The Smith proposals included giving Holyrood the power to set income tax rates and bands, as well as control over a share of VAT and some welfare benefits. But Ms Sturgeon's SNP also wants the Scottish Parliament to be given powers over business taxes, employment law, the minimum wage and additional powers over welfare.Speaking after meeting Ms Sturgeon, Mr Cameron told the BBC: ""Let's make sure Smith is implemented in full. I'm going to keep the commitment I made to the people of Scotland. Let's get that done first because it does create a really strong Scottish Parliament.""He added: ""Of course, if people want to make future proposals I'll look at them.""The prime minister again said he did not support full fiscal autonomy for Scotland - the responsibility for all areas of tax and spending except defence and foreign affairs - stating that it would mean £7bn of cuts or extra tax-raising.What Nicola Sturgeon is trying to say is she has a mandate. She has 56 out of the 59 MPs elected in Scotland and she won 50% of the vote - unprecedented here in Scotland.She says that gives her leverage to push David Cameron. David Cameron says he wants to keep the nation together.The language coming out of Westminster last week was very much a cordial one. 'We will listen'.Nicola Sturgeon has warned him that if he doesn't listen, then the people of Scotland will judge him accordingly.Ms  Sturgeon described the hour-long talks at her official residence at Bute House as ""constructive and business-like"". She said Mr Cameron had made a ""commitment"" that the Smith proposals would be implemented ""as agreed"".""But secondly the prime minister agreed that he would look at proposals that we would now send to suggest the areas we can go beyond Smith,"" Ms Sturgeon said.""There was no agreement in terms of the substance of that but we will submit those proposals, the prime minister has said they will consider them and there will be a meeting to look at how we take that further forward.""Referring to her party's success in last week's general election, which saw the SNP win 56 out of 59 Scottish seats, Ms Sturgeon said: ""People in Scotland have now voted fairly convincingly for the SNP and sent a message that we want the Smith Commission proposals to go further and be built on.""The ball is in his court but I'm going into this in good faith.""She added: ""David Cameron and I are a world apart politically but, where we can, I'm determined to do business in the interests of the people of Scotland and across the UK.""She said she would have a ""constructive and business-like"" relationship with the prime minister. The two leaders shook hands on the front steps of Bute House as Mr Cameron arrived. Mr Cameron left the building shortly before 11:00, almost an hour after he had arrived.The two sides agreed to hold more regular discussions in the future, possibly quarterly. "
2015-04-30,Umunna withdraws Labour leader bid,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32748106,"Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna has withdrawn from the Labour party leadership contest, just days after throwing his hat into the ring.The MP, 36, said in a statement that he was not comfortable with the level of pressure and scrutiny that came with being a leadership candidate.Mr Umunna also cited concerns about the impact of the bid on his family.BBC political editor Nick Robinson said the MP's team insisted no ""unwelcome press story"" lay behind the move.But Mr Umunna had been shocked by the level of scrutiny of himself, his mother, sister and girlfriend, he said.You can follow the latest reaction here.A rising star of the party, Mr Umunna was first elected to Parliament in 2010 before joining the shadow cabinet.He confirmed his candidacy for the Labour leadership via a post on his Facebook page on 12 May, saying the party under Ed Miliband had failed to appeal to enough voters in England.But on Friday he said he had not found the leadership bid to be ""a comfortable experience"".I understand that Chuka Umunna has told friends that ""this is not right for me or people close to me. I'm human, the rest of my life is more important to me than politics.""The shadow business secretary has been distressed by the degree of scrutiny he, his family and his girlfriend have come under since he declared his intention to stand for the labour leadership.I am told that this includes reporters waiting outside the houses of relatives late at night.Friends of Mr Umunna deny that he is nervous of not getting the support of enough MPs to run for the leadership; they point out that he already has half the necessary names and that there are some weeks to go.The shadow business secretary now wants to play a leading role in arguing that Britain should stay in the EU and does not rule out seeking the leadership in the future.He said he thought he had understood ""the scrutiny and attention a leadership contest would bring"", but added: ""However, since the night of our defeat last week I have been subject to the added level of pressure that comes with being a leadership candidate.""The shadow business secretary said he had wondered if it was too soon for him to stand for the leadership, and ""I fear it was."" He also cited concerns about the impact on ""the rest of one's life"" and those close to him.""Consequently, after further reflection, I am withdrawing my candidacy,"" he said.Mr Umunna said he would continue to serve as shadow business secretary and hoped to ""play a leading role"" in Labour's campaign to keep the UK in the EU during the forthcoming in/out referendum.Commenting on the news, Labour former culture secretary Ben Bradshaw - who is expected to run for deputy leader - said Mr Umunna was a ""terrible loss"" to the field.He told the BBC's Daily Politics the Streatham MP had been the candidate the Conservative Party ""feared the most"".""And if it's the result of pressure on an extended family or an extended group of friends, I think that's a very sad reflection on our political culture,"" he said.Chuka Umunna feels ""liberated"", he told me, by his decision to quit the Labour leadership race.He hopes to be given a good role (shadow chancellor, I wonder?) by whoever becomes Labour leader. And I expect he'll become very high profile in the campaign to keep Britain in Europe, which is increasingly looking like it will be next May.He'll endorse a candidate in the next four weeks before nominations close. It will be very interesting to see who he piles in behind.Read more from Allegra (see post 13.23).Former Labour leader Lord Kinnock said he thought Mr Umunna had made the right decision.He said: ""If he felt in his soul that he wasn't prepared to subject himself - and more importantly his family - to the kind of attention which is fairly typical, sadly, these days, he has done absolutely the right thing.""There is no point at all in inflicting avoidable, unnecessary misery on those you love most.""Leadership contender Mary Creagh said she had ""huge respect"" for Mr Umunna, telling BBC Radio 4's World at One programme it took ""courage"" to withdraw from the leadership race.Mr Umunna was ""a big beast"" and would play a ""big role"" in the future of the Labour Party, she added.Yvette Cooper, Andy Burnham, Liz Kendall and Mary Creagh have already thrown their hats into the ring for Labour's top job while a number of other potential candidates, including Dan Jarvis, Alan Johnson and David Lammy, have ruled themselves out. Candidates must secure nominations from 34 colleagues - 15% of the party's MPs - by 15 June to make it on to ballot papers, which will be sent to members in August ahead of the leader's election a month later."

However, Mr Justice Stuart Smith at Southwark Crown Court said there was a ""very strong likelihood"" a custodial sentence would follow.The jury heard how Mote submitted numerous false expenses claims for payment for work that organisations had allegedly carried out on his behalf.Mote claimed the money was to pay whistleblowers in cash through third parties. He also said he had been ""targeted for being an anti-EU MEP.""During his time an MEP he also made £250,000 legitimate expenses claims.No date has been set for the sentencing."

2015-04-30,Round-up: BBC experts' analysis,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/election-2015-32650417,"The political future of the United Kingdom has become clearer after the results of the general election emerged around the country.David Cameron says he hopes to govern for all of the UK after the Conservatives took 331 seats - enough to form a slender majority in the Commons.Labour has been all but wiped out by the SNP in Scotland and suffered a disappointing set of results elsewhere, while the Lib Dems are left with just eight MPs after many party heavyweights such as Vince Cable and Danny Alexander lost their seats.So with battles won and lost and the fall-out and celebrations beginning, BBC correspondents examine the implications and challenges that lie ahead for the new government - and for those whose political careers have been ended by voters.No pollster, no pundit, no political leader saw it coming - not even David Cameron himself.Governing parties don't gain seats. Parties that have implemented painful cuts and are promising more certainly don't. Until that is the Conservative Party did - achieving what had seemed to be Mission Impossible - a Tory majority.Until that is David Cameron's personal triumph which triggered the near simultaneous resignation of his three principle opponents - Messrs Miliband, Clegg and Farage.They did so in part because they helped to crush their partners in coalition these last five years - reducing the Liberal Democrat parliamentary party to a size when it can fit into two London taxis and still have two seats to spare.In part because the extraordinary tidal wave of support for the SNP swept dozens of once safe Labour seats away.In part because Nigel Farage persuaded millions to vote for him but secured just one seat - not, though, the one he was standing in.Read more from Nick Robinson hereThe question uppermost in the prime minister's mind as he assembles his new government is how to keep the kingdom united.""Above all I want to bring our country together,"" he revealed after the result, ""to reclaim a mantle we should never have lost - the mantle of one nation, one United Kingdom"".Looking at the political landscape from Land's End today is very different to the view from John O'Groats.A sea of Conservative and Unionist blue dominates the scene across much of England, while a field of SNP nationalist yellow stretches to the horizon and beyond from the north.David Cameron's greatest challenge is to prevent the union he supports being torn apart by mutual resentment - resentment from Scotland at a Westminster government dominated by English Tories, and resentment from England at the preferential treatment people think is being given to the Scots.Those who assumed the future of the Union had been safeguarded by the Scottish referendum must think again.Read more from Mark Easton hereOne thing is rock-solid true: the Conservatives who worked on this campaign are as surprised by the result as the pollsters, pundits, politicians and general population.Maybe they shouldn't be - the economy is in good shape and the Conservatives had incumbency advantage.But when I travelled back from the prime minister's last rally with a group of exhausted Conservative campaign officials it was clear that 290 seats was a hoped-for target.No-one talked about anything over 300 seats, and no-one even mentioned an overall majority.So what special sauce pushed David Cameron into No 10 with a Commons majority?Mr Cameron had two simple messages in the campaign and he rarely veered away from them; the first - the economy is in good shape and the recovery is threatened by Labour. And the second - the SNP would hold a Labour-led government to ransom.Read more from Jonny Dymond hereBrian Taylor, BBC political editor, ScotlandOf all the comments on the overnight apocalypse, undoubtedly the most straightforward came from a defeated Scottish Labour MP.Since there were quite a few of them, let me narrow the focus a little. Come on down, Tom Harris.Mr Harris had plainly anticipated defeat. Nonetheless, he looked suitably lugubrious as his fate was confirmed.Why, he was asked eagerly, had Labour lost? ""Because we did not win enough votes.""Psephologically, it is perfect. Complete in itself. Psychologically, it sums up Labour's gloom without descending into subsidiary matters such as leadership, strategy and the rest. As a forward-thinking strategy, it is ideal. Win more votes. Simple.Read more from Brian Taylor hereThis has been an election which may have more profound consequences than almost any in living memory.We now face a generational decision about our future in Europe, with an EU referendum in two years' time almost certain.There will also be serious questions about the future of the Union, following an SNP landslide that has turned Scotland into a virtual one-party state.David Cameron's victory also represents a colossal achievement.Only once before in recent history has an incumbent government increased its majority - and that was Mrs Thatcher in her prime in the 1980s.It is also a significant personal victory for Mr Cameron and a rebuff for those in his party who had become increasingly sceptical about his ability to win.But while it may represent a defeat for those Tories who saw this election as a potential opportunity to rid themselves of David Cameron, he must now govern with a wafer-thin majority.For the SNP, their stunning victory can only increase the pressure on Nicola Sturgeon to include a commitment to a second independence referendum in her party's manifesto for next year's Scottish elections.It is an election which has not just defied all the predictions of the pollsters and pundits - but which may yet prompt the most fundamental re-casting of British politics for a generation.Read more from Norman Smith hereAfter an extraordinary night, some brief conclusions:Read more from James Landale hereIs this the end of the union?That is the question many people will be asking this morning after the party which has fought for Scottish independence for 80 years swept to victory.The answer from the jubilant Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon is a firm ""No"".She insists that her MPs will speak for all of Scotland, not just for the 45% who voted for the country to leave the United Kingdom last September.In the closing hours of the most extraordinary election campaign which anyone in Scotland can remember, Ms Sturgeon turned to talk of ""legitimacy.""That will be her watchword in the coming days as she argues that the prime minister cannot ignore the democratic will of the Scottish people.Politically, Scotland and England this morning look and feel like very different countries.Read more from James Cook hereAfter weeks of chatter about an election too close to call, it wasn't that close at all.David Cameron will be continuing as our prime minister.So, what is all this likely to mean?A referendum on whether the UK stays in, or leaves, the European Union, within the next two-and-a-half years.A race to be the next leader of the Labour Party.A race to be the next leader of the Liberal Democrats.And a huge new presence of Scottish National Party MPs at Westminster.And so here's another thing we know for certain this morning: Politics ain't going to be boring any time soon.Read more from Chris Mason hereFor Labour the story of their terrible night is rapidly turning into the search for a new leader. So who will that be?Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, is almost certain to run.  Even before this election, both he and another almost inevitable candidate, Chuka Umunna, had raised eyebrows inside the party at the work they had put in, preparing the ground with members and the unions for potential bids.Yvette Cooper, before the election, was still thought not to have made up her mind over whether to run. That decision has been made perhaps a little easier as her husband, Ed Balls, has lost his seat.She is certainly potentially in the frame, along with two lesser known names - Liz Kendall and Dan Jarvis - two MPs who were only elected in 2010 for the first time. This could be their moment. But whoever is in the job, they face a monumental task.Read Laura Kuenssberg's Twitter hereSterling is up (the most for seven years against the euro), share prices are up (especially bank shares like Lloyds and RBS, and energy shares such as Centrica), government bond prices are up.To state the obvious, investors love the Tories' general election victory.There are a few reasons.One (no surprise here) is that Labour's threat of breaking up banks and imposing energy price caps has been lifted.Second is that investors have been discounting days and weeks of wrangling after polling day over who would form the government - and so they are semi-euphoric that we already know who's in charge.Third, many investors tend to be economically conservative and instinctively Conservative.But although the City may be a bit drunk on the result, its pleasure in Ed Miliband's and Ed Balls' humiliation may be making it a bit blind - perhaps dangerously so - to some bumps in the economic road ahead.Read more from Robert Peston hereNigel Farage dreamed of holding the balance of power, but in the end his UKIP party is now worse off than when it came into the election.At the seventh time of asking he was rejected - this time by the people of Thanet South. It was a similar story in Rochester and Strood where Mark Reckless, who sensationally defected from the Tories last year, was also sent packing.In seats on UKIP's target list, like Thurrock in Essex, the party failed to make gains. In Grimsby - where Mr Farage went twice in the last six weeks - they came third.UKIP got around four million votes - with especially strong showings in north-east and south-east England - but it's ended up with just one MP, and a vacancy at the top. This has led to UKIP attacking the current system of choosing MPs, which it's described as ""busted"" and ""dysfunctional"".In one sense, this campaign was a complete failure and it's left an aftermath of angry voters, and others wondering if the UKIP bubble has burst.Read Robin Brant's Twitter hereI monitored 91 GB-wide voting intention polls during the 2015 election campaign and found nothing in them to prepare me for the final outcome.The good news for the pollsters was that their share for the Lib Dems was pretty close, as were the shares for UKIP, the Greens and the catch-all category of Others.The bad news for the polling industry was that the crucial shares for Conservative and Labour were the ones where they came most adrift.When all the qualifications of margins of error are allowed, there did appear to be a systematic overstatement of the Labour share and an equally systematic understatement of the Conservative one.It is for the pollsters to decide whether to conduct a review of their performance but I trust they will avoid the initial knee-jerk reaction of the immediate aftermath of the 1992 polls debacle.This general election performance follows the performance of the polls in the 2014 Scottish referendum where the choice was simply binary and yet all the polls were out by between 4-6%.Something is wrong. A lot of us would like to know what it is.Read more from David Cowling hereThe words ""political earthquake"" have been translated into numerous European languages, making front page news across the continent.While Britons now examine the domestic minutiae of the election result, here in mainland Europe the vote means one thing: a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU. And that has the potential to create an earthquake of its own.The guardian of the EU treaties Mr Cameron wants to change - Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker - has said again he'd listen to what Britain's new government proposed.Read more from Katya Adler here"

2015-04-30,A history of political plots,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32749971,"Nigel Farage has apparently seen off a challenge to his leadership of UKIP - a move described by his former election strategist as a ""coup"". He's not the only party leader to face an attempted ousting. But can you recover from such a revolt?In 2006, the Labour prime minister was the target of what became known as the ""curry house conspiracy"" - a coup to remove him and install his chancellor, Gordon Brown, as prime minister.It would lead to several of the plotters' resignations - but not Mr Blair's. However, it was successful to a degree in that it forced the party leader into naming a departure date.The move against him was reportedly masterminded by Tom Watson, a defence minister at the time, who was also rumoured to have had a secret meeting with Mr Brown on the eve of the revolt.Apparently, Mr Watson and three fellow West Midlands MPs - Sion Simon, David Wright (both ministerial aides) and Khalid Mahmood - met over a biryani at a Wolverhampton curry house to discuss the PM's future, before dispatching a missive calling for him to quit.The letter - which attracted the support of a number of normally loyal Labour MPs - was leaked to the press, and ultimately resulted in Mr Watson's resignation.In his parting letter, the West Bromwich East MP took a shot at the prime minister, who he said should step down in the interests of party and country.Mr Blair denounced his actions and branded the former minister ""disloyal, discourteous and wrong"", saying he would have sacked him if he had not resigned.But Mr Watson's departure was swiftly followed by the resignations of six other junior members of government - who had also signed the rebel letter - in protest at the prime minister's refusal to say when he would step down as Labour leader.The whole affair resulted in Mr Blair announcing his intention to step aside within 12 months - which he duly did, on 27 June 2007.But it did nothing to quash internal dissent and speculation in the party over the future leadership of the party.Labour prime minister Gordon Brown found his leadership under threat in 2009 after one of his cabinet ministers dramatically quit the government and called for him to resign.Work and Pensions Secretary James Purnell - a former aide to Tony Blair - resigned from his post after the polls closed in the local and European elections, in which Labour was forecast to do badly.Explaining his decision to quit, Mr Purnell said the prime minister made a Conservative victory ""more, not less, likely"".It was Mr Brown's first direct challenge from a cabinet minister - but it would not topple the Labour leader as senior members of government refused to follow Mr Purnell's lead.Mr Brown was safe for the time being. But several months later, in January 2010, a fresh leadership challenge was mounted by two senior former Labour cabinet ministers.Geoff Hoon and Patricia Hewitt wrote to all Labour MPs, saying the party was ""deeply divided"" over Mr Brown's leadership and that the best way to resolve the issue was by way of secret ballot.They insisted it was not an ""attempted coup"" but a necessary step to resolve divisions within the party.But the duo could only muster the public support of a handful of backbenchers long-opposed to Mr Brown, with the majority of the party's MPs less than impressed by the move, which came just weeks before the general election.As the day wore on, a succession of cabinet ministers came out to back the PM, suggesting there was little momentum behind the plot - although it was noted that several were not exactly gushing in their support of Mr Brown.As history tells us, neither leadership challenge bore fruit but they reflected the internal doubts and divisions over Mr Brown at the helm.As leadership toppling attempts go, this one in 2014 was regarded as a particularly ""botched"" and ""shambolic coup"". Indeed, former Lib Dem leader Lord (Paddy) Ashdown described the move as a ""plot of deep malice"".Its instigator, Lord (Matthew) Oakeshott - a close ally of the-then Business Secretary Vince Cable - tried to unseat Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg.The peer was found to have commissioned secret polls suggesting the party would do better at the 2015 general election without Mr Clegg in the driving seat.The man Lord Oakeshott had long had in mind to take Mr Clegg's place - Mr Cable, who was on government business in China at the time - was forced to publicly condemn his friend's actions and state his backing for Mr Clegg.But Lord Oakeshott said the business secretary had in fact known about his polls and their findings.Nevertheless, the peer - who was denounced by the Lib Dem leadership for spending money that could have been spent on campaigning - quit the party, and issued a warning shot on his way out about the Lib Dems' future prospects.Mr Cable largely emerged unscathed but he faced questions about his loyalty to the leader. Although the two sought to put paid to reports of a rift with a (painfully awkward, 'nothing to see here, folks') stage-managed pint in a pub.Although the revolt failed, and Mr Clegg remained at the helm, the Lib Dems did go on to suffer a trouncing at the general election, losing nearly 50 of its MPs - one of them, Mr Cable himself - prompting his leader to quit.The Conservatives have a reputation for being more ruthless than their party rivals when it comes to getting rid of leaders they sense are no longer effectual.But, in 1995, Prime Minister John Major - tired of persistent rumours of a leadership challenge - decided to take the bull by the horns and trigger a surprise leadership election to silence his detractors.His own backbenchers had questioned Mr Major's ability to unite and lead the party, which was deeply divided over Europe.So ""put up or shut up"", he told them as he tendered his resignation as Conservative Party leader but not prime minister.But then stepped forward eurosceptic MP John Redwood, who resigned from the cabinet in order to contest Mr Major's leadership.This was unexpected by many, as the PM had said there had been assurances from his cabinet that none would stand against him.But Mr Major went on to win the ensuing election with a comfortable defeat over his challenger, who was not included in the PM's consequent cabinet reshuffle.No further contested leadership election took place until after the Conservatives' defeat at the 1997 general election, paving the way for William Hague to take over the running of the party.Not all attempts to oust a party leader end in failure: as Margaret Thatcher found out to her peril.With three electoral victories under her belt, the Conservative prime minister's downfall would come at the hands of her own party - not the voters.It was on 1 November 1990 when Geoffrey (now Lord) Howe - one of Mrs Thatcher's longest-serving ministers - resigned over differences with the party leader over Europe.In his now infamous speech on the floor of the House of Commons, he attacked the PM's policies and leadership style, comparing being one of her cabinet ministers to opening the batting at cricket only to find his bat had been ""broken... by the team captain"".It sparked the beginning of the end of the 11-year Thatcher reign.Michael (now Lord) Heseltine seized on the opportunity to challenge the prime minister in the ensuing leadership contest, from which she would eventually withdraw and John Major emerge as her successor. Reflecting on the revolt and its implications on the Conservative Party, Baroness Thatcher's biographer Charles Moore wrote: ""Because the coup was unjustified, and so trust broke down, the politics of the next 15 years were those of civil war."""
2015-04-30,Election swings and roundabouts,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-32741924,"If election manifesto claims are all about smoke and mirrors, should we now add swings and roundabouts to the political metaphor?There's an intriguing aspect to the general election results in the Midlands that puzzled me.It's the striking contrast in the swings between Labour and the Conservatives.David Cameron and his campaign strategists knew they were home and dry when Nuneaton was the first Midlands marginal to declare.It was not only a Tory hold but a swing to the Conservatives from Labour of 3%.I was in the Nottingham suburb of Beeston awaiting the result of the Broxtowe count. Would its high profile Conservative MP Anna Soubry survive a red surge?Nuneaton set the pattern. Across the Midlands, both east and west, there was a uniform swing of between three and four per cent to the Tories - Warwickshire North 3%, Amber Valley 4%, Derbyshire South 4% and Sherwood 4%. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan topped the Tory swingometer in the Midlands marginals with 5% in Loughborough.Yet in the big cities, it was a very different story. The swing went to Labour.So in Nottingham East they enjoyed a 6% swing, Nottingham South 5.8%, Leicester South 7.3%, Leicester West 5%, Birmingham Hall Green 12%, Birmingham Hodge Hill 8%.If swings to Labour on this scale had gone beyond the city ring road roundabouts and into the suburbs, Ed Miliband would have become prime minister by now.In confidence, one senior Labour insider in Nottingham told me its success in the city wards was down to organisation, experience and its teams of activists.""We won the ground war. If Nottingham's city boundaries were extended into Sherwood and Broxtowe, we would have won those constituencies as well,"" he told me.Labour leadership candidate, Leicester West's Liz Kendall has identified her party's problem beyond the ring road roundabout.It's about reaching out to Middle England.""We need to show people that we understand their aspirations and ambitions for the future,"" she told the Sunday Times.The problem for Labour was that Middle England was not interested in what the party offered…and still isn't. The Cameron brand worked its magic in those Midlands marginals... it'll take something or someone special to break up that ballot box relationship."
2015-04-30,Royal 'lobbying',https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32740154,"Prince Charles sent 27 letters to then Prime Minister Tony Blair and members of his government between September 2004 and March 2005, ""despite the Freedom of Information Act!"" as the prince joked in one.But did his suggestions and concerns have any bearing on the behaviour of Mr Blair's government?The request: Prince Charles expresses his worries over an EU directive on complementary medicines ""which is… effectively outlawing the use of certain herbal extracts"".  Mr Blair replied, offering moral support and practical help. He agreed that ""the implementation as it is currently planned is crazy"" and set out an action plan that included delaying implementation for all existing products to 2011. What happened: Herbal products were not required to be authorised until 2011, just as Mr Blair had promised. Prince Charles continues to sell his own brand of complementary products, Duchy Herbals, through Boots and Waitrose. The request: Writing to Mr Blair, the prince expresses a ""growing sense of anxiety"" that the Hill Farming Allowance, which supports farmers working on Britain's uplands, could be scrapped. In his reply, the prime minister said he understood that the Hill Farm Allowance would continue until 2007. What happened: The allowance lasted until the end of Labour's tenure in 2010, when it was abolished.The request: Just 18 months after the US-led invasion of Iraq, Prince Charles raised the issue of poor performance of Lynx helicopters in high temperatures, saying: ""I fear that this is just one more example of where our Armed Forces are being asked to do an extremely challenging job (particularly in Iraq) without the necessary resources.""Mr Blair replied: ""On the subject of the Lynx helicopter, the limitations of the existing platform, particularly in the extremely challenging environment within Iraq, are well recognised by the Ministry of Defence."" He added that replacement of the helicopters would be a priority. What happened: Mr Blair's comments go much further than what he was saying about the subject at the time. In the event, though, the fleet was not fully upgraded until 2011.The request: Prince Charles lamented that the government's TB prevention plans might not ""include a commitment to deal with the badger problem in the immediate future"" and pushed strongly for a cull, saying: ""All I can say is that I do urge you to look again at introducing a proper cull of badgers where it is necessary.""Mr Blair sympathised, saying he could ""personally see the case for culling badgers"". However, he was unwilling to commit to a cull.  What happened: Culling trials were conducted from 1998-2005. The final results, published in 2008, said that the badger cull could ""make no meaningful contribution"" to curbing bovine TB. It wasn't until 2013 that a full culling programme began in two pilot areas. These ended with the conclusion that the pilots had been neither humane nor effective at curbing the spread of TB.The request: Then Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell wrote to Prince Charles to say she had decided to give parts of the historic Smithfield meat market Grade II listed status, and was trying to persuade deputy prime minister John Prescott to ""call in"" the planning application to prevent demolition of other parts of the site. She had been swayed by evidence provided by Sir Neil Cossons, who was English Heritage chair at the time, after he had been asked by the prince to add his support. Prince Charles replied that he was ""extremely glad to read of your appreciation of the value of this group of buildings"". According to the Guardian, market workers desperate to see the redevelopment of the site invited the prince to meet them to discuss it, but his office said he was ""unlikely to accept as he did not want to interfere in the planning process"".What happened: Smithfield market is still the subject of planning battles a decade on. Successive planning applications have been refused by ministers. Last year then Communities Secretary Eric Pickles rejected plans for an office development on the site, stating that ""the extent of damage that the application would cause to the important heritage assets at Smithfield runs entirely counter to national and policy objectives intended to protect such assets from harm"".In March, the Museum of London announced a move from its current Barbican site to the Smithfield market building."
2015-04-30,Election fallout,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32703139,"""Some of those gimmicks - that tombstone, whatever idiot thought that up I do not know!""I was talking to the former Mayor of Crawley in Sussex, John Mortimer, in the town's Labour Supporters Club about the vexed question of what went wrong, and where Labour should go next. This seat is one of those southern seats Labour hoped to take, but failed.I hear a whole range of views in the club.""They didn't give nothing to depend on, they should be clear, and a little bit more down to Earth."" ""Good party, wrong leader, they don't look after business enough.""Councillor John Stanley tells me: ""I think in a way we did go too left, but now we can go a bit centre-left, or centre, depending who the new leader is.""The former mayor sums up the mood on the doorstep: ""Whatever we told them, they didn't believe us.""  Expect to hear all those views, and more, in the coming leadership contest. Step back from the angst of supporters, and it may not be that hard to see why Labour failed.  An economic recovery, hailed by independent organisations as the result of government policy, undid a party that had loudly proclaimed for five years that the coalition's policies would lead to economic disaster. Combine that with an uncharismatic and uninspirational leader, then you might argue no further debate is necessary.Fat chance of that. Defeat breeds resentment, and this one has opened up old divisions.  A chorus of Blairties, led by the man himself, has declared that Ed's problem was ignoring those with aspiration and ambition, failing to appeal to those running business. Incidentally, I've been ticked off by the perspicacious editor of the New Statesman, Jason Cowley, for using the ""unhelpful"" term ""Blairites"".I can't think of another description that fits Tony, Lord Mandelson, Lord Adonis and David Miliband quite so well. But call them what you will, the message was clear - Ed was too left wing, Labour should move back to the centre, or, if you like, to the right.Reading Mr Blair's pithy analysis, listening to Lord Mandelson's gripping and savage eloquence, describing a party sent out to shout: ""We love the poor and hate the rich,"" and so ignoring the middle, and you realise strong emotions are in play.But back to the future may not be sufficient. Of course elections are won on the centre ground. But grandees grinding axes, affronted by the failure of boys who used to make their tea, may be creating so much noise that they can't hear more insistent sounds.  For there are several elephants trumpeting loudly as they cram into the small space of the shadow cabinet room. Imagine these beasts are as gaily decorated as Berlin buddy bears. One is decked out in red, another in imperial purple bunting, and another, a mammoth, strong tusked and ice rimmed, painted yellow with tartan trimmings.Take the last first. The Scottish wipeout is Labour's biggest problem. Fail to solve it, and Labour can forget ever having a comfortable majority again. It is hard to argue Labour were wiped out in Scotland because the SNP outflanked them to the right with their appeal to the business community and the ambitious and aspirational. But it is true the SNP drew in to people from left, right and centre, just as the modernisers say Labour should. It was the politics of economic self-interest, but cast in a very different light. Tribally sneering at ""the reactionary ideology of nationalism"" as Mr Blair does, will not reach the central belt of Scotland, the middle ground of  Midlothian.What about that purple pachyderm?  In Crawley - in fact in seat after seat - there is a similar pattern.  Labour did, in fact, often increase the size of their vote. So did the Conservatives, usually by a bit more. But the real dynamic was the total collapse of the Lib Dems and the dramatic rise of UKIP. The increase in votes for Nigel Farage's party wasn't translated into parliamentary seats, but, although it is early days in terms of research, it probably hurt Labour a lot. If we believe - and I do - Matthew Goodwin and Rob Ford, authors of Revolt on the Right, these voters are often former Labour supporters - older, less educated, those left behind on the tides of  globalisation, stranded on the shores of post-industrialisation. They may have had too many disappointments to feel much ambition or aspiration. They are a challenge for Labour, and any new leader will spend a good deal of time thinking how to deal with the concerns of Europe and immigration.Whether to share their fears, or confront them will be a big decision.Which brings us to Red Nellie. Those members who still proudly call themselves socialist. This is not about Old Labour - they are more likely to be baristas or barristers than boilermakers. It is easy as an outsider, as a journalist, to treat politics as an intellectual game about how best to win power - but many people, particularly the foot soldiers, particularly after the death of  purely tribal loyalties, are in it because they passionately believe in winning  power to do something specific.Many of them are suspicious of the later incarnations of New Labour, not because it reached an accommodation with wealth and business, but because it seemed to worship at the same altar, to regard the party's core beliefs in redistribution and equality as childish fantasies from a past age.Perhaps to Mr Blair, they are the problem, people who may equate ""ambition"" with greed. They might point out that a man who claims to be worth ""only"" £20m may find it harder than most to squeeze through the eye of a needle to understand their point of view. Most successful Labour leaders will confront the left at some point, but the concerns of this group go to the existential question ""What is the party for?""This is not a polemic - not an argument about what should be done, but a reflection on the complex conundrums that will face any new Labour leader, the tearing apart of the old alliance that made up a Labour majority, and so the political need to satisfy groups with very different, indeed, contradictory demands. But looking for a Social Democratic universal theory of everything may be missing the point. What the party desperately wants is a leader who can pull the disparate threads together and articulate them as common purpose. Whether she or he exists is another matter.Much more on that in the coming months."
2015-04-30,'Take us with you',https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-32736153,"Thousands of people in the north of England have been using the hashtag ""take us with you Scotland"" to express their upset about the result of last week's general election, and Scottish nationalists are welcoming this English minority with open arms. Last Thursday's general election was a rough one for the Labour Party in its traditional stronghold in the north of England. But further to the north, the left-leaning Scottish National Party won nearly every seat it contested. That political contrast has made some left-wing voters in places like Manchester, Leeds and Sheffield look fondly on their neighbours. Since last Thursday's election in Britain the phrase ""take us with you Scotland"" has been used more than 24,000 times. ""Genuinely beginning to wonder if the North of England becoming a part of Scotland would be better for us, I really am,"" tweeted Aaron Miller from Yorkshire. Some cracked jokes under the tag after the North West Motorway Police account, which gives traffic updates, announced that they had ""picked up a pedestrian on the M62 who was trying to walk to Scotland.""After an initial spike of jokes over the weekend, the hashtag really took off when users start to mobilise in support of around a year-old petition on the campaigning site Change.org. The petition calls for the north of England to secede from the rest of the country and join up with Scotland, and more than 12,000 people have signed it.Its creator, a Sheffield resident who calls himself ""Stu Dent"", set it up to coincide with last year's Scottish independence referendum, and he also created a map imagining the boundary of a ""Scotland plus the north"" country.Stu Dent runs the Twitter account Hunters Bar, named after an area of southwest Sheffield which is very popular with - you guessed it - students. Despite the account having thousands of followers on Twitter, when the map was first posted last year, the image was shared only about 100 times - however, in the past week it's been retweeted by thousands. Stu Dent told BBC Trending that he was surprised at how popular his idea has become. ""In hindsight, perhaps I shouldn't have been,"" he said. ""There is a huge frustration in parts of the UK about the things that have happened since 2010.""""I think people need a place to go where they can say 'not in my name! This is not the England I want',"" he added. But in addition to disappointment from some quarters about the election result, there might be another reason why the petition is getting a boost now: the power of the Scottish Nationalists on Twitter. What started as a post-election joke in the North of England was quickly embraced by the so-called ""Cyber Nats"" - and a trend was born.The SNP's social media strategist Ross Colquhoun expressed the party's mood about the hashtag best, in a post which was shared more than 500 times. ""2014: #LetsStayTogether 2015: #TakeUsWithYouScotland What a difference a year makes"" he tweeted.Blog by Hannah HendersonNext story: The sport reporter and the obscene ranter who lost his jobFollow BBC Trending on Twitter @BBCtrending, and find us on Facebook."
2015-04-30,What Britain wants from Europe,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32695399,"David Cameron says he has a mandate to pursue EU reform following the Conservatives' general election victory. The PM, who will be hoping his majority government will give him extra leverage in Brussels, wants to renegotiate the terms of the UK's membership ahead of a referendum by the end of 2017. He has said he will campaign for Britain to remain in the EU if he gets the reforms he wants.Mr Cameron has said he does not want to reveal full details of his negotiating hand but he has given a broad indication, in a series of speeches and newspaper articles, of his priorities when he goes into talks with other EU leaders.These are: The prime minister has said Britain would resist any move towards a European Army and that he wants to free British police forces from EU interference. He has also ruled out Britain joining the euro.But he has placed less emphasis in recent years on demanding changes to EU social policy, such as the maximum 48-hour working week, agency workers, maternity leave and non-discrimination rules.The official UK government position is that a referendum will be held by the end of 2017 but Downing Street sources have said: ""If we can do it earlier we will.""There is speculation David Cameron is planning to hold the vote in 2016 to avoid a clash with French and German elections in 2017.The prime minister wants treaty change but even if the referendum was held in 2017 there may not be enough time to legally incorporate any reforms into a treaty and it would have to be done at a later stage.An early referendum would anger Eurosceptics who believe it would not allow enough time to make the case for exit or negotiate any meaningful concessions.""A rushed process would severely undermine the chances to secure a significant deal that both British business and voters could support and would waste the opportunity of a lifetime,"" Matthew Elliott, chief executive of Business for Britain told Breitbart London.The question is always crucial in any referendum and there is already a debate about what it should be. The Draft European Union (Referendum) Bill, published by the Conservatives in 2013, proposed this form of words: ""Do you think that the United Kingdom should remain a member of the European Union?""Some thought that leaned too far towards the status quo, encouraging a yes vote, and the Electoral Commission said it was not clear and direct enough. The watchdog proposed this form of words instead: ""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union?""The new Conservative government will attempt to repeal the Human Rights Act, which requires UK courts to treat the European Court of Human Rights as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. The European Court of Human Rights is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe (CoE), which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine.The freedom for people to move around Europe, enshrined in the EU treaties, works in parallel with the other three basic freedoms in the single market: freedom of goods, capital and services.It is likely to be a ""red line"" for other EU leaders, who do not want to see it eroded.Mr Cameron has steered clear of tackling it directly - for example by asking for an emergency ""brake"" on free movement, or a cap on numbers - focusing instead on reducing the incentive provided by welfare payments. In a speech last November, David Cameron set out measures to reduce the number of EU nationals moving to the UK.His main proposals were:Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission, has said he is ready to work with Mr Cameron to ""strike a fair deal for the United Kingdom in the EU"". The leaders of other EU nations have previously warned they are unlikely to support major changes to EU treaties to accommodate British demands. But Mr Cameron's general election victory may have given him extra leverage. ""The ball is very much in the court of the UK now,"" a senior EU official told The Guardian. ""It's up to the British to define what they want."" The key figure will be German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is very keen to keep Britain in the EU but has so far been unwilling to make major concessions to enable that to happen. There are fears that a ""pick and mix"" approach to EU treaties would undermine EU cohesion.Mr Cameron has said there is ""no doubt"" his planned reforms will require changes to the treaties governing the European Union. But this would require the unanimous support of all EU members, and may not be possible within the deadline he has set of a referendum before the end of 2017. Any attempt to change EU laws on free movement would meet fierce resistance from some EU nations, particularly Eastern European states. Mr Juncker has said free movement is non-negotiable.Mr Cameron may find it difficult to get unanimous support for his proposals for a four-year waiting period for migrant workers claiming UK benefits. East European EU members would be likely to oppose this, on the grounds that it would discriminate against their citizens.  Attempts to secure opt-outs for the City are unlikely to go down well with other European leaders.However, there are precedents for EU treaty changes to accommodate some countries' specific concerns - for example, the protocol attached to the Lisbon Treaty for Ireland.Mr Cameron has faced repeated calls to say whether he would campaign for Britain's exit from the EU in the referendum if he fails to get what he wants from the renegotiation process. All he has said is that he will ""rule nothing out"". Some Conservative MPs want Britain to leave the EU no matter what David Cameron manages to renegotiate. A larger group are likely to want more concessions than Mr Cameron has so far indicated he is prepared to demand.Senior backbencher David Davis, who was defeated by Mr Cameron for the Tory leadership in 2005, told the Daily Telegraph the majority of the 332 Conservative MPs want Mr Cameron to negotiate an ""opt-out"" power to stop individual EU laws from applying to Britain. The prime minister has said this would be ""impossible"" without Britain leaving the EU.Mr Davis claims as many as 60 Tory MPs would be prepared to rebel and vote for Britain's exit from the EU if the prime minister fails to deliver.Graham Brady, chairman of the Tory backbench 1922 committee, which represents backbenchers, has urged David Cameron to give all Conservative MPs, including ministers, a free vote in the EU referendum.In January, Mr Cameron warned that serving cabinet ministers would have to quit the government if they wanted to campaign to leave the EU if he had secured the reforms to it he wants.In the 1975 referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Economic Community, as the EU was then called, Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson decided to suspend collective responsibility because his cabinet was split on the issue. Ministers were allowed to vote with their consciences and campaign against each other. The majority of them, including Mr Wilson, joined the Yes camp, but left-wingers, such as Tony Benn, played a leading role in the No campaign. The Yes campaign won easily with 67% of the vote."
