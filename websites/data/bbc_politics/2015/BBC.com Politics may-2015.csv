2015-05-01,Scots Labour leader Murphy to resign,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32760196,"Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy is to resign next month, he has announced.It comes despite Mr Murphy narrowly surviving a vote of no confidence at a meeting of the party's national executive in Glasgow. Mr Murphy said he would tender his resignation alongside a plan to reform the party.He lost his seat in last week's general election as the SNP won 56 of the 59 Scottish seats, leaving Labour with a single MP in Scotland.Mr Murphy said he wanted to have a successor as leader in place by the summer, and confirmed he would not be standing for a seat at the Scottish Parliament in next year's election. Instead, he said it was time to ""do something else"" and that he believed the party would continue to be divided if he remained as leader. His deputy, Kezia Dugdale MSP, will become acting leader until a permanent successor is found. Mr Murphy had faced calls to resign from several MSPs, trade unions and former MPs in the wake of his party's near wipeout at the general election.He insisted he had decided to stand down ahead of the national executive voting by 17-14 in favour of him staying in the job.Speaking at a media conference after the national executive meeting, he said: ""It is clear that a small minority who didn't accept my election as leader of the Scottish Labour Party just five months ago won't accept the vote of the executive today and that will continue to divide the party.""Today I received more support in the executive vote than I did from members of the executive when I stood for election five months ago.""He said it would be up to the executive whether to accept the reforms he would be proposing before he left the post. But he warned: ""A party in such urgent need of reform blocks those changes at its peril.""The former East Renfrewshire MP said Labour had been crushed between ""two nationalisms"" in Scotland and England.Mr Murphy said he left no legacy of bitterness for anyone in the Labour Party, and the only person he was angry at was the person who blamed Scottish Labour for the party's UK-wide general election defeat - a reference to Unite leader Len McCluskey.And he said that in many ways Scottish Labour was the ""least modernised part of the Labour movement"" and that he wanted his successor to be elected under a one member, one vote system.Mr Murphy added: ""The Labour Party's problem is not the link with trade unions, or even the relationship with Unite members - far from it. It is the destructive behaviour of one high profile trade unionist.""The leader of the Scottish Labour Party doesn't serve at the grace of Len McCluskey, and the next leader of the UK Labour Party should not be picked by Len McCluskey.""Mr McCluskey has been a vocal critic of Mr Murphy's leadership and opposed his appointment in December when Mr Murphy won the contest to replace Johann Lamont.Jim Murphy laughed and joked with Scottish Labour's sole MP as he made his way down the hotel corridor to announce his resignation.He certainly brought energy and dynamism to his election campaign - but all that achieved was Ian Murray in Edinburgh South.So as Mr Murphy bows out, who could replace him?The deputy leader Kezia Dugdale may want to step up or Neil Findlay could try again after challenging last time. Maybe the party's finance spokeswoman Jackie Baillie thinks her steady hand could steer the ship.Jenny Marra is also often talked about as future face of the party.Whoever steps into Jim Murphy's red shoes he or she will have to face a difficult 2016 Holyrood election, to put it mildly.There are also more fundamental questions about how the party can possibly move on as it faces a surging SNP.Mr Murphy was very much a creature of ""New Labour"" - but to today's generation that's old Labour.Party members may start looking for someone with no links to the past, neither a Brownite nor a Blairite. A 'cleanskin' - as the politicos put it - may well help re-connect with voters.That's a long way from now though - even some of the party's opponents may view this latest train wreck with a modicum of sympathy. Ms Lamont had resigned after claiming Scottish Labour was treated like a ""branch office"" by the London-based party leadership.Mr Murphy concluded his speech by saying: ""Scotland needs a strong Labour party; Scotland needs a united Labour party. We have been the greatest force for change in our nation's remarkable history. ""The Scottish Labour party will rise again. It will be under someone else's leadership and I am confident about my party's future.""Harriet Harman MP, acting leader of the UK Labour Party, said it would be for Scottish Labour to choose a new leader. She added: ""As a cabinet minister and leader of his party in Scotland, Jim has been a hugely important figure in the Labour Party. He leaves with the best wishes and thanks of our movement.""Labour peer Lord McConnell, a former Scottish first minister, said the party's problems were ""much deeper than one individual and one affiliate"".He said: ""We have a disconnect locally and nationally with wider Scottish society. ""We have a problem with our political positioning in the post devolution age where the party particularly at the UK level has never been comfortable with success in the Scottish parliament and has always tried to see things through a UK prism rather than a Scottish prism.""We need to find a new generation, a new leader, new generation, new ideas, a fresh approach.""In a tweet, Scottish first minister and SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said: ""I wish Jim Murphy all the very best for the future. Leadership is not easy and he deserves credit for standing up for what he believes in.""Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson also reacted on Twitter, saying: ""Jim Murphy announces a managed exit in order to help the party, which is to his credit. But leaves a tough gig for whoever comes next.""The meeting of Scottish Labour's executive was disrupted by protesters who entered the party's headquarters.Police were called and the protesters, who included persistent anti-austerity activists Sean Clerkin and Piers Doughty-Brown, left the building to protest further from the street outside.The protesters were calling for Mr Murphy to remain as leader to ""finish the job of destroying Scottish Labour"".A Police Scotland spokeswoman said officers had been called and found two protestors on the third floor of the building. She added: ""Both left on police arrival. Advice and assistance was given."""
2015-05-01,Labour contenders clash on spending,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32761561,"Prospective Labour leaders have clashed over Labour's record in government in their first public debate in the race to succeed Ed Miliband.Former cabinet ministers including Yvette Cooper and Andy Burnham defended Labour's fiscal record and spending on schools and hospitals.However, candidates from the 2010 intake of MPs argued that the party spent too much while in office.The debate followed Chuka Umunna's withdrawal from the leadership contest.The remaining candidates appeared at the annual conference of the Progress think tank in London.There was agreement that Labour needed to demonstrate economic credibility to regain power, with shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt telling the meeting that the party needed to be ""trusted with public finances and the family finances"".Mr Hunt, who was first elected to Parliament in 2010 when Labour lost power, argued the last Labour government ""spent too much"" and failed to ""leave enough economic headroom to deal with the economic crisis and the recession"".Shadow health minister Liz Kendall said: ""There's absolutely nothing progressive about spending more on debt interest payments than on educating our children.""But shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: ""The Tories have had a triumph of spin over the facts in saying what they said about the economic record of the last Labour government.""The former chief secretary to the Treasury said the deficit did ""grow too large"" in the government's later years but insisted: ""The last Labour government ran more surpluses in its first term than the Tories did in 18 years.""Yvette Cooper, another former chief secretary to the Treasury, said: ""We should never let anybody tell us that it was too many teachers, doctors or nurses that caused Lehman Brothers bank in New York to crash.""Shadow international development secretary Mary Creagh said: ""People have forgotten the economic credibility that the last Labour government had.""She said Labour had built schools and hospitals that were ""treasured in our communities"".Ms Cooper, Mr Burnham, Ms Kendall and Ms Creagh have declared their intention to run for leader, while Mr Hunt told the conference he would make an announcement next week.At the same event, shadow energy secretary Caroline Flint announced she would be running for deputy leader.The Don Valley MP told the Today programme ahead of the debate that Labour lost the election because ""fundamentally the public did not trust us on the economy"".Exeter MP Ben Bradshaw has already announced a bid to be deputy, saying Labour ""must and could win the next election"", but only if it ""broadens its appeal by adopting sensible, centre-left politics which celebrate wealth creation and entrepreneurship"".Former Labour campaign co-ordinator Tom Watson is reported to be crowd-funding a deputy leadership bid, while Walthamstow MP Stella Creasy has said she is ""open to the question"" of running.Barnsley East MP and shadow transport secretary Michael Dugher - a fierce critic of Ed Miliband's election campaign - is to run Mr Burnham's campaign, according to the website LabourList.It is reported that Mr Burnham also has the backing of Labour peer Lord Falconer, who was lord chancellor and justice secretary under Tony Blair and was close to the former PM.Shadow culture secretary Chris Bryant has signalled his backing for Ms Cooper, tweeting that the next leader must be ""someone who's been tried in the fiery furnace of public opinion"".Mr Hunt said on Friday he would be be attending the debate - along with the other four hopefuls - to ""set out my analysis on how we begin to understand what went so wrong and why"".He added: ""We must use this leadership election to ask some very profound questions.""All voices in the party must be heard so that we can have a full and proper assessment as to why the politics of nationalism triumphed in Scotland and huge swathes of England, and how we have allowed the Conservative Party to present a more compelling vision for Britain to so many millions of people.""Speculation still surrounds shadow business secretary Mr Umunna's decision to pull out on Friday, when he said he was not ""comfortable"" with the ""pressure"" of being a candidate.As well as citing extensive pressure and scrutiny Mr Umunna also said he was ruling himself out because of concerns about the impact of the bid on his family.A rising star of the party, Mr Umunna was first elected to Parliament in 2010 - alongside Tristram Hunt and Liz Kendall - before joining the shadow cabinet.Asked about the candidate who might win, Conservative Chancellor George Osborne said: ""The Labour leadership contest has descended into farce.""But it's not actually about personalities. I don't think the Labour Party any more represents the working people of this country who aspire to a better life."""
2015-05-01,Carswell clarifies comments on Farage,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32771030,"Nigel Farage should take a break ""as leader"" of UKIP but not a break from being leader, the party's only MP says.Douglas Carswell also told the BBC's Sunday Politics that the party needed to ensure it got the ""tone"" right in order to attract more voters.It comes after Mr Carswell said in an article in the Times on Saturday that Mr Farage ""needs to take a break now"".A bitter internal row has developed within UKIP after Mr Farage's resignation was rejected by the party.Mr Carswell said: ""I'm suggesting he takes a break as leader. I'm not suggesting he takes a break from being leader.""Clearly the national executive has the authority, they're the ruling body. ""I'm told that they made a decision. I'm told it was a procedurally correct decision, he is the leader but I think it's important that as leader he takes a break and I think it's important that we work out how these complex questions are answered by a team.""No one person has all the answers. I'm particularly concerned about tone, making sure we get a tone that ensures that the 27 million people who didn't vote for UKIP last week may be persuaded to vote for us in future.""The party has been beset by wrangling since Mr Farage agreed to stay on as leader, days after standing down after failing to get elected in Thanet South.He had pledged before the general election that he would quit the post if he failed to get elected to Parliament.Senior aide Matthew Richardson has left the party, following claims from MEP Patrick O'Flynn that Mr Farage had fallen under the influence of ""inexperienced"" advisers.UKIP has also confirmed the departure of Mr Farage's chief of staff Raheem Kassam.Mr Farage ruled out quitting as leader on BBC's Question Time on Thursday, saying he had ""phenomenal"" support, and has challenged his critics to decide whether they want to stay in the party.In his article, Mr Carswell had said that ""knowing how difficult it is to lead a party makes me admire Nigel Farage all the more"".""I know that I never could,"" he added, stressing that he would find it ""impossible to simultaneously lead UKIP, be the voice of the party in the Commons, represent my Clacton constituents and at the same time be a husband and a dad"".However, he said that ""even leaders need to take a break"", adding: ""Nigel needs to take a break now.""UKIP got nearly four million votes at the election, but returned only one MP - former Conservative Mr Carswell in the Clacton constituency."
2015-05-01,Coasting schools 'must improve',https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/education-32763097,"Education Secretary Nicky Morgan has said new powers to sack head teachers in coasting schools will show ""it is not OK to be just above the level of failing"". Under the plans, ministers could force schools rated as ""requiring improvement"" and missing new government benchmarks to become an academy.Coasting schools have average results which have often flatlined over time.Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, Mrs Morgan said faster action was needed.She said: ""Our big priorities will be to speed up the process for tackling failing schools; extend our academies programme to tackle 'coasting' schools; and deliver on our commitment to open new free schools.""The proposals will be in a new bill due to be introduced in the Queen's Speech. ""First, we will take new powers to step in from the moment that a school is found to be failing,"" Mrs Morgan said.""From day one, regional schools commissioners will be able to bring in new leadership and support from other excellent schools and heads, and we will speed up the process of turning schools into academies to make sure that new expert leadership is found for all schools that need it as quickly as possible.""She said that coasting schools will be put on an immediate notice to improve and could then be taken over and turned into an academy.They will be required to work with a team of ""expert"" head teachers.She said: ""Those that aren't able to demonstrate a clear plan for improvement will be given new leadership - we know this works in turning schools around.""More than 3,300 schools in England are labelled ""requires improvement"", but the plans are unlikely to cover that many schools.Under the current system, secondary schools are considered to be failing, and therefore eligible for intervention, if fewer than 40% of their students score at least five Cs at GCSE, including English and maths, and they do not meet national averages in pupil progress.In primary schools, the threshold for intervention is if fewer than 65% of pupils get Level 4 in reading, writing and maths and a below average number of pupils make the expected amount of progress.It is not yet clear how coasting schools will be deemed in need of intervention.It is understood that a new category will be devised covering schools which are rated as ""requires improvement"" and which fail to meet a new set of standards on improvement."
2015-05-01,Co-op Group to keep political funding,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-32762858,"The Co-operative Group has decided to continue financially supporting the Co-operative Party, which has strong ties to Labour.Members of the group, the UK's biggest mutual organisation, voted on the issue at their annual general meeting.They passed a motion by 48,579 for, to 39,479 against, to approve ""political expenditures"" of up to £1m which support the movement's objectives.Last year the Co-op Group gave £625,000 to the Co-op Party.This figure was down on the sums donated in previous years. The AGM also included a vote on new corporate governance procedures which would mean members having less of a direct say.The Co-operative Group is still recovering from a period of financial mismanagement and some members have recently expressed concerns about how elections to the board are chosen.The banking arm of the group came close to collapse in 2013, bringing the whole group to a £2.5bn annual loss that year. The Co-op Party includes among its members a number of Labour MPs, including shadow chancellor Chris Leslie and Walthamstow MP Stella Creasy. The politicians stand as candidates of both the Co-operative Party and the Labour Party, and the two political movements have strong historical ties. The board asked the members of the Co-operative Group whether they wanted to continue financially supporting the Co-operative Party, or any other party. Allan Leighton, chairman of the Co-op Group, said: ""There's a clear remit from the members to continue to support the Labour Party.""It allows us to now have a conversation with the Co-op Labour Party about what we do next.""There was also a members' motion on the agenda, put forward by those in favour of making political donations of up to £1m a year.The motion to approve political funding ""not to exceed £1m per annum"" was carried by 55.17% to 44.83%.BBC business correspondent Joe Lynam said: ""To meet a £1.5bn hole in its accounts - mostly stemming from its banking division - the Co-op Group has had to sell off parts of its businesses and hand over majority control of its bank to American hedge funds.""It's also in the process of radically changing the way it runs itself into a more corporate structure with less of a direct say by its members.""He said that ""in theory"", each of the 2.8 million Co-op members could vote on a series of motions about the reforms, as well as how its bosses are paid, and retaining the links to the Co-operative party.One of the group's largest independent societies, Midcounties, recently threatened legal action over a shortlist of six candidates for the group's board being reduced to three - the number of positions available - before a member vote.

2015-05-01,Osborne plans July 'stability' Budget,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32761566,"Chancellor George Osborne has said that he will deliver a new Budget on 8 July.He claimed it would have ""a laser-like focus"" on raising productivity and living standards.He said he was making the unusual move of having a second Budget in one year in order to ""deliver on the commitments we have made to working people"".Labour said the chancellor would have to set out ""who is going to pay"" for what it called ""uncosted promises"" in the election campaign.Speaking outside 11 Downing Street, the chancellor gave a broad outline of his plans for the forthcoming Budget but refused to be drawn on the details, including the Conservatives' planned £12bn of welfare cuts.""I don't want to wait to deliver on the commitments we have made to working people,"" he said.""It will continue with the balanced plan we have to deal with our debts, invest in our health service and reform welfare to make work pay.""But there will also be a laser-like focus on making our economy more productive so we raise living standards across our country.""We're going to put Britain into good shape for the long term.""The last Budget was held on 18 March and included tax cuts for first-time house buyers.Writing in the Sun, Mr Osborne admitted it was ""unusual"" to have two Budgets in the same year, but he wanted to turn ""promises made in the election into a reality"".Again, Mr Osborne did not specifically outline how the Conservatives plan to fulfil a pledge to cut £12bn in welfare spending but said he wants to make the welfare system ""fair for the people who pay for it"".He writes: ""We will protect the NHS and give it more funding each and every year, while making savings across Whitehall. ""We'll crack down hard on tax avoidance and aggressive tax planning by the rich - because everyone should pay their fair share.  ""We will always protect the most vulnerable, but we also need a welfare system that's fair to the people who pay for it. If you can work you should be working, so we'll take the next steps in our benefit reforms to make sure that happens.""Second, we've got to go on helping businesses create jobs in Britain, so we move towards full employment. That means facing a hard truth: in Britain we produce about a quarter less for every hour we work than countries like America or Germany. Fixing that long-running productivity weakness is the big challenge for the next five years.""So in the Budget we'll spend less on welfare, and instead invest to create three million more apprenticeships, so that young people can learn a trade, get better jobs and earn more.""After the Budget in March independent forecaster the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said that Mr Osborne needed to spell out exactly how he plans to cut £12bn from welfare spending.Of those £12bn planned cuts, £2bn were outlined ahead of the general election - all the cuts are supposed to be in place by 2017-18.Labour's shadow energy and climate change secretary, Caroline Flint, accused the Tories of making ""a number of uncosted promises"" during the election campaign.She told the BBC: ""It will be interesting to see who is going to pay for those uncosted policies when they bring the Budget in July."""
2015-05-01,Farage should take a break - Carswell,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32761766,"UKIP leader Nigel Farage ""needs to take a break now"", the party's only MP Douglas Carswell has said.Writing in the Times, Mr Carswell said he admired Mr Farage, but questioned his ""ill-advised"" comments about HIV patients, made in a TV leaders' debate.Mr Farage ruled out quitting as leader on BBC's Question Time on Thursday, saying he had ""phenomenal"" support.It follows a bitter internal row within the party, which has seen two of Mr Farage's senior aides resigning.In his article, Mr Carswell said that ""knowing how difficult it is to lead a party makes me admire Nigel Farage all the more"".""I know that I never could,"" he added, stressing that he would find it ""impossible to simultaneously lead UKIP, be the voice of the party in the Commons, represent my Clacton constituents and at the same time be a husband and a dad"".However, he said that ""even leaders need to take a break"", adding: ""Nigel needs to take a break now.""He described Mr Farage as ""inspirational"", saying the party had ""done extraordinarily well"" under his leadership but now needed to ""consider carefully what comes next"".Earlier, Mr Farage challenged his critics to decide whether they wanted him to stay in the party.He said he had ""massive"" support from UKIP MEPs, donors and party members to continue in the role, suggesting one person, whom he did not name, was ""agitating for change"".Addressing the prospect of a future EU referendum, Mr Carswell said: ""All of us UKIP supporters should ask one question; Is what I'm doing at this moment making an 'out' vote more likely? If it isn't, stop it and do something else.""He also criticised Mr Farage's comments about HIV patients during the TV leaders' debate last month.While debating about the NHS, Mr Farage said: ""You can come into Britain from anywhere in the world and get diagnosed with HIV and get the retro-viral drugs that cost up to £25,000 per year per patient.""Mr Carswell wrote: ""By all means we should highlight the problem of health tourism. But we need to admit that using the example of HIV patients to make the point was ill-advised.""He said the party needed to strike ""the right tone"" and added: ""UKIP has been at its most persuasive when we have been most optimistic.""Anger is never a great way to motivate people - at least not for very long.""The party has been beset by wrangling since Mr Farage agreed to stay on as leader, days after standing down after failing to get elected in Thanet South.He had pledged before the general election that he would quit the post if he failed to get elected to Parliament.Matthew Richardson has left the party, following claims from MEP Patrick O'Flynn that Mr Farage had fallen under the influence of ""inexperienced"" advisers.

2015-05-01,Tributes as ex-Conservative MP dies,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-northamptonshire-32764540,"Tributes have been paid to former Conservative MP Sir Peter Fry who has died at the age of 83.Sir Peter, who had been ill for a year, was MP for Wellingborough and Rushden, in Northamptonshire, for 28 years from 1969 until his defeat by Labour in 1997.In government he was notable as an expert on transport issues.Current Wellingborough Conservative MP Peter Bone said Sir Peter remained ""extremely well thought of"".""When I was canvassing in the last election, people were still talking about him. They absolutely loved how he helped them and he was a highly-regarded local MP,"" Mr Bone said.""He stood up for what was right rather than what the party line was. In those days - the John Major years - it was much more difficult to stand up against the party machine. He had strong views on Europe.""Sir Peter started his career as an insurance broker, joining the Wycombe Young Conservatives in 1949 and the Oxford University Conservative Association in 1951.He went on to become a Conservative councillor on Buckinghamshire County Council between 1961 and 1967.Wellingborough mayor-elect Barry Graves also paid tribute to Sir Peter, remembering him as a ""very strong constituency MP"".""I remember going out and canvassing with him and he would go everywhere. He knew the area and the people. He was very much a man of the local constituency.""He was ""a very approachable man"", Mr Graves added.Sir Peter was knighted in 1994. "
2015-05-01,White collar jobs call by Morgan,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-32749696,"Wales desperately needs more people in white collar jobs, and Labour needs to learn how to appeal to them, according to former First Minister Rhodri Morgan.""We've always been top-sliced as a country - the head office was somewhere else while we've always had the factory or the coal mine,"" he told BBC Wales.Higher skilled employment gave Wales more spending power, Mr Morgan added.""Wales needs that as much as those those basic jobs to replace coal and steel jobs,"" he said.The nation's industrial history had left Wales with a ""very unusual economic structure"", the former Labour first minister said, with a lack of design, engineering, science and management jobs.Responding to the Conservatives' general election victory, Mr Morgan said Labour allowed the campaign to be played like a rugby match where the pattern ""exaggerates the opposition's strengths and enables them to hide their weaknesses"".Labour was made to look as if it was only interested in issues affecting the poorest in society such as food banks and the so-called bedroom tax, he added.For more on this story, see Sunday Politics Wales on BBC One Wales at 11:00 BST on Sunday, 17 May.

2015-05-01,PM will 'look at' powers proposals,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32746049,"David Cameron has said he would ""look at"" any proposals for further powers for Scotland but wants to get the Smith Commission plans implemented first.The prime minister was speaking after meeting Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon in Edinburgh.Mr Cameron said he made a ""commitment"" to include a devolution bill in the Queen's Speech later this month.Ms Sturgeon argued the Smith Commission proposals were ""a good starting point"" but did not go far enough.The prime minister has pledged to include a bill on devolution in this month's Queen's Speech which would be based on the cross-party Smith Commission agreement. The Smith proposals included giving Holyrood the power to set income tax rates and bands, as well as control over a share of VAT and some welfare benefits. But Ms Sturgeon's SNP also wants the Scottish Parliament to be given powers over business taxes, employment law, the minimum wage and additional powers over welfare.Speaking after meeting Ms Sturgeon, Mr Cameron told the BBC: ""Let's make sure Smith is implemented in full. I'm going to keep the commitment I made to the people of Scotland. Let's get that done first because it does create a really strong Scottish Parliament.""He added: ""Of course, if people want to make future proposals I'll look at them.""The prime minister again said he did not support full fiscal autonomy for Scotland - the responsibility for all areas of tax and spending except defence and foreign affairs - stating that it would mean £7bn of cuts or extra tax-raising.What Nicola Sturgeon is trying to say is she has a mandate. She has 56 out of the 59 MPs elected in Scotland and she won 50% of the vote - unprecedented here in Scotland.She says that gives her leverage to push David Cameron. David Cameron says he wants to keep the nation together.The language coming out of Westminster last week was very much a cordial one. 'We will listen'.Nicola Sturgeon has warned him that if he doesn't listen, then the people of Scotland will judge him accordingly.Ms  Sturgeon described the hour-long talks at her official residence at Bute House as ""constructive and business-like"". She said Mr Cameron had made a ""commitment"" that the Smith proposals would be implemented ""as agreed"".""But secondly the prime minister agreed that he would look at proposals that we would now send to suggest the areas we can go beyond Smith,"" Ms Sturgeon said.""There was no agreement in terms of the substance of that but we will submit those proposals, the prime minister has said they will consider them and there will be a meeting to look at how we take that further forward.""Referring to her party's success in last week's general election, which saw the SNP win 56 out of 59 Scottish seats, Ms Sturgeon said: ""People in Scotland have now voted fairly convincingly for the SNP and sent a message that we want the Smith Commission proposals to go further and be built on.""The ball is in his court but I'm going into this in good faith.""She added: ""David Cameron and I are a world apart politically but, where we can, I'm determined to do business in the interests of the people of Scotland and across the UK.""She said she would have a ""constructive and business-like"" relationship with the prime minister. The two leaders shook hands on the front steps of Bute House as Mr Cameron arrived. Mr Cameron left the building shortly before 11:00, almost an hour after he had arrived.The two sides agreed to hold more regular discussions in the future, possibly quarterly. "
2015-05-01,Umunna withdraws Labour leader bid,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32748106,"Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna has withdrawn from the Labour party leadership contest, just days after throwing his hat into the ring.The MP, 36, said in a statement that he was not comfortable with the level of pressure and scrutiny that came with being a leadership candidate.Mr Umunna also cited concerns about the impact of the bid on his family.BBC political editor Nick Robinson said the MP's team insisted no ""unwelcome press story"" lay behind the move.But Mr Umunna had been shocked by the level of scrutiny of himself, his mother, sister and girlfriend, he said.You can follow the latest reaction here.A rising star of the party, Mr Umunna was first elected to Parliament in 2010 before joining the shadow cabinet.He confirmed his candidacy for the Labour leadership via a post on his Facebook page on 12 May, saying the party under Ed Miliband had failed to appeal to enough voters in England.But on Friday he said he had not found the leadership bid to be ""a comfortable experience"".I understand that Chuka Umunna has told friends that ""this is not right for me or people close to me. I'm human, the rest of my life is more important to me than politics.""The shadow business secretary has been distressed by the degree of scrutiny he, his family and his girlfriend have come under since he declared his intention to stand for the labour leadership.I am told that this includes reporters waiting outside the houses of relatives late at night.Friends of Mr Umunna deny that he is nervous of not getting the support of enough MPs to run for the leadership; they point out that he already has half the necessary names and that there are some weeks to go.The shadow business secretary now wants to play a leading role in arguing that Britain should stay in the EU and does not rule out seeking the leadership in the future.He said he thought he had understood ""the scrutiny and attention a leadership contest would bring"", but added: ""However, since the night of our defeat last week I have been subject to the added level of pressure that comes with being a leadership candidate.""The shadow business secretary said he had wondered if it was too soon for him to stand for the leadership, and ""I fear it was."" He also cited concerns about the impact on ""the rest of one's life"" and those close to him.""Consequently, after further reflection, I am withdrawing my candidacy,"" he said.Mr Umunna said he would continue to serve as shadow business secretary and hoped to ""play a leading role"" in Labour's campaign to keep the UK in the EU during the forthcoming in/out referendum.Commenting on the news, Labour former culture secretary Ben Bradshaw - who is expected to run for deputy leader - said Mr Umunna was a ""terrible loss"" to the field.He told the BBC's Daily Politics the Streatham MP had been the candidate the Conservative Party ""feared the most"".""And if it's the result of pressure on an extended family or an extended group of friends, I think that's a very sad reflection on our political culture,"" he said.Chuka Umunna feels ""liberated"", he told me, by his decision to quit the Labour leadership race.He hopes to be given a good role (shadow chancellor, I wonder?) by whoever becomes Labour leader. And I expect he'll become very high profile in the campaign to keep Britain in Europe, which is increasingly looking like it will be next May.He'll endorse a candidate in the next four weeks before nominations close. It will be very interesting to see who he piles in behind.Read more from Allegra (see post 13.23).Former Labour leader Lord Kinnock said he thought Mr Umunna had made the right decision.He said: ""If he felt in his soul that he wasn't prepared to subject himself - and more importantly his family - to the kind of attention which is fairly typical, sadly, these days, he has done absolutely the right thing.""There is no point at all in inflicting avoidable, unnecessary misery on those you love most.""Leadership contender Mary Creagh said she had ""huge respect"" for Mr Umunna, telling BBC Radio 4's World at One programme it took ""courage"" to withdraw from the leadership race.Mr Umunna was ""a big beast"" and would play a ""big role"" in the future of the Labour Party, she added.Yvette Cooper, Andy Burnham, Liz Kendall and Mary Creagh have already thrown their hats into the ring for Labour's top job while a number of other potential candidates, including Dan Jarvis, Alan Johnson and David Lammy, have ruled themselves out. Candidates must secure nominations from 34 colleagues - 15% of the party's MPs - by 15 June to make it on to ballot papers, which will be sent to members in August ahead of the leader's election a month later."
2015-05-01,Former MEP guilty of expenses fraud,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-32752918,"A former MEP has been convicted of fraudulently claiming almost £500,000 in European Parliament expenses.Ashley Mote, 79, denied 11 charges relating to fraudulent claims to pay people he said were ""whistleblowers"".The offences included obtaining a money transfer by deception, fraud, acquiring criminal property and false accounting.Mote, from Binsted, Hampshire, sat as an independent MEP for South East England from 2004-2009 after being expelled from UKIP for benefit fraud.He was found guilty of four counts of obtaining a money transfer by deception, three of false accounting, two of fraud, and one each of acquiring criminal property, concealing criminal property and theft.The offences took place between November 2004 and July 2010.Mote was released on conditional bail. However, Mr Justice Stuart Smith at Southwark Crown Court said there was a ""very strong likelihood"" a custodial sentence would follow.The jury heard how Mote submitted numerous false expenses claims for payment for work that organisations had allegedly carried out on his behalf.Mote claimed the money was to pay whistleblowers in cash through third parties. He also said he had been ""targeted for being an anti-EU MEP.""During his time an MEP he also made £250,000 legitimate expenses claims.No date has been set for the sentencing."

2015-05-01,Round-up: BBC experts' analysis,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/election-2015-32650417,"The political future of the United Kingdom has become clearer after the results of the general election emerged around the country.David Cameron says he hopes to govern for all of the UK after the Conservatives took 331 seats - enough to form a slender majority in the Commons.Labour has been all but wiped out by the SNP in Scotland and suffered a disappointing set of results elsewhere, while the Lib Dems are left with just eight MPs after many party heavyweights such as Vince Cable and Danny Alexander lost their seats.So with battles won and lost and the fall-out and celebrations beginning, BBC correspondents examine the implications and challenges that lie ahead for the new government - and for those whose political careers have been ended by voters.No pollster, no pundit, no political leader saw it coming - not even David Cameron himself.Governing parties don't gain seats. Parties that have implemented painful cuts and are promising more certainly don't. Until that is the Conservative Party did - achieving what had seemed to be Mission Impossible - a Tory majority.Until that is David Cameron's personal triumph which triggered the near simultaneous resignation of his three principle opponents - Messrs Miliband, Clegg and Farage.They did so in part because they helped to crush their partners in coalition these last five years - reducing the Liberal Democrat parliamentary party to a size when it can fit into two London taxis and still have two seats to spare.In part because the extraordinary tidal wave of support for the SNP swept dozens of once safe Labour seats away.In part because Nigel Farage persuaded millions to vote for him but secured just one seat - not, though, the one he was standing in.Read more from Nick Robinson hereThe question uppermost in the prime minister's mind as he assembles his new government is how to keep the kingdom united.""Above all I want to bring our country together,"" he revealed after the result, ""to reclaim a mantle we should never have lost - the mantle of one nation, one United Kingdom"".Looking at the political landscape from Land's End today is very different to the view from John O'Groats.A sea of Conservative and Unionist blue dominates the scene across much of England, while a field of SNP nationalist yellow stretches to the horizon and beyond from the north.David Cameron's greatest challenge is to prevent the union he supports being torn apart by mutual resentment - resentment from Scotland at a Westminster government dominated by English Tories, and resentment from England at the preferential treatment people think is being given to the Scots.Those who assumed the future of the Union had been safeguarded by the Scottish referendum must think again.Read more from Mark Easton hereOne thing is rock-solid true: the Conservatives who worked on this campaign are as surprised by the result as the pollsters, pundits, politicians and general population.Maybe they shouldn't be - the economy is in good shape and the Conservatives had incumbency advantage.But when I travelled back from the prime minister's last rally with a group of exhausted Conservative campaign officials it was clear that 290 seats was a hoped-for target.No-one talked about anything over 300 seats, and no-one even mentioned an overall majority.So what special sauce pushed David Cameron into No 10 with a Commons majority?Mr Cameron had two simple messages in the campaign and he rarely veered away from them; the first - the economy is in good shape and the recovery is threatened by Labour. And the second - the SNP would hold a Labour-led government to ransom.Read more from Jonny Dymond hereBrian Taylor, BBC political editor, ScotlandOf all the comments on the overnight apocalypse, undoubtedly the most straightforward came from a defeated Scottish Labour MP.Since there were quite a few of them, let me narrow the focus a little. Come on down, Tom Harris.Mr Harris had plainly anticipated defeat. Nonetheless, he looked suitably lugubrious as his fate was confirmed.Why, he was asked eagerly, had Labour lost? ""Because we did not win enough votes.""Psephologically, it is perfect. Complete in itself. Psychologically, it sums up Labour's gloom without descending into subsidiary matters such as leadership, strategy and the rest. As a forward-thinking strategy, it is ideal. Win more votes. Simple.Read more from Brian Taylor hereThis has been an election which may have more profound consequences than almost any in living memory.We now face a generational decision about our future in Europe, with an EU referendum in two years' time almost certain.There will also be serious questions about the future of the Union, following an SNP landslide that has turned Scotland into a virtual one-party state.David Cameron's victory also represents a colossal achievement.Only once before in recent history has an incumbent government increased its majority - and that was Mrs Thatcher in her prime in the 1980s.It is also a significant personal victory for Mr Cameron and a rebuff for those in his party who had become increasingly sceptical about his ability to win.But while it may represent a defeat for those Tories who saw this election as a potential opportunity to rid themselves of David Cameron, he must now govern with a wafer-thin majority.For the SNP, their stunning victory can only increase the pressure on Nicola Sturgeon to include a commitment to a second independence referendum in her party's manifesto for next year's Scottish elections.It is an election which has not just defied all the predictions of the pollsters and pundits - but which may yet prompt the most fundamental re-casting of British politics for a generation.Read more from Norman Smith hereAfter an extraordinary night, some brief conclusions:Read more from James Landale hereIs this the end of the union?That is the question many people will be asking this morning after the party which has fought for Scottish independence for 80 years swept to victory.The answer from the jubilant Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon is a firm ""No"".She insists that her MPs will speak for all of Scotland, not just for the 45% who voted for the country to leave the United Kingdom last September.In the closing hours of the most extraordinary election campaign which anyone in Scotland can remember, Ms Sturgeon turned to talk of ""legitimacy.""That will be her watchword in the coming days as she argues that the prime minister cannot ignore the democratic will of the Scottish people.Politically, Scotland and England this morning look and feel like very different countries.Read more from James Cook hereAfter weeks of chatter about an election too close to call, it wasn't that close at all.David Cameron will be continuing as our prime minister.So, what is all this likely to mean?A referendum on whether the UK stays in, or leaves, the European Union, within the next two-and-a-half years.A race to be the next leader of the Labour Party.A race to be the next leader of the Liberal Democrats.And a huge new presence of Scottish National Party MPs at Westminster.And so here's another thing we know for certain this morning: Politics ain't going to be boring any time soon.Read more from Chris Mason hereFor Labour the story of their terrible night is rapidly turning into the search for a new leader. So who will that be?Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, is almost certain to run.  Even before this election, both he and another almost inevitable candidate, Chuka Umunna, had raised eyebrows inside the party at the work they had put in, preparing the ground with members and the unions for potential bids.Yvette Cooper, before the election, was still thought not to have made up her mind over whether to run. That decision has been made perhaps a little easier as her husband, Ed Balls, has lost his seat.She is certainly potentially in the frame, along with two lesser known names - Liz Kendall and Dan Jarvis - two MPs who were only elected in 2010 for the first time. This could be their moment. But whoever is in the job, they face a monumental task.Read Laura Kuenssberg's Twitter hereSterling is up (the most for seven years against the euro), share prices are up (especially bank shares like Lloyds and RBS, and energy shares such as Centrica), government bond prices are up.To state the obvious, investors love the Tories' general election victory.There are a few reasons.One (no surprise here) is that Labour's threat of breaking up banks and imposing energy price caps has been lifted.Second is that investors have been discounting days and weeks of wrangling after polling day over who would form the government - and so they are semi-euphoric that we already know who's in charge.Third, many investors tend to be economically conservative and instinctively Conservative.But although the City may be a bit drunk on the result, its pleasure in Ed Miliband's and Ed Balls' humiliation may be making it a bit blind - perhaps dangerously so - to some bumps in the economic road ahead.Read more from Robert Peston hereNigel Farage dreamed of holding the balance of power, but in the end his UKIP party is now worse off than when it came into the election.At the seventh time of asking he was rejected - this time by the people of Thanet South. It was a similar story in Rochester and Strood where Mark Reckless, who sensationally defected from the Tories last year, was also sent packing.In seats on UKIP's target list, like Thurrock in Essex, the party failed to make gains. In Grimsby - where Mr Farage went twice in the last six weeks - they came third.UKIP got around four million votes - with especially strong showings in north-east and south-east England - but it's ended up with just one MP, and a vacancy at the top. This has led to UKIP attacking the current system of choosing MPs, which it's described as ""busted"" and ""dysfunctional"".In one sense, this campaign was a complete failure and it's left an aftermath of angry voters, and others wondering if the UKIP bubble has burst.Read Robin Brant's Twitter hereI monitored 91 GB-wide voting intention polls during the 2015 election campaign and found nothing in them to prepare me for the final outcome.The good news for the pollsters was that their share for the Lib Dems was pretty close, as were the shares for UKIP, the Greens and the catch-all category of Others.The bad news for the polling industry was that the crucial shares for Conservative and Labour were the ones where they came most adrift.When all the qualifications of margins of error are allowed, there did appear to be a systematic overstatement of the Labour share and an equally systematic understatement of the Conservative one.It is for the pollsters to decide whether to conduct a review of their performance but I trust they will avoid the initial knee-jerk reaction of the immediate aftermath of the 1992 polls debacle.This general election performance follows the performance of the polls in the 2014 Scottish referendum where the choice was simply binary and yet all the polls were out by between 4-6%.Something is wrong. A lot of us would like to know what it is.Read more from David Cowling hereThe words ""political earthquake"" have been translated into numerous European languages, making front page news across the continent.While Britons now examine the domestic minutiae of the election result, here in mainland Europe the vote means one thing: a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU. And that has the potential to create an earthquake of its own.The guardian of the EU treaties Mr Cameron wants to change - Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker - has said again he'd listen to what Britain's new government proposed.Read more from Katya Adler here"

He's not the only party leader to face an attempted ousting. But can you recover from such a revolt?In 2006, the Labour prime minister was the target of what became known as the ""curry house conspiracy"" - a coup to remove him and install his chancellor, Gordon Brown, as prime minister.It would lead to several of the plotters' resignations - but not Mr Blair's. However, it was successful to a degree in that it forced the party leader into naming a departure date.The move against him was reportedly masterminded by Tom Watson, a defence minister at the time, who was also rumoured to have had a secret meeting with Mr Brown on the eve of the revolt.Apparently, Mr Watson and three fellow West Midlands MPs - Sion Simon, David Wright (both ministerial aides) and Khalid Mahmood - met over a biryani at a Wolverhampton curry house to discuss the PM's future, before dispatching a missive calling for him to quit.The letter - which attracted the support of a number of normally loyal Labour MPs - was leaked to the press, and ultimately resulted in Mr Watson's resignation.In his parting letter, the West Bromwich East MP took a shot at the prime minister, who he said should step down in the interests of party and country.Mr Blair denounced his actions and branded the former minister ""disloyal, discourteous and wrong"", saying he would have sacked him if he had not resigned.But Mr Watson's departure was swiftly followed by the resignations of six other junior members of government - who had also signed the rebel letter - in protest at the prime minister's refusal to say when he would step down as Labour leader.The whole affair resulted in Mr Blair announcing his intention to step aside within 12 months - which he duly did, on 27 June 2007.But it did nothing to quash internal dissent and speculation in the party over the future leadership of the party.Labour prime minister Gordon Brown found his leadership under threat in 2009 after one of his cabinet ministers dramatically quit the government and called for him to resign.Work and Pensions Secretary James Purnell - a former aide to Tony Blair - resigned from his post after the polls closed in the local and European elections, in which Labour was forecast to do badly.Explaining his decision to quit, Mr Purnell said the prime minister made a Conservative victory ""more, not less, likely"".It was Mr Brown's first direct challenge from a cabinet minister - but it would not topple the Labour leader as senior members of government refused to follow Mr Purnell's lead.Mr Brown was safe for the time being. But several months later, in January 2010, a fresh leadership challenge was mounted by two senior former Labour cabinet ministers.Geoff Hoon and Patricia Hewitt wrote to all Labour MPs, saying the party was ""deeply divided"" over Mr Brown's leadership and that the best way to resolve the issue was by way of secret ballot.They insisted it was not an ""attempted coup"" but a necessary step to resolve divisions within the party.But the duo could only muster the public support of a handful of backbenchers long-opposed to Mr Brown, with the majority of the party's MPs less than impressed by the move, which came just weeks before the general election.As the day wore on, a succession of cabinet ministers came out to back the PM, suggesting there was little momentum behind the plot - although it was noted that several were not exactly gushing in their support of Mr Brown.As history tells us, neither leadership challenge bore fruit but they reflected the internal doubts and divisions over Mr Brown at the helm.As leadership toppling attempts go, this one in 2014 was regarded as a particularly ""botched"" and ""shambolic coup"". Indeed, former Lib Dem leader Lord (Paddy) Ashdown described the move as a ""plot of deep malice"".Its instigator, Lord (Matthew) Oakeshott - a close ally of the-then Business Secretary Vince Cable - tried to unseat Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg.The peer was found to have commissioned secret polls suggesting the party would do better at the 2015 general election without Mr Clegg in the driving seat.The man Lord Oakeshott had long had in mind to take Mr Clegg's place - Mr Cable, who was on government business in China at the time - was forced to publicly condemn his friend's actions and state his backing for Mr Clegg.But Lord Oakeshott said the business secretary had in fact known about his polls and their findings.Nevertheless, the peer - who was denounced by the Lib Dem leadership for spending money that could have been spent on campaigning - quit the party, and issued a warning shot on his way out about the Lib Dems' future prospects.Mr Cable largely emerged unscathed but he faced questions about his loyalty to the leader. Although the two sought to put paid to reports of a rift with a (painfully awkward, 'nothing to see here, folks') stage-managed pint in a pub.Although the revolt failed, and Mr Clegg remained at the helm, the Lib Dems did go on to suffer a trouncing at the general election, losing nearly 50 of its MPs - one of them, Mr Cable himself - prompting his leader to quit.The Conservatives have a reputation for being more ruthless than their party rivals when it comes to getting rid of leaders they sense are no longer effectual.But, in 1995, Prime Minister John Major - tired of persistent rumours of a leadership challenge - decided to take the bull by the horns and trigger a surprise leadership election to silence his detractors.His own backbenchers had questioned Mr Major's ability to unite and lead the party, which was deeply divided over Europe.So ""put up or shut up"", he told them as he tendered his resignation as Conservative Party leader but not prime minister.But then stepped forward eurosceptic MP John Redwood, who resigned from the cabinet in order to contest Mr Major's leadership.This was unexpected by many, as the PM had said there had been assurances from his cabinet that none would stand against him.But Mr Major went on to win the ensuing election with a comfortable defeat over his challenger, who was not included in the PM's consequent cabinet reshuffle.No further contested leadership election took place until after the Conservatives' defeat at the 1997 general election, paving the way for William Hague to take over the running of the party.Not all attempts to oust a party leader end in failure: as Margaret Thatcher found out to her peril.With three electoral victories under her belt, the Conservative prime minister's downfall would come at the hands of her own party - not the voters.It was on 1 November 1990 when Geoffrey (now Lord) Howe - one of Mrs Thatcher's longest-serving ministers - resigned over differences with the party leader over Europe.In his now infamous speech on the floor of the House of Commons, he attacked the PM's policies and leadership style, comparing being one of her cabinet ministers to opening the batting at cricket only to find his bat had been ""broken... by the team captain"".It sparked the beginning of the end of the 11-year Thatcher reign.Michael (now Lord) Heseltine seized on the opportunity to challenge the prime minister in the ensuing leadership contest, from which she would eventually withdraw and John Major emerge as her successor. Reflecting on the revolt and its implications on the Conservative Party, Baroness Thatcher's biographer Charles Moore wrote: ""Because the coup was unjustified, and so trust broke down, the politics of the next 15 years were those of civil war."""
2015-05-01,Election swings and roundabouts,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-32741924,"If election manifesto claims are all about smoke and mirrors, should we now add swings and roundabouts to the political metaphor?There's an intriguing aspect to the general election results in the Midlands that puzzled me.It's the striking contrast in the swings between Labour and the Conservatives.David Cameron and his campaign strategists knew they were home and dry when Nuneaton was the first Midlands marginal to declare.It was not only a Tory hold but a swing to the Conservatives from Labour of 3%.I was in the Nottingham suburb of Beeston awaiting the result of the Broxtowe count. Would its high profile Conservative MP Anna Soubry survive a red surge?Nuneaton set the pattern. Across the Midlands, both east and west, there was a uniform swing of between three and four per cent to the Tories - Warwickshire North 3%, Amber Valley 4%, Derbyshire South 4% and Sherwood 4%. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan topped the Tory swingometer in the Midlands marginals with 5% in Loughborough.Yet in the big cities, it was a very different story. The swing went to Labour.So in Nottingham East they enjoyed a 6% swing, Nottingham South 5.8%, Leicester South 7.3%, Leicester West 5%, Birmingham Hall Green 12%, Birmingham Hodge Hill 8%.If swings to Labour on this scale had gone beyond the city ring road roundabouts and into the suburbs, Ed Miliband would have become prime minister by now.In confidence, one senior Labour insider in Nottingham told me its success in the city wards was down to organisation, experience and its teams of activists.""We won the ground war. If Nottingham's city boundaries were extended into Sherwood and Broxtowe, we would have won those constituencies as well,"" he told me.Labour leadership candidate, Leicester West's Liz Kendall has identified her party's problem beyond the ring road roundabout.It's about reaching out to Middle England.""We need to show people that we understand their aspirations and ambitions for the future,"" she told the Sunday Times.The problem for Labour was that Middle England was not interested in what the party offered…and still isn't. The Cameron brand worked its magic in those Midlands marginals... it'll take something or someone special to break up that ballot box relationship."
2015-05-01,Royal 'lobbying',https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32740154,"Prince Charles sent 27 letters to then Prime Minister Tony Blair and members of his government between September 2004 and March 2005, ""despite the Freedom of Information Act!"" as the prince joked in one.But did his suggestions and concerns have any bearing on the behaviour of Mr Blair's government?The request: Prince Charles expresses his worries over an EU directive on complementary medicines ""which is… effectively outlawing the use of certain herbal extracts"".  Mr Blair replied, offering moral support and practical help. He agreed that ""the implementation as it is currently planned is crazy"" and set out an action plan that included delaying implementation for all existing products to 2011. What happened: Herbal products were not required to be authorised until 2011, just as Mr Blair had promised. Prince Charles continues to sell his own brand of complementary products, Duchy Herbals, through Boots and Waitrose. The request: Writing to Mr Blair, the prince expresses a ""growing sense of anxiety"" that the Hill Farming Allowance, which supports farmers working on Britain's uplands, could be scrapped. In his reply, the prime minister said he understood that the Hill Farm Allowance would continue until 2007. What happened: The allowance lasted until the end of Labour's tenure in 2010, when it was abolished.The request: Just 18 months after the US-led invasion of Iraq, Prince Charles raised the issue of poor performance of Lynx helicopters in high temperatures, saying: ""I fear that this is just one more example of where our Armed Forces are being asked to do an extremely challenging job (particularly in Iraq) without the necessary resources.""Mr Blair replied: ""On the subject of the Lynx helicopter, the limitations of the existing platform, particularly in the extremely challenging environment within Iraq, are well recognised by the Ministry of Defence."" He added that replacement of the helicopters would be a priority. What happened: Mr Blair's comments go much further than what he was saying about the subject at the time. In the event, though, the fleet was not fully upgraded until 2011.The request: Prince Charles lamented that the government's TB prevention plans might not ""include a commitment to deal with the badger problem in the immediate future"" and pushed strongly for a cull, saying: ""All I can say is that I do urge you to look again at introducing a proper cull of badgers where it is necessary.""Mr Blair sympathised, saying he could ""personally see the case for culling badgers"". However, he was unwilling to commit to a cull.  What happened: Culling trials were conducted from 1998-2005. The final results, published in 2008, said that the badger cull could ""make no meaningful contribution"" to curbing bovine TB. It wasn't until 2013 that a full culling programme began in two pilot areas. These ended with the conclusion that the pilots had been neither humane nor effective at curbing the spread of TB.The request: Then Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell wrote to Prince Charles to say she had decided to give parts of the historic Smithfield meat market Grade II listed status, and was trying to persuade deputy prime minister John Prescott to ""call in"" the planning application to prevent demolition of other parts of the site. She had been swayed by evidence provided by Sir Neil Cossons, who was English Heritage chair at the time, after he had been asked by the prince to add his support. Prince Charles replied that he was ""extremely glad to read of your appreciation of the value of this group of buildings"". According to the Guardian, market workers desperate to see the redevelopment of the site invited the prince to meet them to discuss it, but his office said he was ""unlikely to accept as he did not want to interfere in the planning process"".What happened: Smithfield market is still the subject of planning battles a decade on. Successive planning applications have been refused by ministers. Last year then Communities Secretary Eric Pickles rejected plans for an office development on the site, stating that ""the extent of damage that the application would cause to the important heritage assets at Smithfield runs entirely counter to national and policy objectives intended to protect such assets from harm"".In March, the Museum of London announced a move from its current Barbican site to the Smithfield market building."
2015-05-01,Election fallout,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32703139,"""Some of those gimmicks - that tombstone, whatever idiot thought that up I do not know!""I was talking to the former Mayor of Crawley in Sussex, John Mortimer, in the town's Labour Supporters Club about the vexed question of what went wrong, and where Labour should go next. This seat is one of those southern seats Labour hoped to take, but failed.I hear a whole range of views in the club.""They didn't give nothing to depend on, they should be clear, and a little bit more down to Earth."" ""Good party, wrong leader, they don't look after business enough.""Councillor John Stanley tells me: ""I think in a way we did go too left, but now we can go a bit centre-left, or centre, depending who the new leader is.""The former mayor sums up the mood on the doorstep: ""Whatever we told them, they didn't believe us.""  Expect to hear all those views, and more, in the coming leadership contest. Step back from the angst of supporters, and it may not be that hard to see why Labour failed.  An economic recovery, hailed by independent organisations as the result of government policy, undid a party that had loudly proclaimed for five years that the coalition's policies would lead to economic disaster. Combine that with an uncharismatic and uninspirational leader, then you might argue no further debate is necessary.Fat chance of that. Defeat breeds resentment, and this one has opened up old divisions.  A chorus of Blairties, led by the man himself, has declared that Ed's problem was ignoring those with aspiration and ambition, failing to appeal to those running business. Incidentally, I've been ticked off by the perspicacious editor of the New Statesman, Jason Cowley, for using the ""unhelpful"" term ""Blairites"".I can't think of another description that fits Tony, Lord Mandelson, Lord Adonis and David Miliband quite so well. But call them what you will, the message was clear - Ed was too left wing, Labour should move back to the centre, or, if you like, to the right.Reading Mr Blair's pithy analysis, listening to Lord Mandelson's gripping and savage eloquence, describing a party sent out to shout: ""We love the poor and hate the rich,"" and so ignoring the middle, and you realise strong emotions are in play.But back to the future may not be sufficient. Of course elections are won on the centre ground. But grandees grinding axes, affronted by the failure of boys who used to make their tea, may be creating so much noise that they can't hear more insistent sounds.  For there are several elephants trumpeting loudly as they cram into the small space of the shadow cabinet room. Imagine these beasts are as gaily decorated as Berlin buddy bears. One is decked out in red, another in imperial purple bunting, and another, a mammoth, strong tusked and ice rimmed, painted yellow with tartan trimmings.Take the last first. The Scottish wipeout is Labour's biggest problem. Fail to solve it, and Labour can forget ever having a comfortable majority again. It is hard to argue Labour were wiped out in Scotland because the SNP outflanked them to the right with their appeal to the business community and the ambitious and aspirational. But it is true the SNP drew in to people from left, right and centre, just as the modernisers say Labour should. It was the politics of economic self-interest, but cast in a very different light. Tribally sneering at ""the reactionary ideology of nationalism"" as Mr Blair does, will not reach the central belt of Scotland, the middle ground of  Midlothian.What about that purple pachyderm?  In Crawley - in fact in seat after seat - there is a similar pattern.  Labour did, in fact, often increase the size of their vote. So did the Conservatives, usually by a bit more. But the real dynamic was the total collapse of the Lib Dems and the dramatic rise of UKIP. The increase in votes for Nigel Farage's party wasn't translated into parliamentary seats, but, although it is early days in terms of research, it probably hurt Labour a lot. If we believe - and I do - Matthew Goodwin and Rob Ford, authors of Revolt on the Right, these voters are often former Labour supporters - older, less educated, those left behind on the tides of  globalisation, stranded on the shores of post-industrialisation. They may have had too many disappointments to feel much ambition or aspiration. They are a challenge for Labour, and any new leader will spend a good deal of time thinking how to deal with the concerns of Europe and immigration.Whether to share their fears, or confront them will be a big decision.Which brings us to Red Nellie. Those members who still proudly call themselves socialist. This is not about Old Labour - they are more likely to be baristas or barristers than boilermakers. It is easy as an outsider, as a journalist, to treat politics as an intellectual game about how best to win power - but many people, particularly the foot soldiers, particularly after the death of  purely tribal loyalties, are in it because they passionately believe in winning  power to do something specific.Many of them are suspicious of the later incarnations of New Labour, not because it reached an accommodation with wealth and business, but because it seemed to worship at the same altar, to regard the party's core beliefs in redistribution and equality as childish fantasies from a past age.Perhaps to Mr Blair, they are the problem, people who may equate ""ambition"" with greed. They might point out that a man who claims to be worth ""only"" £20m may find it harder than most to squeeze through the eye of a needle to understand their point of view. Most successful Labour leaders will confront the left at some point, but the concerns of this group go to the existential question ""What is the party for?""This is not a polemic - not an argument about what should be done, but a reflection on the complex conundrums that will face any new Labour leader, the tearing apart of the old alliance that made up a Labour majority, and so the political need to satisfy groups with very different, indeed, contradictory demands. But looking for a Social Democratic universal theory of everything may be missing the point. What the party desperately wants is a leader who can pull the disparate threads together and articulate them as common purpose. Whether she or he exists is another matter.Much more on that in the coming months."
2015-05-01,'Take us with you',https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-32736153,"Thousands of people in the north of England have been using the hashtag ""take us with you Scotland"" to express their upset about the result of last week's general election, and Scottish nationalists are welcoming this English minority with open arms. Last Thursday's general election was a rough one for the Labour Party in its traditional stronghold in the north of England. But further to the north, the left-leaning Scottish National Party won nearly every seat it contested. That political contrast has made some left-wing voters in places like Manchester, Leeds and Sheffield look fondly on their neighbours. Since last Thursday's election in Britain the phrase ""take us with you Scotland"" has been used more than 24,000 times. ""Genuinely beginning to wonder if the North of England becoming a part of Scotland would be better for us, I really am,"" tweeted Aaron Miller from Yorkshire. Some cracked jokes under the tag after the North West Motorway Police account, which gives traffic updates, announced that they had ""picked up a pedestrian on the M62 who was trying to walk to Scotland.""After an initial spike of jokes over the weekend, the hashtag really took off when users start to mobilise in support of around a year-old petition on the campaigning site Change.org. The petition calls for the north of England to secede from the rest of the country and join up with Scotland, and more than 12,000 people have signed it.Its creator, a Sheffield resident who calls himself ""Stu Dent"", set it up to coincide with last year's Scottish independence referendum, and he also created a map imagining the boundary of a ""Scotland plus the north"" country.Stu Dent runs the Twitter account Hunters Bar, named after an area of southwest Sheffield which is very popular with - you guessed it - students. Despite the account having thousands of followers on Twitter, when the map was first posted last year, the image was shared only about 100 times - however, in the past week it's been retweeted by thousands. Stu Dent told BBC Trending that he was surprised at how popular his idea has become. ""In hindsight, perhaps I shouldn't have been,"" he said. ""There is a huge frustration in parts of the UK about the things that have happened since 2010.""""I think people need a place to go where they can say 'not in my name! This is not the England I want',"" he added. But in addition to disappointment from some quarters about the election result, there might be another reason why the petition is getting a boost now: the power of the Scottish Nationalists on Twitter. What started as a post-election joke in the North of England was quickly embraced by the so-called ""Cyber Nats"" - and a trend was born.The SNP's social media strategist Ross Colquhoun expressed the party's mood about the hashtag best, in a post which was shared more than 500 times. ""2014: #LetsStayTogether 2015: #TakeUsWithYouScotland What a difference a year makes"" he tweeted.Blog by Hannah HendersonNext story: The sport reporter and the obscene ranter who lost his jobFollow BBC Trending on Twitter @BBCtrending, and find us on Facebook."
2015-05-01,What Britain wants from Europe,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32695399,"David Cameron says he has a mandate to pursue EU reform following the Conservatives' general election victory. The PM, who will be hoping his majority government will give him extra leverage in Brussels, wants to renegotiate the terms of the UK's membership ahead of a referendum by the end of 2017. He has said he will campaign for Britain to remain in the EU if he gets the reforms he wants.Mr Cameron has said he does not want to reveal full details of his negotiating hand but he has given a broad indication, in a series of speeches and newspaper articles, of his priorities when he goes into talks with other EU leaders.These are: The prime minister has said Britain would resist any move towards a European Army and that he wants to free British police forces from EU interference. He has also ruled out Britain joining the euro.But he has placed less emphasis in recent years on demanding changes to EU social policy, such as the maximum 48-hour working week, agency workers, maternity leave and non-discrimination rules.The official UK government position is that a referendum will be held by the end of 2017 but Downing Street sources have said: ""If we can do it earlier we will.""There is speculation David Cameron is planning to hold the vote in 2016 to avoid a clash with French and German elections in 2017.The prime minister wants treaty change but even if the referendum was held in 2017 there may not be enough time to legally incorporate any reforms into a treaty and it would have to be done at a later stage.An early referendum would anger Eurosceptics who believe it would not allow enough time to make the case for exit or negotiate any meaningful concessions.""A rushed process would severely undermine the chances to secure a significant deal that both British business and voters could support and would waste the opportunity of a lifetime,"" Matthew Elliott, chief executive of Business for Britain told Breitbart London.The question is always crucial in any referendum and there is already a debate about what it should be. The Draft European Union (Referendum) Bill, published by the Conservatives in 2013, proposed this form of words: ""Do you think that the United Kingdom should remain a member of the European Union?""Some thought that leaned too far towards the status quo, encouraging a yes vote, and the Electoral Commission said it was not clear and direct enough. The watchdog proposed this form of words instead: ""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union?""The new Conservative government will attempt to repeal the Human Rights Act, which requires UK courts to treat the European Court of Human Rights as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. The European Court of Human Rights is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe (CoE), which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine.The freedom for people to move around Europe, enshrined in the EU treaties, works in parallel with the other three basic freedoms in the single market: freedom of goods, capital and services.It is likely to be a ""red line"" for other EU leaders, who do not want to see it eroded.Mr Cameron has steered clear of tackling it directly - for example by asking for an emergency ""brake"" on free movement, or a cap on numbers - focusing instead on reducing the incentive provided by welfare payments. In a speech last November, David Cameron set out measures to reduce the number of EU nationals moving to the UK.His main proposals were:Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission, has said he is ready to work with Mr Cameron to ""strike a fair deal for the United Kingdom in the EU"". The leaders of other EU nations have previously warned they are unlikely to support major changes to EU treaties to accommodate British demands. But Mr Cameron's general election victory may have given him extra leverage. ""The ball is very much in the court of the UK now,"" a senior EU official told The Guardian. ""It's up to the British to define what they want."" The key figure will be German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is very keen to keep Britain in the EU but has so far been unwilling to make major concessions to enable that to happen. There are fears that a ""pick and mix"" approach to EU treaties would undermine EU cohesion.Mr Cameron has said there is ""no doubt"" his planned reforms will require changes to the treaties governing the European Union. But this would require the unanimous support of all EU members, and may not be possible within the deadline he has set of a referendum before the end of 2017. Any attempt to change EU laws on free movement would meet fierce resistance from some EU nations, particularly Eastern European states. Mr Juncker has said free movement is non-negotiable.Mr Cameron may find it difficult to get unanimous support for his proposals for a four-year waiting period for migrant workers claiming UK benefits. East European EU members would be likely to oppose this, on the grounds that it would discriminate against their citizens.  Attempts to secure opt-outs for the City are unlikely to go down well with other European leaders.However, there are precedents for EU treaty changes to accommodate some countries' specific concerns - for example, the protocol attached to the Lisbon Treaty for Ireland.Mr Cameron has faced repeated calls to say whether he would campaign for Britain's exit from the EU in the referendum if he fails to get what he wants from the renegotiation process. All he has said is that he will ""rule nothing out"". Some Conservative MPs want Britain to leave the EU no matter what David Cameron manages to renegotiate. A larger group are likely to want more concessions than Mr Cameron has so far indicated he is prepared to demand.Senior backbencher David Davis, who was defeated by Mr Cameron for the Tory leadership in 2005, told the Daily Telegraph the majority of the 332 Conservative MPs want Mr Cameron to negotiate an ""opt-out"" power to stop individual EU laws from applying to Britain. The prime minister has said this would be ""impossible"" without Britain leaving the EU.Mr Davis claims as many as 60 Tory MPs would be prepared to rebel and vote for Britain's exit from the EU if the prime minister fails to deliver.Graham Brady, chairman of the Tory backbench 1922 committee, which represents backbenchers, has urged David Cameron to give all Conservative MPs, including ministers, a free vote in the EU referendum.In January, Mr Cameron warned that serving cabinet ministers would have to quit the government if they wanted to campaign to leave the EU if he had secured the reforms to it he wants.In the 1975 referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Economic Community, as the EU was then called, Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson decided to suspend collective responsibility because his cabinet was split on the issue. Ministers were allowed to vote with their consciences and campaign against each other. The majority of them, including Mr Wilson, joined the Yes camp, but left-wingers, such as Tony Benn, played a leading role in the No campaign. The Yes campaign won easily with 67% of the vote."

2015-05-02,Scots Labour leader Murphy to resign,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32760196,"Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy is to resign next month, he has announced.It comes despite Mr Murphy narrowly surviving a vote of no confidence at a meeting of the party's national executive in Glasgow. Mr Murphy said he would tender his resignation alongside a plan to reform the party.He lost his seat in last week's general election as the SNP won 56 of the 59 Scottish seats, leaving Labour with a single MP in Scotland.Mr Murphy said he wanted to have a successor as leader in place by the summer, and confirmed he would not be standing for a seat at the Scottish Parliament in next year's election. Instead, he said it was time to ""do something else"" and that he believed the party would continue to be divided if he remained as leader. His deputy, Kezia Dugdale MSP, will become acting leader until a permanent successor is found. Mr Murphy had faced calls to resign from several MSPs, trade unions and former MPs in the wake of his party's near wipeout at the general election.He insisted he had decided to stand down ahead of the national executive voting by 17-14 in favour of him staying in the job.Speaking at a media conference after the national executive meeting, he said: ""It is clear that a small minority who didn't accept my election as leader of the Scottish Labour Party just five months ago won't accept the vote of the executive today and that will continue to divide the party.""Today I received more support in the executive vote than I did from members of the executive when I stood for election five months ago.""He said it would be up to the executive whether to accept the reforms he would be proposing before he left the post. But he warned: ""A party in such urgent need of reform blocks those changes at its peril.""The former East Renfrewshire MP said Labour had been crushed between ""two nationalisms"" in Scotland and England.Mr Murphy said he left no legacy of bitterness for anyone in the Labour Party, and the only person he was angry at was the person who blamed Scottish Labour for the party's UK-wide general election defeat - a reference to Unite leader Len McCluskey.And he said that in many ways Scottish Labour was the ""least modernised part of the Labour movement"" and that he wanted his successor to be elected under a one member, one vote system.Mr Murphy added: ""The Labour Party's problem is not the link with trade unions, or even the relationship with Unite members - far from it. It is the destructive behaviour of one high profile trade unionist.""The leader of the Scottish Labour Party doesn't serve at the grace of Len McCluskey, and the next leader of the UK Labour Party should not be picked by Len McCluskey.""Mr McCluskey has been a vocal critic of Mr Murphy's leadership and opposed his appointment in December when Mr Murphy won the contest to replace Johann Lamont.Jim Murphy laughed and joked with Scottish Labour's sole MP as he made his way down the hotel corridor to announce his resignation.He certainly brought energy and dynamism to his election campaign - but all that achieved was Ian Murray in Edinburgh South.So as Mr Murphy bows out, who could replace him?The deputy leader Kezia Dugdale may want to step up or Neil Findlay could try again after challenging last time. Maybe the party's finance spokeswoman Jackie Baillie thinks her steady hand could steer the ship.Jenny Marra is also often talked about as future face of the party.Whoever steps into Jim Murphy's red shoes he or she will have to face a difficult 2016 Holyrood election, to put it mildly.There are also more fundamental questions about how the party can possibly move on as it faces a surging SNP.Mr Murphy was very much a creature of ""New Labour"" - but to today's generation that's old Labour.Party members may start looking for someone with no links to the past, neither a Brownite nor a Blairite. A 'cleanskin' - as the politicos put it - may well help re-connect with voters.That's a long way from now though - even some of the party's opponents may view this latest train wreck with a modicum of sympathy. Ms Lamont had resigned after claiming Scottish Labour was treated like a ""branch office"" by the London-based party leadership.Mr Murphy concluded his speech by saying: ""Scotland needs a strong Labour party; Scotland needs a united Labour party. We have been the greatest force for change in our nation's remarkable history. ""The Scottish Labour party will rise again. It will be under someone else's leadership and I am confident about my party's future.""Harriet Harman MP, acting leader of the UK Labour Party, said it would be for Scottish Labour to choose a new leader. She added: ""As a cabinet minister and leader of his party in Scotland, Jim has been a hugely important figure in the Labour Party. He leaves with the best wishes and thanks of our movement.""Labour peer Lord McConnell, a former Scottish first minister, said the party's problems were ""much deeper than one individual and one affiliate"".He said: ""We have a disconnect locally and nationally with wider Scottish society. ""We have a problem with our political positioning in the post devolution age where the party particularly at the UK level has never been comfortable with success in the Scottish parliament and has always tried to see things through a UK prism rather than a Scottish prism.""We need to find a new generation, a new leader, new generation, new ideas, a fresh approach.""In a tweet, Scottish first minister and SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said: ""I wish Jim Murphy all the very best for the future. Leadership is not easy and he deserves credit for standing up for what he believes in.""Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson also reacted on Twitter, saying: ""Jim Murphy announces a managed exit in order to help the party, which is to his credit. But leaves a tough gig for whoever comes next.""The meeting of Scottish Labour's executive was disrupted by protesters who entered the party's headquarters.Police were called and the protesters, who included persistent anti-austerity activists Sean Clerkin and Piers Doughty-Brown, left the building to protest further from the street outside.The protesters were calling for Mr Murphy to remain as leader to ""finish the job of destroying Scottish Labour"".A Police Scotland spokeswoman said officers had been called and found two protestors on the third floor of the building. She added: ""Both left on police arrival. Advice and assistance was given."""
2015-05-02,Labour contenders clash on spending,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32761561,"Prospective Labour leaders have clashed over Labour's record in government in their first public debate in the race to succeed Ed Miliband.Former cabinet ministers including Yvette Cooper and Andy Burnham defended Labour's fiscal record and spending on schools and hospitals.However, candidates from the 2010 intake of MPs argued that the party spent too much while in office.The debate followed Chuka Umunna's withdrawal from the leadership contest.The remaining candidates appeared at the annual conference of the Progress think tank in London.There was agreement that Labour needed to demonstrate economic credibility to regain power, with shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt telling the meeting that the party needed to be ""trusted with public finances and the family finances"".Mr Hunt, who was first elected to Parliament in 2010 when Labour lost power, argued the last Labour government ""spent too much"" and failed to ""leave enough economic headroom to deal with the economic crisis and the recession"".Shadow health minister Liz Kendall said: ""There's absolutely nothing progressive about spending more on debt interest payments than on educating our children.""But shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: ""The Tories have had a triumph of spin over the facts in saying what they said about the economic record of the last Labour government.""The former chief secretary to the Treasury said the deficit did ""grow too large"" in the government's later years but insisted: ""The last Labour government ran more surpluses in its first term than the Tories did in 18 years.""Yvette Cooper, another former chief secretary to the Treasury, said: ""We should never let anybody tell us that it was too many teachers, doctors or nurses that caused Lehman Brothers bank in New York to crash.""Shadow international development secretary Mary Creagh said: ""People have forgotten the economic credibility that the last Labour government had.""She said Labour had built schools and hospitals that were ""treasured in our communities"".Ms Cooper, Mr Burnham, Ms Kendall and Ms Creagh have declared their intention to run for leader, while Mr Hunt told the conference he would make an announcement next week.At the same event, shadow energy secretary Caroline Flint announced she would be running for deputy leader.The Don Valley MP told the Today programme ahead of the debate that Labour lost the election because ""fundamentally the public did not trust us on the economy"".Exeter MP Ben Bradshaw has already announced a bid to be deputy, saying Labour ""must and could win the next election"", but only if it ""broadens its appeal by adopting sensible, centre-left politics which celebrate wealth creation and entrepreneurship"".Former Labour campaign co-ordinator Tom Watson is reported to be crowd-funding a deputy leadership bid, while Walthamstow MP Stella Creasy has said she is ""open to the question"" of running.Barnsley East MP and shadow transport secretary Michael Dugher - a fierce critic of Ed Miliband's election campaign - is to run Mr Burnham's campaign, according to the website LabourList.It is reported that Mr Burnham also has the backing of Labour peer Lord Falconer, who was lord chancellor and justice secretary under Tony Blair and was close to the former PM.Shadow culture secretary Chris Bryant has signalled his backing for Ms Cooper, tweeting that the next leader must be ""someone who's been tried in the fiery furnace of public opinion"".Mr Hunt said on Friday he would be be attending the debate - along with the other four hopefuls - to ""set out my analysis on how we begin to understand what went so wrong and why"".He added: ""We must use this leadership election to ask some very profound questions.""All voices in the party must be heard so that we can have a full and proper assessment as to why the politics of nationalism triumphed in Scotland and huge swathes of England, and how we have allowed the Conservative Party to present a more compelling vision for Britain to so many millions of people.""Speculation still surrounds shadow business secretary Mr Umunna's decision to pull out on Friday, when he said he was not ""comfortable"" with the ""pressure"" of being a candidate.As well as citing extensive pressure and scrutiny Mr Umunna also said he was ruling himself out because of concerns about the impact of the bid on his family.A rising star of the party, Mr Umunna was first elected to Parliament in 2010 - alongside Tristram Hunt and Liz Kendall - before joining the shadow cabinet.Asked about the candidate who might win, Conservative Chancellor George Osborne said: ""The Labour leadership contest has descended into farce.""But it's not actually about personalities. I don't think the Labour Party any more represents the working people of this country who aspire to a better life."""

I'm not suggesting he takes a break from being leader.""Clearly the national executive has the authority, they're the ruling body. ""I'm told that they made a decision. I'm told it was a procedurally correct decision, he is the leader but I think it's important that as leader he takes a break and I think it's important that we work out how these complex questions are answered by a team.""No one person has all the answers. I'm particularly concerned about tone, making sure we get a tone that ensures that the 27 million people who didn't vote for UKIP last week may be persuaded to vote for us in future.""The party has been beset by wrangling since Mr Farage agreed to stay on as leader, days after standing down after failing to get elected in Thanet South.He had pledged before the general election that he would quit the post if he failed to get elected to Parliament.Senior aide Matthew Richardson has left the party, following claims from MEP Patrick O'Flynn that Mr Farage had fallen under the influence of ""inexperienced"" advisers.UKIP has also confirmed the departure of Mr Farage's chief of staff Raheem Kassam.Mr Farage ruled out quitting as leader on BBC's Question Time on Thursday, saying he had ""phenomenal"" support, and has challenged his critics to decide whether they want to stay in the party.In his article, Mr Carswell had said that ""knowing how difficult it is to lead a party makes me admire Nigel Farage all the more"".""I know that I never could,"" he added, stressing that he would find it ""impossible to simultaneously lead UKIP, be the voice of the party in the Commons, represent my Clacton constituents and at the same time be a husband and a dad"".However, he said that ""even leaders need to take a break"", adding: ""Nigel needs to take a break now.""UKIP got nearly four million votes at the election, but returned only one MP - former Conservative Mr Carswell in the Clacton constituency."

Under the plans, ministers could force schools rated as ""requiring improvement"" and missing new government benchmarks to become an academy.Coasting schools have average results which have often flatlined over time.Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, Mrs Morgan said faster action was needed.She said: ""Our big priorities will be to speed up the process for tackling failing schools; extend our academies programme to tackle 'coasting' schools; and deliver on our commitment to open new free schools.""The proposals will be in a new bill due to be introduced in the Queen's Speech. ""First, we will take new powers to step in from the moment that a school is found to be failing,"" Mrs Morgan said.""From day one, regional schools commissioners will be able to bring in new leadership and support from other excellent schools and heads, and we will speed up the process of turning schools into academies to make sure that new expert leadership is found for all schools that need it as quickly as possible.""She said that coasting schools will be put on an immediate notice to improve and could then be taken over and turned into an academy.They will be required to work with a team of ""expert"" head teachers.She said: ""Those that aren't able to demonstrate a clear plan for improvement will be given new leadership - we know this works in turning schools around.""More than 3,300 schools in England are labelled ""requires improvement"", but the plans are unlikely to cover that many schools.Under the current system, secondary schools are considered to be failing, and therefore eligible for intervention, if fewer than 40% of their students score at least five Cs at GCSE, including English and maths, and they do not meet national averages in pupil progress.In primary schools, the threshold for intervention is if fewer than 65% of pupils get Level 4 in reading, writing and maths and a below average number of pupils make the expected amount of progress.It is not yet clear how coasting schools will be deemed in need of intervention.It is understood that a new category will be devised covering schools which are rated as ""requires improvement"" and which fail to meet a new set of standards on improvement."

The AGM also included a vote on new corporate governance procedures which would mean members having less of a direct say.The Co-operative Group is still recovering from a period of financial mismanagement and some members have recently expressed concerns about how elections to the board are chosen.The banking arm of the group came close to collapse in 2013, bringing the whole group to a £2.5bn annual loss that year. The Co-op Party includes among its members a number of Labour MPs, including shadow chancellor Chris Leslie and Walthamstow MP Stella Creasy. The politicians stand as candidates of both the Co-operative Party and the Labour Party, and the two political movements have strong historical ties. The board asked the members of the Co-operative Group whether they wanted to continue financially supporting the Co-operative Party, or any other party. Allan Leighton, chairman of the Co-op Group, said: ""There's a clear remit from the members to continue to support the Labour Party.""It allows us to now have a conversation with the Co-op Labour Party about what we do next.""There was also a members' motion on the agenda, put forward by those in favour of making political donations of up to £1m a year.The motion to approve political funding ""not to exceed £1m per annum"" was carried by 55.17% to 44.83%.BBC business correspondent Joe Lynam said: ""To meet a £1.5bn hole in its accounts - mostly stemming from its banking division - the Co-op Group has had to sell off parts of its businesses and hand over majority control of its bank to American hedge funds.""It's also in the process of radically changing the way it runs itself into a more corporate structure with less of a direct say by its members.""He said that ""in theory"", each of the 2.8 million Co-op members could vote on a series of motions about the reforms, as well as how its bosses are paid, and retaining the links to the Co-operative party.One of the group's largest independent societies, Midcounties, recently threatened legal action over a shortlist of six candidates for the group's board being reduced to three - the number of positions available - before a member vote.

""We'll crack down hard on tax avoidance and aggressive tax planning by the rich - because everyone should pay their fair share.  ""We will always protect the most vulnerable, but we also need a welfare system that's fair to the people who pay for it. If you can work you should be working, so we'll take the next steps in our benefit reforms to make sure that happens.""Second, we've got to go on helping businesses create jobs in Britain, so we move towards full employment. That means facing a hard truth: in Britain we produce about a quarter less for every hour we work than countries like America or Germany. Fixing that long-running productivity weakness is the big challenge for the next five years.""So in the Budget we'll spend less on welfare, and instead invest to create three million more apprenticeships, so that young people can learn a trade, get better jobs and earn more.""After the Budget in March independent forecaster the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said that Mr Osborne needed to spell out exactly how he plans to cut £12bn from welfare spending.Of those £12bn planned cuts, £2bn were outlined ahead of the general election - all the cuts are supposed to be in place by 2017-18.Labour's shadow energy and climate change secretary, Caroline Flint, accused the Tories of making ""a number of uncosted promises"" during the election campaign.She told the BBC: ""It will be interesting to see who is going to pay for those uncosted policies when they bring the Budget in July."""

If it isn't, stop it and do something else.""He also criticised Mr Farage's comments about HIV patients during the TV leaders' debate last month.While debating about the NHS, Mr Farage said: ""You can come into Britain from anywhere in the world and get diagnosed with HIV and get the retro-viral drugs that cost up to £25,000 per year per patient.""Mr Carswell wrote: ""By all means we should highlight the problem of health tourism. But we need to admit that using the example of HIV patients to make the point was ill-advised.""He said the party needed to strike ""the right tone"" and added: ""UKIP has been at its most persuasive when we have been most optimistic.""Anger is never a great way to motivate people - at least not for very long.""The party has been beset by wrangling since Mr Farage agreed to stay on as leader, days after standing down after failing to get elected in Thanet South.He had pledged before the general election that he would quit the post if he failed to get elected to Parliament.Matthew Richardson has left the party, following claims from MEP Patrick O'Flynn that Mr Farage had fallen under the influence of ""inexperienced"" advisers.

They absolutely loved how he helped them and he was a highly-regarded local MP,"" Mr Bone said.""He stood up for what was right rather than what the party line was. In those days - the John Major years - it was much more difficult to stand up against the party machine. He had strong views on Europe.""Sir Peter started his career as an insurance broker, joining the Wycombe Young Conservatives in 1949 and the Oxford University Conservative Association in 1951.He went on to become a Conservative councillor on Buckinghamshire County Council between 1961 and 1967.Wellingborough mayor-elect Barry Graves also paid tribute to Sir Peter, remembering him as a ""very strong constituency MP"".""I remember going out and canvassing with him and he would go everywhere. He knew the area and the people. He was very much a man of the local constituency.""He was ""a very approachable man"", Mr Graves added.Sir Peter was knighted in 1994. "

The Smith proposals included giving Holyrood the power to set income tax rates and bands, as well as control over a share of VAT and some welfare benefits. But Ms Sturgeon's SNP also wants the Scottish Parliament to be given powers over business taxes, employment law, the minimum wage and additional powers over welfare.Speaking after meeting Ms Sturgeon, Mr Cameron told the BBC: ""Let's make sure Smith is implemented in full. I'm going to keep the commitment I made to the people of Scotland. Let's get that done first because it does create a really strong Scottish Parliament.""He added: ""Of course, if people want to make future proposals I'll look at them.""The prime minister again said he did not support full fiscal autonomy for Scotland - the responsibility for all areas of tax and spending except defence and foreign affairs - stating that it would mean £7bn of cuts or extra tax-raising.What Nicola Sturgeon is trying to say is she has a mandate. She has 56 out of the 59 MPs elected in Scotland and she won 50% of the vote - unprecedented here in Scotland.She says that gives her leverage to push David Cameron. David Cameron says he wants to keep the nation together.The language coming out of Westminster last week was very much a cordial one. 'We will listen'.Nicola Sturgeon has warned him that if he doesn't listen, then the people of Scotland will judge him accordingly.Ms  Sturgeon described the hour-long talks at her official residence at Bute House as ""constructive and business-like"". She said Mr Cameron had made a ""commitment"" that the Smith proposals would be implemented ""as agreed"".""But secondly the prime minister agreed that he would look at proposals that we would now send to suggest the areas we can go beyond Smith,"" Ms Sturgeon said.""There was no agreement in terms of the substance of that but we will submit those proposals, the prime minister has said they will consider them and there will be a meeting to look at how we take that further forward.""Referring to her party's success in last week's general election, which saw the SNP win 56 out of 59 Scottish seats, Ms Sturgeon said: ""People in Scotland have now voted fairly convincingly for the SNP and sent a message that we want the Smith Commission proposals to go further and be built on.""The ball is in his court but I'm going into this in good faith.""She added: ""David Cameron and I are a world apart politically but, where we can, I'm determined to do business in the interests of the people of Scotland and across the UK.""She said she would have a ""constructive and business-like"" relationship with the prime minister. The two leaders shook hands on the front steps of Bute House as Mr Cameron arrived. Mr Cameron left the building shortly before 11:00, almost an hour after he had arrived.The two sides agreed to hold more regular discussions in the future, possibly quarterly. "

I'm human, the rest of my life is more important to me than politics.""The shadow business secretary has been distressed by the degree of scrutiny he, his family and his girlfriend have come under since he declared his intention to stand for the labour leadership.I am told that this includes reporters waiting outside the houses of relatives late at night.Friends of Mr Umunna deny that he is nervous of not getting the support of enough MPs to run for the leadership; they point out that he already has half the necessary names and that there are some weeks to go.The shadow business secretary now wants to play a leading role in arguing that Britain should stay in the EU and does not rule out seeking the leadership in the future.He said he thought he had understood ""the scrutiny and attention a leadership contest would bring"", but added: ""However, since the night of our defeat last week I have been subject to the added level of pressure that comes with being a leadership candidate.""The shadow business secretary said he had wondered if it was too soon for him to stand for the leadership, and ""I fear it was."" He also cited concerns about the impact on ""the rest of one's life"" and those close to him.""Consequently, after further reflection, I am withdrawing my candidacy,"" he said.Mr Umunna said he would continue to serve as shadow business secretary and hoped to ""play a leading role"" in Labour's campaign to keep the UK in the EU during the forthcoming in/out referendum.Commenting on the news, Labour former culture secretary Ben Bradshaw - who is expected to run for deputy leader - said Mr Umunna was a ""terrible loss"" to the field.He told the BBC's Daily Politics the Streatham MP had been the candidate the Conservative Party ""feared the most"".""And if it's the result of pressure on an extended family or an extended group of friends, I think that's a very sad reflection on our political culture,"" he said.Chuka Umunna feels ""liberated"", he told me, by his decision to quit the Labour leadership race.He hopes to be given a good role (shadow chancellor, I wonder?) by whoever becomes Labour leader. And I expect he'll become very high profile in the campaign to keep Britain in Europe, which is increasingly looking like it will be next May.He'll endorse a candidate in the next four weeks before nominations close. It will be very interesting to see who he piles in behind.Read more from Allegra (see post 13.23).Former Labour leader Lord Kinnock said he thought Mr Umunna had made the right decision.He said: ""If he felt in his soul that he wasn't prepared to subject himself - and more importantly his family - to the kind of attention which is fairly typical, sadly, these days, he has done absolutely the right thing.""There is no point at all in inflicting avoidable, unnecessary misery on those you love most.""Leadership contender Mary Creagh said she had ""huge respect"" for Mr Umunna, telling BBC Radio 4's World at One programme it took ""courage"" to withdraw from the leadership race.Mr Umunna was ""a big beast"" and would play a ""big role"" in the future of the Labour Party, she added.Yvette Cooper, Andy Burnham, Liz Kendall and Mary Creagh have already thrown their hats into the ring for Labour's top job while a number of other potential candidates, including Dan Jarvis, Alan Johnson and David Lammy, have ruled themselves out. Candidates must secure nominations from 34 colleagues - 15% of the party's MPs - by 15 June to make it on to ballot papers, which will be sent to members in August ahead of the leader's election a month later."

However, Mr Justice Stuart Smith at Southwark Crown Court said there was a ""very strong likelihood"" a custodial sentence would follow.The jury heard how Mote submitted numerous false expenses claims for payment for work that organisations had allegedly carried out on his behalf.Mote claimed the money was to pay whistleblowers in cash through third parties. He also said he had been ""targeted for being an anti-EU MEP.""During his time an MEP he also made £250,000 legitimate expenses claims.No date has been set for the sentencing."

Governing parties don't gain seats. Parties that have implemented painful cuts and are promising more certainly don't. Until that is the Conservative Party did - achieving what had seemed to be Mission Impossible - a Tory majority.Until that is David Cameron's personal triumph which triggered the near simultaneous resignation of his three principal opponents - Messrs Miliband, Clegg and Farage.   They did so in part because they helped to crush their partners in coalition these last five years - reducing the Liberal Democrat parliamentary party to a size when it can fit into two London taxis and still have two seats to spare.

2015-05-02,Round-up: BBC experts' analysis,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/election-2015-32650417,"The political future of the United Kingdom has become clearer after the results of the general election emerged around the country.David Cameron says he hopes to govern for all of the UK after the Conservatives took 331 seats - enough to form a slender majority in the Commons.Labour has been all but wiped out by the SNP in Scotland and suffered a disappointing set of results elsewhere, while the Lib Dems are left with just eight MPs after many party heavyweights such as Vince Cable and Danny Alexander lost their seats.So with battles won and lost and the fall-out and celebrations beginning, BBC correspondents examine the implications and challenges that lie ahead for the new government - and for those whose political careers have been ended by voters.No pollster, no pundit, no political leader saw it coming - not even David Cameron himself.Governing parties don't gain seats. Parties that have implemented painful cuts and are promising more certainly don't. Until that is the Conservative Party did - achieving what had seemed to be Mission Impossible - a Tory majority.Until that is David Cameron's personal triumph which triggered the near simultaneous resignation of his three principle opponents - Messrs Miliband, Clegg and Farage.They did so in part because they helped to crush their partners in coalition these last five years - reducing the Liberal Democrat parliamentary party to a size when it can fit into two London taxis and still have two seats to spare.In part because the extraordinary tidal wave of support for the SNP swept dozens of once safe Labour seats away.In part because Nigel Farage persuaded millions to vote for him but secured just one seat - not, though, the one he was standing in.Read more from Nick Robinson hereThe question uppermost in the prime minister's mind as he assembles his new government is how to keep the kingdom united.""Above all I want to bring our country together,"" he revealed after the result, ""to reclaim a mantle we should never have lost - the mantle of one nation, one United Kingdom"".Looking at the political landscape from Land's End today is very different to the view from John O'Groats.A sea of Conservative and Unionist blue dominates the scene across much of England, while a field of SNP nationalist yellow stretches to the horizon and beyond from the north.David Cameron's greatest challenge is to prevent the union he supports being torn apart by mutual resentment - resentment from Scotland at a Westminster government dominated by English Tories, and resentment from England at the preferential treatment people think is being given to the Scots.Those who assumed the future of the Union had been safeguarded by the Scottish referendum must think again.Read more from Mark Easton hereOne thing is rock-solid true: the Conservatives who worked on this campaign are as surprised by the result as the pollsters, pundits, politicians and general population.Maybe they shouldn't be - the economy is in good shape and the Conservatives had incumbency advantage.But when I travelled back from the prime minister's last rally with a group of exhausted Conservative campaign officials it was clear that 290 seats was a hoped-for target.No-one talked about anything over 300 seats, and no-one even mentioned an overall majority.So what special sauce pushed David Cameron into No 10 with a Commons majority?Mr Cameron had two simple messages in the campaign and he rarely veered away from them; the first - the economy is in good shape and the recovery is threatened by Labour. And the second - the SNP would hold a Labour-led government to ransom.Read more from Jonny Dymond hereBrian Taylor, BBC political editor, ScotlandOf all the comments on the overnight apocalypse, undoubtedly the most straightforward came from a defeated Scottish Labour MP.Since there were quite a few of them, let me narrow the focus a little. Come on down, Tom Harris.Mr Harris had plainly anticipated defeat. Nonetheless, he looked suitably lugubrious as his fate was confirmed.Why, he was asked eagerly, had Labour lost? ""Because we did not win enough votes.""Psephologically, it is perfect. Complete in itself. Psychologically, it sums up Labour's gloom without descending into subsidiary matters such as leadership, strategy and the rest. As a forward-thinking strategy, it is ideal. Win more votes. Simple.Read more from Brian Taylor hereThis has been an election which may have more profound consequences than almost any in living memory.We now face a generational decision about our future in Europe, with an EU referendum in two years' time almost certain.There will also be serious questions about the future of the Union, following an SNP landslide that has turned Scotland into a virtual one-party state.David Cameron's victory also represents a colossal achievement.Only once before in recent history has an incumbent government increased its majority - and that was Mrs Thatcher in her prime in the 1980s.It is also a significant personal victory for Mr Cameron and a rebuff for those in his party who had become increasingly sceptical about his ability to win.But while it may represent a defeat for those Tories who saw this election as a potential opportunity to rid themselves of David Cameron, he must now govern with a wafer-thin majority.For the SNP, their stunning victory can only increase the pressure on Nicola Sturgeon to include a commitment to a second independence referendum in her party's manifesto for next year's Scottish elections.It is an election which has not just defied all the predictions of the pollsters and pundits - but which may yet prompt the most fundamental re-casting of British politics for a generation.Read more from Norman Smith hereAfter an extraordinary night, some brief conclusions:Read more from James Landale hereIs this the end of the union?That is the question many people will be asking this morning after the party which has fought for Scottish independence for 80 years swept to victory.The answer from the jubilant Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon is a firm ""No"".She insists that her MPs will speak for all of Scotland, not just for the 45% who voted for the country to leave the United Kingdom last September.In the closing hours of the most extraordinary election campaign which anyone in Scotland can remember, Ms Sturgeon turned to talk of ""legitimacy.""That will be her watchword in the coming days as she argues that the prime minister cannot ignore the democratic will of the Scottish people.Politically, Scotland and England this morning look and feel like very different countries.Read more from James Cook hereAfter weeks of chatter about an election too close to call, it wasn't that close at all.David Cameron will be continuing as our prime minister.So, what is all this likely to mean?A referendum on whether the UK stays in, or leaves, the European Union, within the next two-and-a-half years.A race to be the next leader of the Labour Party.A race to be the next leader of the Liberal Democrats.And a huge new presence of Scottish National Party MPs at Westminster.And so here's another thing we know for certain this morning: Politics ain't going to be boring any time soon.Read more from Chris Mason hereFor Labour the story of their terrible night is rapidly turning into the search for a new leader. So who will that be?Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, is almost certain to run.  Even before this election, both he and another almost inevitable candidate, Chuka Umunna, had raised eyebrows inside the party at the work they had put in, preparing the ground with members and the unions for potential bids.Yvette Cooper, before the election, was still thought not to have made up her mind over whether to run. That decision has been made perhaps a little easier as her husband, Ed Balls, has lost his seat.She is certainly potentially in the frame, along with two lesser known names - Liz Kendall and Dan Jarvis - two MPs who were only elected in 2010 for the first time. This could be their moment. But whoever is in the job, they face a monumental task.Read Laura Kuenssberg's Twitter hereSterling is up (the most for seven years against the euro), share prices are up (especially bank shares like Lloyds and RBS, and energy shares such as Centrica), government bond prices are up.To state the obvious, investors love the Tories' general election victory.There are a few reasons.One (no surprise here) is that Labour's threat of breaking up banks and imposing energy price caps has been lifted.Second is that investors have been discounting days and weeks of wrangling after polling day over who would form the government - and so they are semi-euphoric that we already know who's in charge.Third, many investors tend to be economically conservative and instinctively Conservative.But although the City may be a bit drunk on the result, its pleasure in Ed Miliband's and Ed Balls' humiliation may be making it a bit blind - perhaps dangerously so - to some bumps in the economic road ahead.Read more from Robert Peston hereNigel Farage dreamed of holding the balance of power, but in the end his UKIP party is now worse off than when it came into the election.At the seventh time of asking he was rejected - this time by the people of Thanet South. It was a similar story in Rochester and Strood where Mark Reckless, who sensationally defected from the Tories last year, was also sent packing.In seats on UKIP's target list, like Thurrock in Essex, the party failed to make gains. In Grimsby - where Mr Farage went twice in the last six weeks - they came third.UKIP got around four million votes - with especially strong showings in north-east and south-east England - but it's ended up with just one MP, and a vacancy at the top. This has led to UKIP attacking the current system of choosing MPs, which it's described as ""busted"" and ""dysfunctional"".In one sense, this campaign was a complete failure and it's left an aftermath of angry voters, and others wondering if the UKIP bubble has burst.Read Robin Brant's Twitter hereI monitored 91 GB-wide voting intention polls during the 2015 election campaign and found nothing in them to prepare me for the final outcome.The good news for the pollsters was that their share for the Lib Dems was pretty close, as were the shares for UKIP, the Greens and the catch-all category of Others.The bad news for the polling industry was that the crucial shares for Conservative and Labour were the ones where they came most adrift.When all the qualifications of margins of error are allowed, there did appear to be a systematic overstatement of the Labour share and an equally systematic understatement of the Conservative one.It is for the pollsters to decide whether to conduct a review of their performance but I trust they will avoid the initial knee-jerk reaction of the immediate aftermath of the 1992 polls debacle.This general election performance follows the performance of the polls in the 2014 Scottish referendum where the choice was simply binary and yet all the polls were out by between 4-6%.Something is wrong. A lot of us would like to know what it is.Read more from David Cowling hereThe words ""political earthquake"" have been translated into numerous European languages, making front page news across the continent.While Britons now examine the domestic minutiae of the election result, here in mainland Europe the vote means one thing: a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU. And that has the potential to create an earthquake of its own.The guardian of the EU treaties Mr Cameron wants to change - Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker - has said again he'd listen to what Britain's new government proposed.Read more from Katya Adler here"

2015-05-02,A history of political plots,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32749971,"Nigel Farage has apparently seen off a challenge to his leadership of UKIP - a move described by his former election strategist as a ""coup"". He's not the only party leader to face an attempted ousting. But can you recover from such a revolt?In 2006, the Labour prime minister was the target of what became known as the ""curry house conspiracy"" - a coup to remove him and install his chancellor, Gordon Brown, as prime minister.It would lead to several of the plotters' resignations - but not Mr Blair's. However, it was successful to a degree in that it forced the party leader into naming a departure date.The move against him was reportedly masterminded by Tom Watson, a defence minister at the time, who was also rumoured to have had a secret meeting with Mr Brown on the eve of the revolt.Apparently, Mr Watson and three fellow West Midlands MPs - Sion Simon, David Wright (both ministerial aides) and Khalid Mahmood - met over a biryani at a Wolverhampton curry house to discuss the PM's future, before dispatching a missive calling for him to quit.The letter - which attracted the support of a number of normally loyal Labour MPs - was leaked to the press, and ultimately resulted in Mr Watson's resignation.In his parting letter, the West Bromwich East MP took a shot at the prime minister, who he said should step down in the interests of party and country.Mr Blair denounced his actions and branded the former minister ""disloyal, discourteous and wrong"", saying he would have sacked him if he had not resigned.But Mr Watson's departure was swiftly followed by the resignations of six other junior members of government - who had also signed the rebel letter - in protest at the prime minister's refusal to say when he would step down as Labour leader.The whole affair resulted in Mr Blair announcing his intention to step aside within 12 months - which he duly did, on 27 June 2007.But it did nothing to quash internal dissent and speculation in the party over the future leadership of the party.Labour prime minister Gordon Brown found his leadership under threat in 2009 after one of his cabinet ministers dramatically quit the government and called for him to resign.Work and Pensions Secretary James Purnell - a former aide to Tony Blair - resigned from his post after the polls closed in the local and European elections, in which Labour was forecast to do badly.Explaining his decision to quit, Mr Purnell said the prime minister made a Conservative victory ""more, not less, likely"".It was Mr Brown's first direct challenge from a cabinet minister - but it would not topple the Labour leader as senior members of government refused to follow Mr Purnell's lead.Mr Brown was safe for the time being. But several months later, in January 2010, a fresh leadership challenge was mounted by two senior former Labour cabinet ministers.Geoff Hoon and Patricia Hewitt wrote to all Labour MPs, saying the party was ""deeply divided"" over Mr Brown's leadership and that the best way to resolve the issue was by way of secret ballot.They insisted it was not an ""attempted coup"" but a necessary step to resolve divisions within the party.But the duo could only muster the public support of a handful of backbenchers long-opposed to Mr Brown, with the majority of the party's MPs less than impressed by the move, which came just weeks before the general election.As the day wore on, a succession of cabinet ministers came out to back the PM, suggesting there was little momentum behind the plot - although it was noted that several were not exactly gushing in their support of Mr Brown.As history tells us, neither leadership challenge bore fruit but they reflected the internal doubts and divisions over Mr Brown at the helm.As leadership toppling attempts go, this one in 2014 was regarded as a particularly ""botched"" and ""shambolic coup"". Indeed, former Lib Dem leader Lord (Paddy) Ashdown described the move as a ""plot of deep malice"".Its instigator, Lord (Matthew) Oakeshott - a close ally of the-then Business Secretary Vince Cable - tried to unseat Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg.The peer was found to have commissioned secret polls suggesting the party would do better at the 2015 general election without Mr Clegg in the driving seat.The man Lord Oakeshott had long had in mind to take Mr Clegg's place - Mr Cable, who was on government business in China at the time - was forced to publicly condemn his friend's actions and state his backing for Mr Clegg.But Lord Oakeshott said the business secretary had in fact known about his polls and their findings.Nevertheless, the peer - who was denounced by the Lib Dem leadership for spending money that could have been spent on campaigning - quit the party, and issued a warning shot on his way out about the Lib Dems' future prospects.Mr Cable largely emerged unscathed but he faced questions about his loyalty to the leader. Although the two sought to put paid to reports of a rift with a (painfully awkward, 'nothing to see here, folks') stage-managed pint in a pub.Although the revolt failed, and Mr Clegg remained at the helm, the Lib Dems did go on to suffer a trouncing at the general election, losing nearly 50 of its MPs - one of them, Mr Cable himself - prompting his leader to quit.The Conservatives have a reputation for being more ruthless than their party rivals when it comes to getting rid of leaders they sense are no longer effectual.But, in 1995, Prime Minister John Major - tired of persistent rumours of a leadership challenge - decided to take the bull by the horns and trigger a surprise leadership election to silence his detractors.His own backbenchers had questioned Mr Major's ability to unite and lead the party, which was deeply divided over Europe.So ""put up or shut up"", he told them as he tendered his resignation as Conservative Party leader but not prime minister.But then stepped forward eurosceptic MP John Redwood, who resigned from the cabinet in order to contest Mr Major's leadership.This was unexpected by many, as the PM had said there had been assurances from his cabinet that none would stand against him.But Mr Major went on to win the ensuing election with a comfortable defeat over his challenger, who was not included in the PM's consequent cabinet reshuffle.No further contested leadership election took place until after the Conservatives' defeat at the 1997 general election, paving the way for William Hague to take over the running of the party.Not all attempts to oust a party leader end in failure: as Margaret Thatcher found out to her peril.With three electoral victories under her belt, the Conservative prime minister's downfall would come at the hands of her own party - not the voters.It was on 1 November 1990 when Geoffrey (now Lord) Howe - one of Mrs Thatcher's longest-serving ministers - resigned over differences with the party leader over Europe.In his now infamous speech on the floor of the House of Commons, he attacked the PM's policies and leadership style, comparing being one of her cabinet ministers to opening the batting at cricket only to find his bat had been ""broken... by the team captain"".It sparked the beginning of the end of the 11-year Thatcher reign.Michael (now Lord) Heseltine seized on the opportunity to challenge the prime minister in the ensuing leadership contest, from which she would eventually withdraw and John Major emerge as her successor. Reflecting on the revolt and its implications on the Conservative Party, Baroness Thatcher's biographer Charles Moore wrote: ""Because the coup was unjustified, and so trust broke down, the politics of the next 15 years were those of civil war."""
2015-05-02,Election swings and roundabouts,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-32741924,"If election manifesto claims are all about smoke and mirrors, should we now add swings and roundabouts to the political metaphor?There's an intriguing aspect to the general election results in the Midlands that puzzled me.It's the striking contrast in the swings between Labour and the Conservatives.David Cameron and his campaign strategists knew they were home and dry when Nuneaton was the first Midlands marginal to declare.It was not only a Tory hold but a swing to the Conservatives from Labour of 3%.I was in the Nottingham suburb of Beeston awaiting the result of the Broxtowe count. Would its high profile Conservative MP Anna Soubry survive a red surge?Nuneaton set the pattern. Across the Midlands, both east and west, there was a uniform swing of between three and four per cent to the Tories - Warwickshire North 3%, Amber Valley 4%, Derbyshire South 4% and Sherwood 4%. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan topped the Tory swingometer in the Midlands marginals with 5% in Loughborough.Yet in the big cities, it was a very different story. The swing went to Labour.So in Nottingham East they enjoyed a 6% swing, Nottingham South 5.8%, Leicester South 7.3%, Leicester West 5%, Birmingham Hall Green 12%, Birmingham Hodge Hill 8%.If swings to Labour on this scale had gone beyond the city ring road roundabouts and into the suburbs, Ed Miliband would have become prime minister by now.In confidence, one senior Labour insider in Nottingham told me its success in the city wards was down to organisation, experience and its teams of activists.""We won the ground war. If Nottingham's city boundaries were extended into Sherwood and Broxtowe, we would have won those constituencies as well,"" he told me.Labour leadership candidate, Leicester West's Liz Kendall has identified her party's problem beyond the ring road roundabout.It's about reaching out to Middle England.""We need to show people that we understand their aspirations and ambitions for the future,"" she told the Sunday Times.The problem for Labour was that Middle England was not interested in what the party offered…and still isn't. The Cameron brand worked its magic in those Midlands marginals... it'll take something or someone special to break up that ballot box relationship."
2015-05-02,Royal 'lobbying',https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32740154,"Prince Charles sent 27 letters to then Prime Minister Tony Blair and members of his government between September 2004 and March 2005, ""despite the Freedom of Information Act!"" as the prince joked in one.But did his suggestions and concerns have any bearing on the behaviour of Mr Blair's government?The request: Prince Charles expresses his worries over an EU directive on complementary medicines ""which is… effectively outlawing the use of certain herbal extracts"".  Mr Blair replied, offering moral support and practical help. He agreed that ""the implementation as it is currently planned is crazy"" and set out an action plan that included delaying implementation for all existing products to 2011. What happened: Herbal products were not required to be authorised until 2011, just as Mr Blair had promised. Prince Charles continues to sell his own brand of complementary products, Duchy Herbals, through Boots and Waitrose. The request: Writing to Mr Blair, the prince expresses a ""growing sense of anxiety"" that the Hill Farming Allowance, which supports farmers working on Britain's uplands, could be scrapped. In his reply, the prime minister said he understood that the Hill Farm Allowance would continue until 2007. What happened: The allowance lasted until the end of Labour's tenure in 2010, when it was abolished.The request: Just 18 months after the US-led invasion of Iraq, Prince Charles raised the issue of poor performance of Lynx helicopters in high temperatures, saying: ""I fear that this is just one more example of where our Armed Forces are being asked to do an extremely challenging job (particularly in Iraq) without the necessary resources.""Mr Blair replied: ""On the subject of the Lynx helicopter, the limitations of the existing platform, particularly in the extremely challenging environment within Iraq, are well recognised by the Ministry of Defence."" He added that replacement of the helicopters would be a priority. What happened: Mr Blair's comments go much further than what he was saying about the subject at the time. In the event, though, the fleet was not fully upgraded until 2011.The request: Prince Charles lamented that the government's TB prevention plans might not ""include a commitment to deal with the badger problem in the immediate future"" and pushed strongly for a cull, saying: ""All I can say is that I do urge you to look again at introducing a proper cull of badgers where it is necessary.""Mr Blair sympathised, saying he could ""personally see the case for culling badgers"". However, he was unwilling to commit to a cull.  What happened: Culling trials were conducted from 1998-2005. The final results, published in 2008, said that the badger cull could ""make no meaningful contribution"" to curbing bovine TB. It wasn't until 2013 that a full culling programme began in two pilot areas. These ended with the conclusion that the pilots had been neither humane nor effective at curbing the spread of TB.The request: Then Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell wrote to Prince Charles to say she had decided to give parts of the historic Smithfield meat market Grade II listed status, and was trying to persuade deputy prime minister John Prescott to ""call in"" the planning application to prevent demolition of other parts of the site. She had been swayed by evidence provided by Sir Neil Cossons, who was English Heritage chair at the time, after he had been asked by the prince to add his support. Prince Charles replied that he was ""extremely glad to read of your appreciation of the value of this group of buildings"". According to the Guardian, market workers desperate to see the redevelopment of the site invited the prince to meet them to discuss it, but his office said he was ""unlikely to accept as he did not want to interfere in the planning process"".What happened: Smithfield market is still the subject of planning battles a decade on. Successive planning applications have been refused by ministers. Last year then Communities Secretary Eric Pickles rejected plans for an office development on the site, stating that ""the extent of damage that the application would cause to the important heritage assets at Smithfield runs entirely counter to national and policy objectives intended to protect such assets from harm"".In March, the Museum of London announced a move from its current Barbican site to the Smithfield market building."

""Good party, wrong leader, they don't look after business enough.""Councillor John Stanley tells me: ""I think in a way we did go too left, but now we can go a bit centre-left, or centre, depending who the new leader is.""The former mayor sums up the mood on the doorstep: ""Whatever we told them, they didn't believe us.""  Expect to hear all those views, and more, in the coming leadership contest. Step back from the angst of supporters, and it may not be that hard to see why Labour failed.  An economic recovery, hailed by independent organisations as the result of government policy, undid a party that had loudly proclaimed for five years that the coalition's policies would lead to economic disaster. Combine that with an uncharismatic and uninspirational leader, then you might argue no further debate is necessary.Fat chance of that. Defeat breeds resentment, and this one has opened up old divisions.  A chorus of Blairties, led by the man himself, has declared that Ed's problem was ignoring those with aspiration and ambition, failing to appeal to those running business. Incidentally, I've been ticked off by the perspicacious editor of the New Statesman, Jason Cowley, for using the ""unhelpful"" term ""Blairites"".I can't think of another description that fits Tony, Lord Mandelson, Lord Adonis and David Miliband quite so well. But call them what you will, the message was clear - Ed was too left wing, Labour should move back to the centre, or, if you like, to the right.Reading Mr Blair's pithy analysis, listening to Lord Mandelson's gripping and savage eloquence, describing a party sent out to shout: ""We love the poor and hate the rich,"" and so ignoring the middle, and you realise strong emotions are in play.But back to the future may not be sufficient. Of course elections are won on the centre ground. But grandees grinding axes, affronted by the failure of boys who used to make their tea, may be creating so much noise that they can't hear more insistent sounds.  For there are several elephants trumpeting loudly as they cram into the small space of the shadow cabinet room. Imagine these beasts are as gaily decorated as Berlin buddy bears. One is decked out in red, another in imperial purple bunting, and another, a mammoth, strong tusked and ice rimmed, painted yellow with tartan trimmings.Take the last first. The Scottish wipeout is Labour's biggest problem. Fail to solve it, and Labour can forget ever having a comfortable majority again. It is hard to argue Labour were wiped out in Scotland because the SNP outflanked them to the right with their appeal to the business community and the ambitious and aspirational. But it is true the SNP drew in to people from left, right and centre, just as the modernisers say Labour should. It was the politics of economic self-interest, but cast in a very different light. Tribally sneering at ""the reactionary ideology of nationalism"" as Mr Blair does, will not reach the central belt of Scotland, the middle ground of  Midlothian.What about that purple pachyderm?  In Crawley - in fact in seat after seat - there is a similar pattern.  Labour did, in fact, often increase the size of their vote. So did the Conservatives, usually by a bit more. But the real dynamic was the total collapse of the Lib Dems and the dramatic rise of UKIP. The increase in votes for Nigel Farage's party wasn't translated into parliamentary seats, but, although it is early days in terms of research, it probably hurt Labour a lot. If we believe - and I do - Matthew Goodwin and Rob Ford, authors of Revolt on the Right, these voters are often former Labour supporters - older, less educated, those left behind on the tides of  globalisation, stranded on the shores of post-industrialisation. They may have had too many disappointments to feel much ambition or aspiration. They are a challenge for Labour, and any new leader will spend a good deal of time thinking how to deal with the concerns of Europe and immigration.Whether to share their fears, or confront them will be a big decision.Which brings us to Red Nellie. Those members who still proudly call themselves socialist. This is not about Old Labour - they are more likely to be baristas or barristers than boilermakers. It is easy as an outsider, as a journalist, to treat politics as an intellectual game about how best to win power - but many people, particularly the foot soldiers, particularly after the death of  purely tribal loyalties, are in it because they passionately believe in winning  power to do something specific.Many of them are suspicious of the later incarnations of New Labour, not because it reached an accommodation with wealth and business, but because it seemed to worship at the same altar, to regard the party's core beliefs in redistribution and equality as childish fantasies from a past age.Perhaps to Mr Blair, they are the problem, people who may equate ""ambition"" with greed. They might point out that a man who claims to be worth ""only"" £20m may find it harder than most to squeeze through the eye of a needle to understand their point of view. Most successful Labour leaders will confront the left at some point, but the concerns of this group go to the existential question ""What is the party for?""This is not a polemic - not an argument about what should be done, but a reflection on the complex conundrums that will face any new Labour leader, the tearing apart of the old alliance that made up a Labour majority, and so the political need to satisfy groups with very different, indeed, contradictory demands. But looking for a Social Democratic universal theory of everything may be missing the point. What the party desperately wants is a leader who can pull the disparate threads together and articulate them as common purpose. Whether she or he exists is another matter.Much more on that in the coming months."
2015-05-02,'Take us with you',https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-32736153,"Thousands of people in the north of England have been using the hashtag ""take us with you Scotland"" to express their upset about the result of last week's general election, and Scottish nationalists are welcoming this English minority with open arms. Last Thursday's general election was a rough one for the Labour Party in its traditional stronghold in the north of England. But further to the north, the left-leaning Scottish National Party won nearly every seat it contested. That political contrast has made some left-wing voters in places like Manchester, Leeds and Sheffield look fondly on their neighbours. Since last Thursday's election in Britain the phrase ""take us with you Scotland"" has been used more than 24,000 times. ""Genuinely beginning to wonder if the North of England becoming a part of Scotland would be better for us, I really am,"" tweeted Aaron Miller from Yorkshire. Some cracked jokes under the tag after the North West Motorway Police account, which gives traffic updates, announced that they had ""picked up a pedestrian on the M62 who was trying to walk to Scotland.""After an initial spike of jokes over the weekend, the hashtag really took off when users start to mobilise in support of around a year-old petition on the campaigning site Change.org. The petition calls for the north of England to secede from the rest of the country and join up with Scotland, and more than 12,000 people have signed it.Its creator, a Sheffield resident who calls himself ""Stu Dent"", set it up to coincide with last year's Scottish independence referendum, and he also created a map imagining the boundary of a ""Scotland plus the north"" country.Stu Dent runs the Twitter account Hunters Bar, named after an area of southwest Sheffield which is very popular with - you guessed it - students. Despite the account having thousands of followers on Twitter, when the map was first posted last year, the image was shared only about 100 times - however, in the past week it's been retweeted by thousands. Stu Dent told BBC Trending that he was surprised at how popular his idea has become. ""In hindsight, perhaps I shouldn't have been,"" he said. ""There is a huge frustration in parts of the UK about the things that have happened since 2010.""""I think people need a place to go where they can say 'not in my name! This is not the England I want',"" he added. But in addition to disappointment from some quarters about the election result, there might be another reason why the petition is getting a boost now: the power of the Scottish Nationalists on Twitter. What started as a post-election joke in the North of England was quickly embraced by the so-called ""Cyber Nats"" - and a trend was born.The SNP's social media strategist Ross Colquhoun expressed the party's mood about the hashtag best, in a post which was shared more than 500 times. ""2014: #LetsStayTogether 2015: #TakeUsWithYouScotland What a difference a year makes"" he tweeted.Blog by Hannah HendersonNext story: The sport reporter and the obscene ranter who lost his jobFollow BBC Trending on Twitter @BBCtrending, and find us on Facebook."
2015-05-02,What Britain wants from Europe,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32695399,"David Cameron says he has a mandate to pursue EU reform following the Conservatives' general election victory. The PM, who will be hoping his majority government will give him extra leverage in Brussels, wants to renegotiate the terms of the UK's membership ahead of a referendum by the end of 2017. He has said he will campaign for Britain to remain in the EU if he gets the reforms he wants.Mr Cameron has said he does not want to reveal full details of his negotiating hand but he has given a broad indication, in a series of speeches and newspaper articles, of his priorities when he goes into talks with other EU leaders.These are: The prime minister has said Britain would resist any move towards a European Army and that he wants to free British police forces from EU interference. He has also ruled out Britain joining the euro.But he has placed less emphasis in recent years on demanding changes to EU social policy, such as the maximum 48-hour working week, agency workers, maternity leave and non-discrimination rules.The official UK government position is that a referendum will be held by the end of 2017 but Downing Street sources have said: ""If we can do it earlier we will.""There is speculation David Cameron is planning to hold the vote in 2016 to avoid a clash with French and German elections in 2017.The prime minister wants treaty change but even if the referendum was held in 2017 there may not be enough time to legally incorporate any reforms into a treaty and it would have to be done at a later stage.An early referendum would anger Eurosceptics who believe it would not allow enough time to make the case for exit or negotiate any meaningful concessions.""A rushed process would severely undermine the chances to secure a significant deal that both British business and voters could support and would waste the opportunity of a lifetime,"" Matthew Elliott, chief executive of Business for Britain told Breitbart London.The question is always crucial in any referendum and there is already a debate about what it should be. The Draft European Union (Referendum) Bill, published by the Conservatives in 2013, proposed this form of words: ""Do you think that the United Kingdom should remain a member of the European Union?""Some thought that leaned too far towards the status quo, encouraging a yes vote, and the Electoral Commission said it was not clear and direct enough. The watchdog proposed this form of words instead: ""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union?""The new Conservative government will attempt to repeal the Human Rights Act, which requires UK courts to treat the European Court of Human Rights as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. The European Court of Human Rights is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe (CoE), which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine.The freedom for people to move around Europe, enshrined in the EU treaties, works in parallel with the other three basic freedoms in the single market: freedom of goods, capital and services.It is likely to be a ""red line"" for other EU leaders, who do not want to see it eroded.Mr Cameron has steered clear of tackling it directly - for example by asking for an emergency ""brake"" on free movement, or a cap on numbers - focusing instead on reducing the incentive provided by welfare payments. In a speech last November, David Cameron set out measures to reduce the number of EU nationals moving to the UK.His main proposals were:Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission, has said he is ready to work with Mr Cameron to ""strike a fair deal for the United Kingdom in the EU"". The leaders of other EU nations have previously warned they are unlikely to support major changes to EU treaties to accommodate British demands. But Mr Cameron's general election victory may have given him extra leverage. ""The ball is very much in the court of the UK now,"" a senior EU official told The Guardian. ""It's up to the British to define what they want."" The key figure will be German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is very keen to keep Britain in the EU but has so far been unwilling to make major concessions to enable that to happen. There are fears that a ""pick and mix"" approach to EU treaties would undermine EU cohesion.Mr Cameron has said there is ""no doubt"" his planned reforms will require changes to the treaties governing the European Union. But this would require the unanimous support of all EU members, and may not be possible within the deadline he has set of a referendum before the end of 2017. Any attempt to change EU laws on free movement would meet fierce resistance from some EU nations, particularly Eastern European states. Mr Juncker has said free movement is non-negotiable.Mr Cameron may find it difficult to get unanimous support for his proposals for a four-year waiting period for migrant workers claiming UK benefits. East European EU members would be likely to oppose this, on the grounds that it would discriminate against their citizens.  Attempts to secure opt-outs for the City are unlikely to go down well with other European leaders.However, there are precedents for EU treaty changes to accommodate some countries' specific concerns - for example, the protocol attached to the Lisbon Treaty for Ireland.Mr Cameron has faced repeated calls to say whether he would campaign for Britain's exit from the EU in the referendum if he fails to get what he wants from the renegotiation process. All he has said is that he will ""rule nothing out"". Some Conservative MPs want Britain to leave the EU no matter what David Cameron manages to renegotiate. A larger group are likely to want more concessions than Mr Cameron has so far indicated he is prepared to demand.Senior backbencher David Davis, who was defeated by Mr Cameron for the Tory leadership in 2005, told the Daily Telegraph the majority of the 332 Conservative MPs want Mr Cameron to negotiate an ""opt-out"" power to stop individual EU laws from applying to Britain. The prime minister has said this would be ""impossible"" without Britain leaving the EU.Mr Davis claims as many as 60 Tory MPs would be prepared to rebel and vote for Britain's exit from the EU if the prime minister fails to deliver.Graham Brady, chairman of the Tory backbench 1922 committee, which represents backbenchers, has urged David Cameron to give all Conservative MPs, including ministers, a free vote in the EU referendum.In January, Mr Cameron warned that serving cabinet ministers would have to quit the government if they wanted to campaign to leave the EU if he had secured the reforms to it he wants.In the 1975 referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Economic Community, as the EU was then called, Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson decided to suspend collective responsibility because his cabinet was split on the issue. Ministers were allowed to vote with their consciences and campaign against each other. The majority of them, including Mr Wilson, joined the Yes camp, but left-wingers, such as Tony Benn, played a leading role in the No campaign. The Yes campaign won easily with 67% of the vote."

2015-05-03,Scots Labour leader Murphy to resign,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32760196,"Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy is to resign next month, he has announced.It comes despite Mr Murphy narrowly surviving a vote of no confidence at a meeting of the party's national executive in Glasgow. Mr Murphy said he would tender his resignation alongside a plan to reform the party.He lost his seat in last week's general election as the SNP won 56 of the 59 Scottish seats, leaving Labour with a single MP in Scotland.Mr Murphy said he wanted to have a successor as leader in place by the summer, and confirmed he would not be standing for a seat at the Scottish Parliament in next year's election. Instead, he said it was time to ""do something else"" and that he believed the party would continue to be divided if he remained as leader. His deputy, Kezia Dugdale MSP, will become acting leader until a permanent successor is found. Mr Murphy had faced calls to resign from several MSPs, trade unions and former MPs in the wake of his party's near wipeout at the general election.He insisted he had decided to stand down ahead of the national executive voting by 17-14 in favour of him staying in the job.Speaking at a media conference after the national executive meeting, he said: ""It is clear that a small minority who didn't accept my election as leader of the Scottish Labour Party just five months ago won't accept the vote of the executive today and that will continue to divide the party.""Today I received more support in the executive vote than I did from members of the executive when I stood for election five months ago.""He said it would be up to the executive whether to accept the reforms he would be proposing before he left the post. But he warned: ""A party in such urgent need of reform blocks those changes at its peril.""The former East Renfrewshire MP said Labour had been crushed between ""two nationalisms"" in Scotland and England.Mr Murphy said he left no legacy of bitterness for anyone in the Labour Party, and the only person he was angry at was the person who blamed Scottish Labour for the party's UK-wide general election defeat - a reference to Unite leader Len McCluskey.And he said that in many ways Scottish Labour was the ""least modernised part of the Labour movement"" and that he wanted his successor to be elected under a one member, one vote system.Mr Murphy added: ""The Labour Party's problem is not the link with trade unions, or even the relationship with Unite members - far from it. It is the destructive behaviour of one high profile trade unionist.""The leader of the Scottish Labour Party doesn't serve at the grace of Len McCluskey, and the next leader of the UK Labour Party should not be picked by Len McCluskey.""Mr McCluskey has been a vocal critic of Mr Murphy's leadership and opposed his appointment in December when Mr Murphy won the contest to replace Johann Lamont.Jim Murphy laughed and joked with Scottish Labour's sole MP as he made his way down the hotel corridor to announce his resignation.He certainly brought energy and dynamism to his election campaign - but all that achieved was Ian Murray in Edinburgh South.So as Mr Murphy bows out, who could replace him?The deputy leader Kezia Dugdale may want to step up or Neil Findlay could try again after challenging last time. Maybe the party's finance spokeswoman Jackie Baillie thinks her steady hand could steer the ship.Jenny Marra is also often talked about as future face of the party.Whoever steps into Jim Murphy's red shoes he or she will have to face a difficult 2016 Holyrood election, to put it mildly.There are also more fundamental questions about how the party can possibly move on as it faces a surging SNP.Mr Murphy was very much a creature of ""New Labour"" - but to today's generation that's old Labour.Party members may start looking for someone with no links to the past, neither a Brownite nor a Blairite. A 'cleanskin' - as the politicos put it - may well help re-connect with voters.That's a long way from now though - even some of the party's opponents may view this latest train wreck with a modicum of sympathy. Ms Lamont had resigned after claiming Scottish Labour was treated like a ""branch office"" by the London-based party leadership.Mr Murphy concluded his speech by saying: ""Scotland needs a strong Labour party; Scotland needs a united Labour party. We have been the greatest force for change in our nation's remarkable history. ""The Scottish Labour party will rise again. It will be under someone else's leadership and I am confident about my party's future.""Harriet Harman MP, acting leader of the UK Labour Party, said it would be for Scottish Labour to choose a new leader. She added: ""As a cabinet minister and leader of his party in Scotland, Jim has been a hugely important figure in the Labour Party. He leaves with the best wishes and thanks of our movement.""Labour peer Lord McConnell, a former Scottish first minister, said the party's problems were ""much deeper than one individual and one affiliate"".He said: ""We have a disconnect locally and nationally with wider Scottish society. ""We have a problem with our political positioning in the post devolution age where the party particularly at the UK level has never been comfortable with success in the Scottish parliament and has always tried to see things through a UK prism rather than a Scottish prism.""We need to find a new generation, a new leader, new generation, new ideas, a fresh approach.""In a tweet, Scottish first minister and SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said: ""I wish Jim Murphy all the very best for the future. Leadership is not easy and he deserves credit for standing up for what he believes in.""Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson also reacted on Twitter, saying: ""Jim Murphy announces a managed exit in order to help the party, which is to his credit. But leaves a tough gig for whoever comes next.""The meeting of Scottish Labour's executive was disrupted by protesters who entered the party's headquarters.Police were called and the protesters, who included persistent anti-austerity activists Sean Clerkin and Piers Doughty-Brown, left the building to protest further from the street outside.The protesters were calling for Mr Murphy to remain as leader to ""finish the job of destroying Scottish Labour"".A Police Scotland spokeswoman said officers had been called and found two protestors on the third floor of the building. She added: ""Both left on police arrival. Advice and assistance was given."""
2015-05-03,Labour contenders clash on spending,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32761561,"Prospective Labour leaders have clashed over Labour's record in government in their first public debate in the race to succeed Ed Miliband.Former cabinet ministers including Yvette Cooper and Andy Burnham defended Labour's fiscal record and spending on schools and hospitals.However, candidates from the 2010 intake of MPs argued that the party spent too much while in office.The debate followed Chuka Umunna's withdrawal from the leadership contest.The remaining candidates appeared at the annual conference of the Progress think tank in London.There was agreement that Labour needed to demonstrate economic credibility to regain power, with shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt telling the meeting that the party needed to be ""trusted with public finances and the family finances"".Mr Hunt, who was first elected to Parliament in 2010 when Labour lost power, argued the last Labour government ""spent too much"" and failed to ""leave enough economic headroom to deal with the economic crisis and the recession"".Shadow health minister Liz Kendall said: ""There's absolutely nothing progressive about spending more on debt interest payments than on educating our children.""But shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: ""The Tories have had a triumph of spin over the facts in saying what they said about the economic record of the last Labour government.""The former chief secretary to the Treasury said the deficit did ""grow too large"" in the government's later years but insisted: ""The last Labour government ran more surpluses in its first term than the Tories did in 18 years.""Yvette Cooper, another former chief secretary to the Treasury, said: ""We should never let anybody tell us that it was too many teachers, doctors or nurses that caused Lehman Brothers bank in New York to crash.""Shadow international development secretary Mary Creagh said: ""People have forgotten the economic credibility that the last Labour government had.""She said Labour had built schools and hospitals that were ""treasured in our communities"".Ms Cooper, Mr Burnham, Ms Kendall and Ms Creagh have declared their intention to run for leader, while Mr Hunt told the conference he would make an announcement next week.At the same event, shadow energy secretary Caroline Flint announced she would be running for deputy leader.The Don Valley MP told the Today programme ahead of the debate that Labour lost the election because ""fundamentally the public did not trust us on the economy"".Exeter MP Ben Bradshaw has already announced a bid to be deputy, saying Labour ""must and could win the next election"", but only if it ""broadens its appeal by adopting sensible, centre-left politics which celebrate wealth creation and entrepreneurship"".Former Labour campaign co-ordinator Tom Watson is reported to be crowd-funding a deputy leadership bid, while Walthamstow MP Stella Creasy has said she is ""open to the question"" of running.Barnsley East MP and shadow transport secretary Michael Dugher - a fierce critic of Ed Miliband's election campaign - is to run Mr Burnham's campaign, according to the website LabourList.It is reported that Mr Burnham also has the backing of Labour peer Lord Falconer, who was lord chancellor and justice secretary under Tony Blair and was close to the former PM.Shadow culture secretary Chris Bryant has signalled his backing for Ms Cooper, tweeting that the next leader must be ""someone who's been tried in the fiery furnace of public opinion"".Mr Hunt said on Friday he would be be attending the debate - along with the other four hopefuls - to ""set out my analysis on how we begin to understand what went so wrong and why"".He added: ""We must use this leadership election to ask some very profound questions.""All voices in the party must be heard so that we can have a full and proper assessment as to why the politics of nationalism triumphed in Scotland and huge swathes of England, and how we have allowed the Conservative Party to present a more compelling vision for Britain to so many millions of people.""Speculation still surrounds shadow business secretary Mr Umunna's decision to pull out on Friday, when he said he was not ""comfortable"" with the ""pressure"" of being a candidate.As well as citing extensive pressure and scrutiny Mr Umunna also said he was ruling himself out because of concerns about the impact of the bid on his family.A rising star of the party, Mr Umunna was first elected to Parliament in 2010 - alongside Tristram Hunt and Liz Kendall - before joining the shadow cabinet.Asked about the candidate who might win, Conservative Chancellor George Osborne said: ""The Labour leadership contest has descended into farce.""But it's not actually about personalities. I don't think the Labour Party any more represents the working people of this country who aspire to a better life."""

I'm not suggesting he takes a break from being leader.""Clearly the national executive has the authority, they're the ruling body. ""I'm told that they made a decision. I'm told it was a procedurally correct decision, he is the leader but I think it's important that as leader he takes a break and I think it's important that we work out how these complex questions are answered by a team.""No one person has all the answers. I'm particularly concerned about tone, making sure we get a tone that ensures that the 27 million people who didn't vote for UKIP last week may be persuaded to vote for us in future.""The party has been beset by wrangling since Mr Farage agreed to stay on as leader, days after standing down after failing to get elected in Thanet South.He had pledged before the general election that he would quit the post if he failed to get elected to Parliament.Senior aide Matthew Richardson has left the party, following claims from MEP Patrick O'Flynn that Mr Farage had fallen under the influence of ""inexperienced"" advisers.UKIP has also confirmed the departure of Mr Farage's chief of staff Raheem Kassam.Mr Farage ruled out quitting as leader on BBC's Question Time on Thursday, saying he had ""phenomenal"" support, and has challenged his critics to decide whether they want to stay in the party.In his article, Mr Carswell had said that ""knowing how difficult it is to lead a party makes me admire Nigel Farage all the more"".""I know that I never could,"" he added, stressing that he would find it ""impossible to simultaneously lead UKIP, be the voice of the party in the Commons, represent my Clacton constituents and at the same time be a husband and a dad"".However, he said that ""even leaders need to take a break"", adding: ""Nigel needs to take a break now.""UKIP got nearly four million votes at the election, but returned only one MP - former Conservative Mr Carswell in the Clacton constituency."

Under the plans, ministers could force schools rated as ""requiring improvement"" and missing new government benchmarks to become an academy.Coasting schools have average results which have often flatlined over time.Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, Mrs Morgan said faster action was needed.She said: ""Our big priorities will be to speed up the process for tackling failing schools; extend our academies programme to tackle 'coasting' schools; and deliver on our commitment to open new free schools.""The proposals will be in a new bill due to be introduced in the Queen's Speech. ""First, we will take new powers to step in from the moment that a school is found to be failing,"" Mrs Morgan said.""From day one, regional schools commissioners will be able to bring in new leadership and support from other excellent schools and heads, and we will speed up the process of turning schools into academies to make sure that new expert leadership is found for all schools that need it as quickly as possible.""She said that coasting schools will be put on an immediate notice to improve and could then be taken over and turned into an academy.They will be required to work with a team of ""expert"" head teachers.She said: ""Those that aren't able to demonstrate a clear plan for improvement will be given new leadership - we know this works in turning schools around.""More than 3,300 schools in England are labelled ""requires improvement"", but the plans are unlikely to cover that many schools.Under the current system, secondary schools are considered to be failing, and therefore eligible for intervention, if fewer than 40% of their students score at least five Cs at GCSE, including English and maths, and they do not meet national averages in pupil progress.In primary schools, the threshold for intervention is if fewer than 65% of pupils get Level 4 in reading, writing and maths and a below average number of pupils make the expected amount of progress.It is not yet clear how coasting schools will be deemed in need of intervention.It is understood that a new category will be devised covering schools which are rated as ""requires improvement"" and which fail to meet a new set of standards on improvement."
2015-05-03,Co-op Group to keep political funding,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-32762858,"The Co-operative Group has decided to continue financially supporting the Co-operative Party, which has strong ties to Labour.Members of the group, the UK's biggest mutual organisation, voted on the issue at their annual general meeting.They passed a motion by 48,579 for, to 39,479 against, to approve ""political expenditures"" of up to £1m which support the movement's objectives.Last year the Co-op Group gave £625,000 to the Co-op Party.This figure was down on the sums donated in previous years. The AGM also included a vote on new corporate governance procedures which would mean members having less of a direct say.The Co-operative Group is still recovering from a period of financial mismanagement and some members have recently expressed concerns about how elections to the board are chosen.The banking arm of the group came close to collapse in 2013, bringing the whole group to a £2.5bn annual loss that year. The Co-op Party includes among its members a number of Labour MPs, including shadow chancellor Chris Leslie and Walthamstow MP Stella Creasy. The politicians stand as candidates of both the Co-operative Party and the Labour Party, and the two political movements have strong historical ties. The board asked the members of the Co-operative Group whether they wanted to continue financially supporting the Co-operative Party, or any other party. Allan Leighton, chairman of the Co-op Group, said: ""There's a clear remit from the members to continue to support the Labour Party.""It allows us to now have a conversation with the Co-op Labour Party about what we do next.""There was also a members' motion on the agenda, put forward by those in favour of making political donations of up to £1m a year.The motion to approve political funding ""not to exceed £1m per annum"" was carried by 55.17% to 44.83%.BBC business correspondent Joe Lynam said: ""To meet a £1.5bn hole in its accounts - mostly stemming from its banking division - the Co-op Group has had to sell off parts of its businesses and hand over majority control of its bank to American hedge funds.""It's also in the process of radically changing the way it runs itself into a more corporate structure with less of a direct say by its members.""He said that ""in theory"", each of the 2.8 million Co-op members could vote on a series of motions about the reforms, as well as how its bosses are paid, and retaining the links to the Co-operative party.One of the group's largest independent societies, Midcounties, recently threatened legal action over a shortlist of six candidates for the group's board being reduced to three - the number of positions available - before a member vote.

2015-05-03,Osborne plans July 'stability' Budget,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32761566,"Chancellor George Osborne has said that he will deliver a new Budget on 8 July.He claimed it would have ""a laser-like focus"" on raising productivity and living standards.He said he was making the unusual move of having a second Budget in one year in order to ""deliver on the commitments we have made to working people"".Labour said the chancellor would have to set out ""who is going to pay"" for what it called ""uncosted promises"" in the election campaign.Speaking outside 11 Downing Street, the chancellor gave a broad outline of his plans for the forthcoming Budget but refused to be drawn on the details, including the Conservatives' planned £12bn of welfare cuts.""I don't want to wait to deliver on the commitments we have made to working people,"" he said.""It will continue with the balanced plan we have to deal with our debts, invest in our health service and reform welfare to make work pay.""But there will also be a laser-like focus on making our economy more productive so we raise living standards across our country.""We're going to put Britain into good shape for the long term.""The last Budget was held on 18 March and included tax cuts for first-time house buyers.Writing in the Sun, Mr Osborne admitted it was ""unusual"" to have two Budgets in the same year, but he wanted to turn ""promises made in the election into a reality"".Again, Mr Osborne did not specifically outline how the Conservatives plan to fulfil a pledge to cut £12bn in welfare spending but said he wants to make the welfare system ""fair for the people who pay for it"".He writes: ""We will protect the NHS and give it more funding each and every year, while making savings across Whitehall. ""We'll crack down hard on tax avoidance and aggressive tax planning by the rich - because everyone should pay their fair share.  ""We will always protect the most vulnerable, but we also need a welfare system that's fair to the people who pay for it. If you can work you should be working, so we'll take the next steps in our benefit reforms to make sure that happens.""Second, we've got to go on helping businesses create jobs in Britain, so we move towards full employment. That means facing a hard truth: in Britain we produce about a quarter less for every hour we work than countries like America or Germany. Fixing that long-running productivity weakness is the big challenge for the next five years.""So in the Budget we'll spend less on welfare, and instead invest to create three million more apprenticeships, so that young people can learn a trade, get better jobs and earn more.""After the Budget in March independent forecaster the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said that Mr Osborne needed to spell out exactly how he plans to cut £12bn from welfare spending.Of those £12bn planned cuts, £2bn were outlined ahead of the general election - all the cuts are supposed to be in place by 2017-18.Labour's shadow energy and climate change secretary, Caroline Flint, accused the Tories of making ""a number of uncosted promises"" during the election campaign.She told the BBC: ""It will be interesting to see who is going to pay for those uncosted policies when they bring the Budget in July."""
2015-05-03,Farage should take a break - Carswell,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32761766,"UKIP leader Nigel Farage ""needs to take a break now"", the party's only MP Douglas Carswell has said.Writing in the Times, Mr Carswell said he admired Mr Farage, but questioned his ""ill-advised"" comments about HIV patients, made in a TV leaders' debate.Mr Farage ruled out quitting as leader on BBC's Question Time on Thursday, saying he had ""phenomenal"" support.It follows a bitter internal row within the party, which has seen two of Mr Farage's senior aides resigning.In his article, Mr Carswell said that ""knowing how difficult it is to lead a party makes me admire Nigel Farage all the more"".""I know that I never could,"" he added, stressing that he would find it ""impossible to simultaneously lead UKIP, be the voice of the party in the Commons, represent my Clacton constituents and at the same time be a husband and a dad"".However, he said that ""even leaders need to take a break"", adding: ""Nigel needs to take a break now.""He described Mr Farage as ""inspirational"", saying the party had ""done extraordinarily well"" under his leadership but now needed to ""consider carefully what comes next"".Earlier, Mr Farage challenged his critics to decide whether they wanted him to stay in the party.He said he had ""massive"" support from UKIP MEPs, donors and party members to continue in the role, suggesting one person, whom he did not name, was ""agitating for change"".Addressing the prospect of a future EU referendum, Mr Carswell said: ""All of us UKIP supporters should ask one question; Is what I'm doing at this moment making an 'out' vote more likely? If it isn't, stop it and do something else.""He also criticised Mr Farage's comments about HIV patients during the TV leaders' debate last month.While debating about the NHS, Mr Farage said: ""You can come into Britain from anywhere in the world and get diagnosed with HIV and get the retro-viral drugs that cost up to £25,000 per year per patient.""Mr Carswell wrote: ""By all means we should highlight the problem of health tourism. But we need to admit that using the example of HIV patients to make the point was ill-advised.""He said the party needed to strike ""the right tone"" and added: ""UKIP has been at its most persuasive when we have been most optimistic.""Anger is never a great way to motivate people - at least not for very long.""The party has been beset by wrangling since Mr Farage agreed to stay on as leader, days after standing down after failing to get elected in Thanet South.He had pledged before the general election that he would quit the post if he failed to get elected to Parliament.Matthew Richardson has left the party, following claims from MEP Patrick O'Flynn that Mr Farage had fallen under the influence of ""inexperienced"" advisers. UKIP has also confirmed the departure of Mr Farage's chief of staff Raheem Kassam.UKIP got nearly four million votes at the election, but returned only one MP - former Conservative Mr Carswell in the Clacton constituency."

They absolutely loved how he helped them and he was a highly-regarded local MP,"" Mr Bone said.""He stood up for what was right rather than what the party line was. In those days - the John Major years - it was much more difficult to stand up against the party machine. He had strong views on Europe.""Sir Peter started his career as an insurance broker, joining the Wycombe Young Conservatives in 1949 and the Oxford University Conservative Association in 1951.He went on to become a Conservative councillor on Buckinghamshire County Council between 1961 and 1967.Wellingborough mayor-elect Barry Graves also paid tribute to Sir Peter, remembering him as a ""very strong constituency MP"".""I remember going out and canvassing with him and he would go everywhere. He knew the area and the people. He was very much a man of the local constituency.""He was ""a very approachable man"", Mr Graves added.Sir Peter was knighted in 1994. "

2015-05-03,PM will 'look at' powers proposals,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32746049,"David Cameron has said he would ""look at"" any proposals for further powers for Scotland but wants to get the Smith Commission plans implemented first.The prime minister was speaking after meeting Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon in Edinburgh.Mr Cameron said he made a ""commitment"" to include a devolution bill in the Queen's Speech later this month.Ms Sturgeon argued the Smith Commission proposals were ""a good starting point"" but did not go far enough.The prime minister has pledged to include a bill on devolution in this month's Queen's Speech which would be based on the cross-party Smith Commission agreement. The Smith proposals included giving Holyrood the power to set income tax rates and bands, as well as control over a share of VAT and some welfare benefits. But Ms Sturgeon's SNP also wants the Scottish Parliament to be given powers over business taxes, employment law, the minimum wage and additional powers over welfare.Speaking after meeting Ms Sturgeon, Mr Cameron told the BBC: ""Let's make sure Smith is implemented in full. I'm going to keep the commitment I made to the people of Scotland. Let's get that done first because it does create a really strong Scottish Parliament.""He added: ""Of course, if people want to make future proposals I'll look at them.""The prime minister again said he did not support full fiscal autonomy for Scotland - the responsibility for all areas of tax and spending except defence and foreign affairs - stating that it would mean £7bn of cuts or extra tax-raising.What Nicola Sturgeon is trying to say is she has a mandate. She has 56 out of the 59 MPs elected in Scotland and she won 50% of the vote - unprecedented here in Scotland.She says that gives her leverage to push David Cameron. David Cameron says he wants to keep the nation together.The language coming out of Westminster last week was very much a cordial one. 'We will listen'.Nicola Sturgeon has warned him that if he doesn't listen, then the people of Scotland will judge him accordingly.Ms  Sturgeon described the hour-long talks at her official residence at Bute House as ""constructive and business-like"". She said Mr Cameron had made a ""commitment"" that the Smith proposals would be implemented ""as agreed"".""But secondly the prime minister agreed that he would look at proposals that we would now send to suggest the areas we can go beyond Smith,"" Ms Sturgeon said.""There was no agreement in terms of the substance of that but we will submit those proposals, the prime minister has said they will consider them and there will be a meeting to look at how we take that further forward.""Referring to her party's success in last week's general election, which saw the SNP win 56 out of 59 Scottish seats, Ms Sturgeon said: ""People in Scotland have now voted fairly convincingly for the SNP and sent a message that we want the Smith Commission proposals to go further and be built on.""The ball is in his court but I'm going into this in good faith.""She added: ""David Cameron and I are a world apart politically but, where we can, I'm determined to do business in the interests of the people of Scotland and across the UK.""She said she would have a ""constructive and business-like"" relationship with the prime minister. The two leaders shook hands on the front steps of Bute House as Mr Cameron arrived. Mr Cameron left the building shortly before 11:00, almost an hour after he had arrived.The two sides agreed to hold more regular discussions in the future, possibly quarterly. "

I'm human, the rest of my life is more important to me than politics.""The shadow business secretary has been distressed by the degree of scrutiny he, his family and his girlfriend have come under since he declared his intention to stand for the labour leadership.I am told that this includes reporters waiting outside the houses of relatives late at night.Friends of Mr Umunna deny that he is nervous of not getting the support of enough MPs to run for the leadership; they point out that he already has half the necessary names and that there are some weeks to go.The shadow business secretary now wants to play a leading role in arguing that Britain should stay in the EU and does not rule out seeking the leadership in the future.He said he thought he had understood ""the scrutiny and attention a leadership contest would bring"", but added: ""However, since the night of our defeat last week I have been subject to the added level of pressure that comes with being a leadership candidate.""The shadow business secretary said he had wondered if it was too soon for him to stand for the leadership, and ""I fear it was."" He also cited concerns about the impact on ""the rest of one's life"" and those close to him.""Consequently, after further reflection, I am withdrawing my candidacy,"" he said.Mr Umunna said he would continue to serve as shadow business secretary and hoped to ""play a leading role"" in Labour's campaign to keep the UK in the EU during the forthcoming in/out referendum.Commenting on the news, Labour former culture secretary Ben Bradshaw - who is expected to run for deputy leader - said Mr Umunna was a ""terrible loss"" to the field.He told the BBC's Daily Politics the Streatham MP had been the candidate the Conservative Party ""feared the most"".""And if it's the result of pressure on an extended family or an extended group of friends, I think that's a very sad reflection on our political culture,"" he said.Chuka Umunna feels ""liberated"", he told me, by his decision to quit the Labour leadership race.He hopes to be given a good role (shadow chancellor, I wonder?) by whoever becomes Labour leader. And I expect he'll become very high profile in the campaign to keep Britain in Europe, which is increasingly looking like it will be next May.He'll endorse a candidate in the next four weeks before nominations close. It will be very interesting to see who he piles in behind.Read more from Allegra (see post 13.23).Former Labour leader Lord Kinnock said he thought Mr Umunna had made the right decision.He said: ""If he felt in his soul that he wasn't prepared to subject himself - and more importantly his family - to the kind of attention which is fairly typical, sadly, these days, he has done absolutely the right thing.""There is no point at all in inflicting avoidable, unnecessary misery on those you love most.""Leadership contender Mary Creagh said she had ""huge respect"" for Mr Umunna, telling BBC Radio 4's World at One programme it took ""courage"" to withdraw from the leadership race.Mr Umunna was ""a big beast"" and would play a ""big role"" in the future of the Labour Party, she added.Yvette Cooper, Andy Burnham, Liz Kendall and Mary Creagh have already thrown their hats into the ring for Labour's top job while a number of other potential candidates, including Dan Jarvis, Alan Johnson and David Lammy, have ruled themselves out. Candidates must secure nominations from 34 colleagues - 15% of the party's MPs - by 15 June to make it on to ballot papers, which will be sent to members in August ahead of the leader's election a month later."

However, Mr Justice Stuart Smith at Southwark Crown Court said there was a ""very strong likelihood"" a custodial sentence would follow.The jury heard how Mote submitted numerous false expenses claims for payment for work that organisations had allegedly carried out on his behalf.Mote claimed the money was to pay whistleblowers in cash through third parties. He also said he had been ""targeted for being an anti-EU MEP.""During his time an MEP he also made £250,000 legitimate expenses claims.No date has been set for the sentencing."

2015-05-03,Round-up: BBC experts' analysis,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/election-2015-32650417,"The political future of the United Kingdom has become clearer after the results of the general election emerged around the country.David Cameron says he hopes to govern for all of the UK after the Conservatives took 331 seats - enough to form a slender majority in the Commons.Labour has been all but wiped out by the SNP in Scotland and suffered a disappointing set of results elsewhere, while the Lib Dems are left with just eight MPs after many party heavyweights such as Vince Cable and Danny Alexander lost their seats.So with battles won and lost and the fall-out and celebrations beginning, BBC correspondents examine the implications and challenges that lie ahead for the new government - and for those whose political careers have been ended by voters.No pollster, no pundit, no political leader saw it coming - not even David Cameron himself.Governing parties don't gain seats. Parties that have implemented painful cuts and are promising more certainly don't. Until that is the Conservative Party did - achieving what had seemed to be Mission Impossible - a Tory majority.Until that is David Cameron's personal triumph which triggered the near simultaneous resignation of his three principle opponents - Messrs Miliband, Clegg and Farage.They did so in part because they helped to crush their partners in coalition these last five years - reducing the Liberal Democrat parliamentary party to a size when it can fit into two London taxis and still have two seats to spare.In part because the extraordinary tidal wave of support for the SNP swept dozens of once safe Labour seats away.In part because Nigel Farage persuaded millions to vote for him but secured just one seat - not, though, the one he was standing in.Read more from Nick Robinson hereThe question uppermost in the prime minister's mind as he assembles his new government is how to keep the kingdom united.""Above all I want to bring our country together,"" he revealed after the result, ""to reclaim a mantle we should never have lost - the mantle of one nation, one United Kingdom"".Looking at the political landscape from Land's End today is very different to the view from John O'Groats.A sea of Conservative and Unionist blue dominates the scene across much of England, while a field of SNP nationalist yellow stretches to the horizon and beyond from the north.David Cameron's greatest challenge is to prevent the union he supports being torn apart by mutual resentment - resentment from Scotland at a Westminster government dominated by English Tories, and resentment from England at the preferential treatment people think is being given to the Scots.Those who assumed the future of the Union had been safeguarded by the Scottish referendum must think again.Read more from Mark Easton hereOne thing is rock-solid true: the Conservatives who worked on this campaign are as surprised by the result as the pollsters, pundits, politicians and general population.Maybe they shouldn't be - the economy is in good shape and the Conservatives had incumbency advantage.But when I travelled back from the prime minister's last rally with a group of exhausted Conservative campaign officials it was clear that 290 seats was a hoped-for target.No-one talked about anything over 300 seats, and no-one even mentioned an overall majority.So what special sauce pushed David Cameron into No 10 with a Commons majority?Mr Cameron had two simple messages in the campaign and he rarely veered away from them; the first - the economy is in good shape and the recovery is threatened by Labour. And the second - the SNP would hold a Labour-led government to ransom.Read more from Jonny Dymond hereBrian Taylor, BBC political editor, ScotlandOf all the comments on the overnight apocalypse, undoubtedly the most straightforward came from a defeated Scottish Labour MP.Since there were quite a few of them, let me narrow the focus a little. Come on down, Tom Harris.Mr Harris had plainly anticipated defeat. Nonetheless, he looked suitably lugubrious as his fate was confirmed.Why, he was asked eagerly, had Labour lost? ""Because we did not win enough votes.""Psephologically, it is perfect. Complete in itself. Psychologically, it sums up Labour's gloom without descending into subsidiary matters such as leadership, strategy and the rest. As a forward-thinking strategy, it is ideal. Win more votes. Simple.Read more from Brian Taylor hereThis has been an election which may have more profound consequences than almost any in living memory.We now face a generational decision about our future in Europe, with an EU referendum in two years' time almost certain.There will also be serious questions about the future of the Union, following an SNP landslide that has turned Scotland into a virtual one-party state.David Cameron's victory also represents a colossal achievement.Only once before in recent history has an incumbent government increased its majority - and that was Mrs Thatcher in her prime in the 1980s.It is also a significant personal victory for Mr Cameron and a rebuff for those in his party who had become increasingly sceptical about his ability to win.But while it may represent a defeat for those Tories who saw this election as a potential opportunity to rid themselves of David Cameron, he must now govern with a wafer-thin majority.For the SNP, their stunning victory can only increase the pressure on Nicola Sturgeon to include a commitment to a second independence referendum in her party's manifesto for next year's Scottish elections.It is an election which has not just defied all the predictions of the pollsters and pundits - but which may yet prompt the most fundamental re-casting of British politics for a generation.Read more from Norman Smith hereAfter an extraordinary night, some brief conclusions:Read more from James Landale hereIs this the end of the union?That is the question many people will be asking this morning after the party which has fought for Scottish independence for 80 years swept to victory.The answer from the jubilant Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon is a firm ""No"".She insists that her MPs will speak for all of Scotland, not just for the 45% who voted for the country to leave the United Kingdom last September.In the closing hours of the most extraordinary election campaign which anyone in Scotland can remember, Ms Sturgeon turned to talk of ""legitimacy.""That will be her watchword in the coming days as she argues that the prime minister cannot ignore the democratic will of the Scottish people.Politically, Scotland and England this morning look and feel like very different countries.Read more from James Cook hereAfter weeks of chatter about an election too close to call, it wasn't that close at all.David Cameron will be continuing as our prime minister.So, what is all this likely to mean?A referendum on whether the UK stays in, or leaves, the European Union, within the next two-and-a-half years.A race to be the next leader of the Labour Party.A race to be the next leader of the Liberal Democrats.And a huge new presence of Scottish National Party MPs at Westminster.And so here's another thing we know for certain this morning: Politics ain't going to be boring any time soon.Read more from Chris Mason hereFor Labour the story of their terrible night is rapidly turning into the search for a new leader. So who will that be?Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, is almost certain to run.  Even before this election, both he and another almost inevitable candidate, Chuka Umunna, had raised eyebrows inside the party at the work they had put in, preparing the ground with members and the unions for potential bids.Yvette Cooper, before the election, was still thought not to have made up her mind over whether to run. That decision has been made perhaps a little easier as her husband, Ed Balls, has lost his seat.She is certainly potentially in the frame, along with two lesser known names - Liz Kendall and Dan Jarvis - two MPs who were only elected in 2010 for the first time. This could be their moment. But whoever is in the job, they face a monumental task.Read Laura Kuenssberg's Twitter hereSterling is up (the most for seven years against the euro), share prices are up (especially bank shares like Lloyds and RBS, and energy shares such as Centrica), government bond prices are up.To state the obvious, investors love the Tories' general election victory.There are a few reasons.One (no surprise here) is that Labour's threat of breaking up banks and imposing energy price caps has been lifted.Second is that investors have been discounting days and weeks of wrangling after polling day over who would form the government - and so they are semi-euphoric that we already know who's in charge.Third, many investors tend to be economically conservative and instinctively Conservative.But although the City may be a bit drunk on the result, its pleasure in Ed Miliband's and Ed Balls' humiliation may be making it a bit blind - perhaps dangerously so - to some bumps in the economic road ahead.Read more from Robert Peston hereNigel Farage dreamed of holding the balance of power, but in the end his UKIP party is now worse off than when it came into the election.At the seventh time of asking he was rejected - this time by the people of Thanet South. It was a similar story in Rochester and Strood where Mark Reckless, who sensationally defected from the Tories last year, was also sent packing.In seats on UKIP's target list, like Thurrock in Essex, the party failed to make gains. In Grimsby - where Mr Farage went twice in the last six weeks - they came third.UKIP got around four million votes - with especially strong showings in north-east and south-east England - but it's ended up with just one MP, and a vacancy at the top. This has led to UKIP attacking the current system of choosing MPs, which it's described as ""busted"" and ""dysfunctional"".In one sense, this campaign was a complete failure and it's left an aftermath of angry voters, and others wondering if the UKIP bubble has burst.Read Robin Brant's Twitter hereI monitored 91 GB-wide voting intention polls during the 2015 election campaign and found nothing in them to prepare me for the final outcome.The good news for the pollsters was that their share for the Lib Dems was pretty close, as were the shares for UKIP, the Greens and the catch-all category of Others.The bad news for the polling industry was that the crucial shares for Conservative and Labour were the ones where they came most adrift.When all the qualifications of margins of error are allowed, there did appear to be a systematic overstatement of the Labour share and an equally systematic understatement of the Conservative one.It is for the pollsters to decide whether to conduct a review of their performance but I trust they will avoid the initial knee-jerk reaction of the immediate aftermath of the 1992 polls debacle.This general election performance follows the performance of the polls in the 2014 Scottish referendum where the choice was simply binary and yet all the polls were out by between 4-6%.Something is wrong. A lot of us would like to know what it is.Read more from David Cowling hereThe words ""political earthquake"" have been translated into numerous European languages, making front page news across the continent.While Britons now examine the domestic minutiae of the election result, here in mainland Europe the vote means one thing: a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU.

""We now face a generational decision about our future in Europe, with an EU referendum in two years time almost certain.

David Cameron's victory also represents a colossal achievement.""James Landale, deputy political editor: ""After an extraordinary night, some brief conclusions: With a small majority or slight minority for David Cameron, Tory MPs will be much empowered. As such, Mr Cameron will need support from other parties to get business through.

2015-05-03,A history of political plots,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32749971,"Nigel Farage has apparently seen off a challenge to his leadership of UKIP - a move described by his former election strategist as a ""coup"". He's not the only party leader to face an attempted ousting. But can you recover from such a revolt?In 2006, the Labour prime minister was the target of what became known as the ""curry house conspiracy"" - a coup to remove him and install his chancellor, Gordon Brown, as prime minister.It would lead to several of the plotters' resignations - but not Mr Blair's. However, it was successful to a degree in that it forced the party leader into naming a departure date.The move against him was reportedly masterminded by Tom Watson, a defence minister at the time, who was also rumoured to have had a secret meeting with Mr Brown on the eve of the revolt.Apparently, Mr Watson and three fellow West Midlands MPs - Sion Simon, David Wright (both ministerial aides) and Khalid Mahmood - met over a biryani at a Wolverhampton curry house to discuss the PM's future, before dispatching a missive calling for him to quit.The letter - which attracted the support of a number of normally loyal Labour MPs - was leaked to the press, and ultimately resulted in Mr Watson's resignation.In his parting letter, the West Bromwich East MP took a shot at the prime minister, who he said should step down in the interests of party and country.Mr Blair denounced his actions and branded the former minister ""disloyal, discourteous and wrong"", saying he would have sacked him if he had not resigned.But Mr Watson's departure was swiftly followed by the resignations of six other junior members of government - who had also signed the rebel letter - in protest at the prime minister's refusal to say when he would step down as Labour leader.The whole affair resulted in Mr Blair announcing his intention to step aside within 12 months - which he duly did, on 27 June 2007.But it did nothing to quash internal dissent and speculation in the party over the future leadership of the party.Labour prime minister Gordon Brown found his leadership under threat in 2009 after one of his cabinet ministers dramatically quit the government and called for him to resign.Work and Pensions Secretary James Purnell - a former aide to Tony Blair - resigned from his post after the polls closed in the local and European elections, in which Labour was forecast to do badly.Explaining his decision to quit, Mr Purnell said the prime minister made a Conservative victory ""more, not less, likely"".It was Mr Brown's first direct challenge from a cabinet minister - but it would not topple the Labour leader as senior members of government refused to follow Mr Purnell's lead.Mr Brown was safe for the time being. But several months later, in January 2010, a fresh leadership challenge was mounted by two senior former Labour cabinet ministers.Geoff Hoon and Patricia Hewitt wrote to all Labour MPs, saying the party was ""deeply divided"" over Mr Brown's leadership and that the best way to resolve the issue was by way of secret ballot.They insisted it was not an ""attempted coup"" but a necessary step to resolve divisions within the party.But the duo could only muster the public support of a handful of backbenchers long-opposed to Mr Brown, with the majority of the party's MPs less than impressed by the move, which came just weeks before the general election.As the day wore on, a succession of cabinet ministers came out to back the PM, suggesting there was little momentum behind the plot - although it was noted that several were not exactly gushing in their support of Mr Brown.As history tells us, neither leadership challenge bore fruit but they reflected the internal doubts and divisions over Mr Brown at the helm.As leadership toppling attempts go, this one in 2014 was regarded as a particularly ""botched"" and ""shambolic coup"". Indeed, former Lib Dem leader Lord (Paddy) Ashdown described the move as a ""plot of deep malice"".Its instigator, Lord (Matthew) Oakeshott - a close ally of the-then Business Secretary Vince Cable - tried to unseat Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg.The peer was found to have commissioned secret polls suggesting the party would do better at the 2015 general election without Mr Clegg in the driving seat.The man Lord Oakeshott had long had in mind to take Mr Clegg's place - Mr Cable, who was on government business in China at the time - was forced to publicly condemn his friend's actions and state his backing for Mr Clegg.But Lord Oakeshott said the business secretary had in fact known about his polls and their findings.Nevertheless, the peer - who was denounced by the Lib Dem leadership for spending money that could have been spent on campaigning - quit the party, and issued a warning shot on his way out about the Lib Dems' future prospects.Mr Cable largely emerged unscathed but he faced questions about his loyalty to the leader. Although the two sought to put paid to reports of a rift with a (painfully awkward, 'nothing to see here, folks') stage-managed pint in a pub.Although the revolt failed, and Mr Clegg remained at the helm, the Lib Dems did go on to suffer a trouncing at the general election, losing nearly 50 of its MPs - one of them, Mr Cable himself - prompting his leader to quit.The Conservatives have a reputation for being more ruthless than their party rivals when it comes to getting rid of leaders they sense are no longer effectual.But, in 1995, Prime Minister John Major - tired of persistent rumours of a leadership challenge - decided to take the bull by the horns and trigger a surprise leadership election to silence his detractors.His own backbenchers had questioned Mr Major's ability to unite and lead the party, which was deeply divided over Europe.So ""put up or shut up"", he told them as he tendered his resignation as Conservative Party leader but not prime minister.But then stepped forward eurosceptic MP John Redwood, who resigned from the cabinet in order to contest Mr Major's leadership.This was unexpected by many, as the PM had said there had been assurances from his cabinet that none would stand against him.But Mr Major went on to win the ensuing election with a comfortable defeat over his challenger, who was not included in the PM's consequent cabinet reshuffle.No further contested leadership election took place until after the Conservatives' defeat at the 1997 general election, paving the way for William Hague to take over the running of the party.Not all attempts to oust a party leader end in failure: as Margaret Thatcher found out to her peril.With three electoral victories under her belt, the Conservative prime minister's downfall would come at the hands of her own party - not the voters.It was on 1 November 1990 when Geoffrey (now Lord) Howe - one of Mrs Thatcher's longest-serving ministers - resigned over differences with the party leader over Europe.In his now infamous speech on the floor of the House of Commons, he attacked the PM's policies and leadership style, comparing being one of her cabinet ministers to opening the batting at cricket only to find his bat had been ""broken... by the team captain"".It sparked the beginning of the end of the 11-year Thatcher reign.Michael (now Lord) Heseltine seized on the opportunity to challenge the prime minister in the ensuing leadership contest, from which she would eventually withdraw and John Major emerge as her successor. Reflecting on the revolt and its implications on the Conservative Party, Baroness Thatcher's biographer Charles Moore wrote: ""Because the coup was unjustified, and so trust broke down, the politics of the next 15 years were those of civil war."""
2015-05-03,Election swings and roundabouts,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-32741924,"If election manifesto claims are all about smoke and mirrors, should we now add swings and roundabouts to the political metaphor?There's an intriguing aspect to the general election results in the Midlands that puzzled me.It's the striking contrast in the swings between Labour and the Conservatives.David Cameron and his campaign strategists knew they were home and dry when Nuneaton was the first Midlands marginal to declare.It was not only a Tory hold but a swing to the Conservatives from Labour of 3%.I was in the Nottingham suburb of Beeston awaiting the result of the Broxtowe count. Would its high profile Conservative MP Anna Soubry survive a red surge?Nuneaton set the pattern. Across the Midlands, both east and west, there was a uniform swing of between three and four per cent to the Tories - Warwickshire North 3%, Amber Valley 4%, Derbyshire South 4% and Sherwood 4%. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan topped the Tory swingometer in the Midlands marginals with 5% in Loughborough.Yet in the big cities, it was a very different story. The swing went to Labour.So in Nottingham East they enjoyed a 6% swing, Nottingham South 5.8%, Leicester South 7.3%, Leicester West 5%, Birmingham Hall Green 12%, Birmingham Hodge Hill 8%.If swings to Labour on this scale had gone beyond the city ring road roundabouts and into the suburbs, Ed Miliband would have become prime minister by now.In confidence, one senior Labour insider in Nottingham told me its success in the city wards was down to organisation, experience and its teams of activists.""We won the ground war. If Nottingham's city boundaries were extended into Sherwood and Broxtowe, we would have won those constituencies as well,"" he told me.Labour leadership candidate, Leicester West's Liz Kendall has identified her party's problem beyond the ring road roundabout.It's about reaching out to Middle England.""We need to show people that we understand their aspirations and ambitions for the future,"" she told the Sunday Times.The problem for Labour was that Middle England was not interested in what the party offered…and still isn't. The Cameron brand worked its magic in those Midlands marginals... it'll take something or someone special to break up that ballot box relationship."
2015-05-03,Royal 'lobbying',https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32740154,"Prince Charles sent 27 letters to then Prime Minister Tony Blair and members of his government between September 2004 and March 2005, ""despite the Freedom of Information Act!"" as the prince joked in one.But did his suggestions and concerns have any bearing on the behaviour of Mr Blair's government?The request: Prince Charles expresses his worries over an EU directive on complementary medicines ""which is… effectively outlawing the use of certain herbal extracts"".  Mr Blair replied, offering moral support and practical help. He agreed that ""the implementation as it is currently planned is crazy"" and set out an action plan that included delaying implementation for all existing products to 2011. What happened: Herbal products were not required to be authorised until 2011, just as Mr Blair had promised. Prince Charles continues to sell his own brand of complementary products, Duchy Herbals, through Boots and Waitrose. The request: Writing to Mr Blair, the prince expresses a ""growing sense of anxiety"" that the Hill Farming Allowance, which supports farmers working on Britain's uplands, could be scrapped. In his reply, the prime minister said he understood that the Hill Farm Allowance would continue until 2007. What happened: The allowance lasted until the end of Labour's tenure in 2010, when it was abolished.The request: Just 18 months after the US-led invasion of Iraq, Prince Charles raised the issue of poor performance of Lynx helicopters in high temperatures, saying: ""I fear that this is just one more example of where our Armed Forces are being asked to do an extremely challenging job (particularly in Iraq) without the necessary resources.""Mr Blair replied: ""On the subject of the Lynx helicopter, the limitations of the existing platform, particularly in the extremely challenging environment within Iraq, are well recognised by the Ministry of Defence."" He added that replacement of the helicopters would be a priority. What happened: Mr Blair's comments go much further than what he was saying about the subject at the time. In the event, though, the fleet was not fully upgraded until 2011.The request: Prince Charles lamented that the government's TB prevention plans might not ""include a commitment to deal with the badger problem in the immediate future"" and pushed strongly for a cull, saying: ""All I can say is that I do urge you to look again at introducing a proper cull of badgers where it is necessary.""Mr Blair sympathised, saying he could ""personally see the case for culling badgers"". However, he was unwilling to commit to a cull.  What happened: Culling trials were conducted from 1998-2005. The final results, published in 2008, said that the badger cull could ""make no meaningful contribution"" to curbing bovine TB. It wasn't until 2013 that a full culling programme began in two pilot areas. These ended with the conclusion that the pilots had been neither humane nor effective at curbing the spread of TB.The request: Then Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell wrote to Prince Charles to say she had decided to give parts of the historic Smithfield meat market Grade II listed status, and was trying to persuade deputy prime minister John Prescott to ""call in"" the planning application to prevent demolition of other parts of the site. She had been swayed by evidence provided by Sir Neil Cossons, who was English Heritage chair at the time, after he had been asked by the prince to add his support. Prince Charles replied that he was ""extremely glad to read of your appreciation of the value of this group of buildings"". According to the Guardian, market workers desperate to see the redevelopment of the site invited the prince to meet them to discuss it, but his office said he was ""unlikely to accept as he did not want to interfere in the planning process"".What happened: Smithfield market is still the subject of planning battles a decade on. Successive planning applications have been refused by ministers. Last year then Communities Secretary Eric Pickles rejected plans for an office development on the site, stating that ""the extent of damage that the application would cause to the important heritage assets at Smithfield runs entirely counter to national and policy objectives intended to protect such assets from harm"".In March, the Museum of London announced a move from its current Barbican site to the Smithfield market building."
2015-05-03,Election fallout,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32703139,"""Some of those gimmicks - that tombstone, whatever idiot thought that up I do not know!""I was talking to the former Mayor of Crawley in Sussex, John Mortimer, in the town's Labour Supporters Club about the vexed question of what went wrong, and where Labour should go next. This seat is one of those southern seats Labour hoped to take, but failed.I hear a whole range of views in the club.""They didn't give nothing to depend on, they should be clear, and a little bit more down to Earth."" ""Good party, wrong leader, they don't look after business enough.""Councillor John Stanley tells me: ""I think in a way we did go too left, but now we can go a bit centre-left, or centre, depending who the new leader is.""The former mayor sums up the mood on the doorstep: ""Whatever we told them, they didn't believe us.""  Expect to hear all those views, and more, in the coming leadership contest. Step back from the angst of supporters, and it may not be that hard to see why Labour failed.  An economic recovery, hailed by independent organisations as the result of government policy, undid a party that had loudly proclaimed for five years that the coalition's policies would lead to economic disaster. Combine that with an uncharismatic and uninspirational leader, then you might argue no further debate is necessary.Fat chance of that. Defeat breeds resentment, and this one has opened up old divisions.  A chorus of Blairties, led by the man himself, has declared that Ed's problem was ignoring those with aspiration and ambition, failing to appeal to those running business. Incidentally, I've been ticked off by the perspicacious editor of the New Statesman, Jason Cowley, for using the ""unhelpful"" term ""Blairites"".I can't think of another description that fits Tony, Lord Mandelson, Lord Adonis and David Miliband quite so well. But call them what you will, the message was clear - Ed was too left wing, Labour should move back to the centre, or, if you like, to the right.Reading Mr Blair's pithy analysis, listening to Lord Mandelson's gripping and savage eloquence, describing a party sent out to shout: ""We love the poor and hate the rich,"" and so ignoring the middle, and you realise strong emotions are in play.But back to the future may not be sufficient. Of course elections are won on the centre ground. But grandees grinding axes, affronted by the failure of boys who used to make their tea, may be creating so much noise that they can't hear more insistent sounds.  For there are several elephants trumpeting loudly as they cram into the small space of the shadow cabinet room. Imagine these beasts are as gaily decorated as Berlin buddy bears. One is decked out in red, another in imperial purple bunting, and another, a mammoth, strong tusked and ice rimmed, painted yellow with tartan trimmings.Take the last first. The Scottish wipeout is Labour's biggest problem. Fail to solve it, and Labour can forget ever having a comfortable majority again. It is hard to argue Labour were wiped out in Scotland because the SNP outflanked them to the right with their appeal to the business community and the ambitious and aspirational. But it is true the SNP drew in to people from left, right and centre, just as the modernisers say Labour should. It was the politics of economic self-interest, but cast in a very different light. Tribally sneering at ""the reactionary ideology of nationalism"" as Mr Blair does, will not reach the central belt of Scotland, the middle ground of  Midlothian.What about that purple pachyderm?  In Crawley - in fact in seat after seat - there is a similar pattern.  Labour did, in fact, often increase the size of their vote. So did the Conservatives, usually by a bit more. But the real dynamic was the total collapse of the Lib Dems and the dramatic rise of UKIP. The increase in votes for Nigel Farage's party wasn't translated into parliamentary seats, but, although it is early days in terms of research, it probably hurt Labour a lot. If we believe - and I do - Matthew Goodwin and Rob Ford, authors of Revolt on the Right, these voters are often former Labour supporters - older, less educated, those left behind on the tides of  globalisation, stranded on the shores of post-industrialisation. They may have had too many disappointments to feel much ambition or aspiration. They are a challenge for Labour, and any new leader will spend a good deal of time thinking how to deal with the concerns of Europe and immigration.Whether to share their fears, or confront them will be a big decision.Which brings us to Red Nellie. Those members who still proudly call themselves socialist. This is not about Old Labour - they are more likely to be baristas or barristers than boilermakers. It is easy as an outsider, as a journalist, to treat politics as an intellectual game about how best to win power - but many people, particularly the foot soldiers, particularly after the death of  purely tribal loyalties, are in it because they passionately believe in winning  power to do something specific.Many of them are suspicious of the later incarnations of New Labour, not because it reached an accommodation with wealth and business, but because it seemed to worship at the same altar, to regard the party's core beliefs in redistribution and equality as childish fantasies from a past age.Perhaps to Mr Blair, they are the problem, people who may equate ""ambition"" with greed. They might point out that a man who claims to be worth ""only"" £20m may find it harder than most to squeeze through the eye of a needle to understand their point of view. Most successful Labour leaders will confront the left at some point, but the concerns of this group go to the existential question ""What is the party for?""This is not a polemic - not an argument about what should be done, but a reflection on the complex conundrums that will face any new Labour leader, the tearing apart of the old alliance that made up a Labour majority, and so the political need to satisfy groups with very different, indeed, contradictory demands. But looking for a Social Democratic universal theory of everything may be missing the point. What the party desperately wants is a leader who can pull the disparate threads together and articulate them as common purpose. Whether she or he exists is another matter.Much more on that in the coming months."
2015-05-03,'Take us with you',https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-32736153,"Thousands of people in the north of England have been using the hashtag ""take us with you Scotland"" to express their upset about the result of last week's general election, and Scottish nationalists are welcoming this English minority with open arms. Last Thursday's general election was a rough one for the Labour Party in its traditional stronghold in the north of England. But further to the north, the left-leaning Scottish National Party won nearly every seat it contested. That political contrast has made some left-wing voters in places like Manchester, Leeds and Sheffield look fondly on their neighbours. Since last Thursday's election in Britain the phrase ""take us with you Scotland"" has been used more than 24,000 times. ""Genuinely beginning to wonder if the North of England becoming a part of Scotland would be better for us, I really am,"" tweeted Aaron Miller from Yorkshire. Some cracked jokes under the tag after the North West Motorway Police account, which gives traffic updates, announced that they had ""picked up a pedestrian on the M62 who was trying to walk to Scotland.""After an initial spike of jokes over the weekend, the hashtag really took off when users start to mobilise in support of around a year-old petition on the campaigning site Change.org. The petition calls for the north of England to secede from the rest of the country and join up with Scotland, and more than 12,000 people have signed it.Its creator, a Sheffield resident who calls himself ""Stu Dent"", set it up to coincide with last year's Scottish independence referendum, and he also created a map imagining the boundary of a ""Scotland plus the north"" country.Stu Dent runs the Twitter account Hunters Bar, named after an area of southwest Sheffield which is very popular with - you guessed it - students. Despite the account having thousands of followers on Twitter, when the map was first posted last year, the image was shared only about 100 times - however, in the past week it's been retweeted by thousands. Stu Dent told BBC Trending that he was surprised at how popular his idea has become. ""In hindsight, perhaps I shouldn't have been,"" he said. ""There is a huge frustration in parts of the UK about the things that have happened since 2010.""""I think people need a place to go where they can say 'not in my name!

2015-05-03,What Britain wants from Europe,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32695399,"David Cameron says he has a mandate to pursue EU reform following the Conservatives' general election victory. The PM, who will be hoping his majority government will give him extra leverage in Brussels, wants to renegotiate the terms of the UK's membership ahead of a referendum by the end of 2017. He has said he will campaign for Britain to remain in the EU if he gets the reforms he wants.Mr Cameron has said he does not want to reveal full details of his negotiating hand but he has given a broad indication, in a series of speeches and newspaper articles, of his priorities when he goes into talks with other EU leaders.These are: The prime minister has said Britain would resist any move towards a European Army and that he wants to free British police forces from EU interference. He has also ruled out Britain joining the euro.But he has placed less emphasis in recent years on demanding changes to EU social policy, such as the maximum 48-hour working week, agency workers, maternity leave and non-discrimination rules.The official UK government position is that a referendum will be held by the end of 2017 but Downing Street sources have said: ""If we can do it earlier we will.""There is speculation David Cameron is planning to hold the vote in 2016 to avoid a clash with French and German elections in 2017.The prime minister wants treaty change but even if the referendum was held in 2017 there may not be enough time to legally incorporate any reforms into a treaty and it would have to be done at a later stage.An early referendum would anger Eurosceptics who believe it would not allow enough time to make the case for exit or negotiate any meaningful concessions.""A rushed process would severely undermine the chances to secure a significant deal that both British business and voters could support and would waste the opportunity of a lifetime,"" Matthew Elliott, chief executive of Business for Britain told Breitbart London.The question is always crucial in any referendum and there is already a debate about what it should be. The Draft European Union (Referendum) Bill, published by the Conservatives in 2013, proposed this form of words: ""Do you think that the United Kingdom should remain a member of the European Union?""Some thought that leaned too far towards the status quo, encouraging a yes vote, and the Electoral Commission said it was not clear and direct enough. The watchdog proposed this form of words instead: ""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union?""The new Conservative government will attempt to repeal the Human Rights Act, which requires UK courts to treat the European Court of Human Rights as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. The European Court of Human Rights is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe (CoE), which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine.The freedom for people to move around Europe, enshrined in the EU treaties, works in parallel with the other three basic freedoms in the single market: freedom of goods, capital and services.It is likely to be a ""red line"" for other EU leaders, who do not want to see it eroded.Mr Cameron has steered clear of tackling it directly - for example by asking for an emergency ""brake"" on free movement, or a cap on numbers - focusing instead on reducing the incentive provided by welfare payments. In a speech last November, David Cameron set out measures to reduce the number of EU nationals moving to the UK.His main proposals were:Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission, has said he is ready to work with Mr Cameron to ""strike a fair deal for the United Kingdom in the EU"". The leaders of other EU nations have previously warned they are unlikely to support major changes to EU treaties to accommodate British demands. But Mr Cameron's general election victory may have given him extra leverage. ""The ball is very much in the court of the UK now,"" a senior EU official told The Guardian. ""It's up to the British to define what they want."" The key figure will be German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is very keen to keep Britain in the EU but has so far been unwilling to make major concessions to enable that to happen. There are fears that a ""pick and mix"" approach to EU treaties would undermine EU cohesion.Mr Cameron has said there is ""no doubt"" his planned reforms will require changes to the treaties governing the European Union. But this would require the unanimous support of all EU members, and may not be possible within the deadline he has set of a referendum before the end of 2017. Any attempt to change EU laws on free movement would meet fierce resistance from some EU nations, particularly Eastern European states. Mr Juncker has said free movement is non-negotiable.Mr Cameron may find it difficult to get unanimous support for his proposals for a four-year waiting period for migrant workers claiming UK benefits. East European EU members would be likely to oppose this, on the grounds that it would discriminate against their citizens.  Attempts to secure opt-outs for the City are unlikely to go down well with other European leaders.However, there are precedents for EU treaty changes to accommodate some countries' specific concerns - for example, the protocol attached to the Lisbon Treaty for Ireland.Mr Cameron has faced repeated calls to say whether he would campaign for Britain's exit from the EU in the referendum if he fails to get what he wants from the renegotiation process. All he has said is that he will ""rule nothing out"". Some Conservative MPs want Britain to leave the EU no matter what David Cameron manages to renegotiate. A larger group are likely to want more concessions than Mr Cameron has so far indicated he is prepared to demand.Senior backbencher David Davis, who was defeated by Mr Cameron for the Tory leadership in 2005, told the Daily Telegraph the majority of the 332 Conservative MPs want Mr Cameron to negotiate an ""opt-out"" power to stop individual EU laws from applying to Britain. The prime minister has said this would be ""impossible"" without Britain leaving the EU.Mr Davis claims as many as 60 Tory MPs would be prepared to rebel and vote for Britain's exit from the EU if the prime minister fails to deliver.Graham Brady, chairman of the Tory backbench 1922 committee, which represents backbenchers, has urged David Cameron to give all Conservative MPs, including ministers, a free vote in the EU referendum.In January, Mr Cameron warned that serving cabinet ministers would have to quit the government if they wanted to campaign to leave the EU if he had secured the reforms to it he wants.In the 1975 referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Economic Community, as the EU was then called, Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson decided to suspend collective responsibility because his cabinet was split on the issue. Ministers were allowed to vote with their consciences and campaign against each other. The majority of them, including Mr Wilson, joined the Yes camp, but left-wingers, such as Tony Benn, played a leading role in the No campaign. The Yes campaign won easily with 67% of the vote."

2015-05-04,Scots Labour leader Murphy to resign,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32760196,"Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy is to resign next month, he has announced.It comes despite Mr Murphy narrowly surviving a vote of no confidence at a meeting of the party's national executive in Glasgow. Mr Murphy said he would tender his resignation alongside a plan to reform the party.He lost his seat in last week's general election as the SNP won 56 of the 59 Scottish seats, leaving Labour with a single MP in Scotland.Mr Murphy said he wanted to have a successor as leader in place by the summer, and confirmed he would not be standing for a seat at the Scottish Parliament in next year's election. Instead, he said it was time to ""do something else"" and that he believed the party would continue to be divided if he remained as leader. His deputy, Kezia Dugdale MSP, will become acting leader until a permanent successor is found. Mr Murphy had faced calls to resign from several MSPs, trade unions and former MPs in the wake of his party's near wipeout at the general election.He insisted he had decided to stand down ahead of the national executive voting by 17-14 in favour of him staying in the job.Speaking at a media conference after the national executive meeting, he said: ""It is clear that a small minority who didn't accept my election as leader of the Scottish Labour Party just five months ago won't accept the vote of the executive today and that will continue to divide the party.""Today I received more support in the executive vote than I did from members of the executive when I stood for election five months ago.""He said it would be up to the executive whether to accept the reforms he would be proposing before he left the post. But he warned: ""A party in such urgent need of reform blocks those changes at its peril.""The former East Renfrewshire MP said Labour had been crushed between ""two nationalisms"" in Scotland and England.Mr Murphy said he left no legacy of bitterness for anyone in the Labour Party, and the only person he was angry at was the person who blamed Scottish Labour for the party's UK-wide general election defeat - a reference to Unite leader Len McCluskey.And he said that in many ways Scottish Labour was the ""least modernised part of the Labour movement"" and that he wanted his successor to be elected under a one member, one vote system.Mr Murphy added: ""The Labour Party's problem is not the link with trade unions, or even the relationship with Unite members - far from it. It is the destructive behaviour of one high profile trade unionist.""The leader of the Scottish Labour Party doesn't serve at the grace of Len McCluskey, and the next leader of the UK Labour Party should not be picked by Len McCluskey.""Mr McCluskey has been a vocal critic of Mr Murphy's leadership and opposed his appointment in December when Mr Murphy won the contest to replace Johann Lamont.Jim Murphy laughed and joked with Scottish Labour's sole MP as he made his way down the hotel corridor to announce his resignation.He certainly brought energy and dynamism to his election campaign - but all that achieved was Ian Murray in Edinburgh South.So as Mr Murphy bows out, who could replace him?The deputy leader Kezia Dugdale may want to step up or Neil Findlay could try again after challenging last time. Maybe the party's finance spokeswoman Jackie Baillie thinks her steady hand could steer the ship.Jenny Marra is also often talked about as future face of the party.Whoever steps into Jim Murphy's red shoes he or she will have to face a difficult 2016 Holyrood election, to put it mildly.There are also more fundamental questions about how the party can possibly move on as it faces a surging SNP.Mr Murphy was very much a creature of ""New Labour"" - but to today's generation that's old Labour.Party members may start looking for someone with no links to the past, neither a Brownite nor a Blairite. A 'cleanskin' - as the politicos put it - may well help re-connect with voters.That's a long way from now though - even some of the party's opponents may view this latest train wreck with a modicum of sympathy. Ms Lamont had resigned after claiming Scottish Labour was treated like a ""branch office"" by the London-based party leadership.Mr Murphy concluded his speech by saying: ""Scotland needs a strong Labour party; Scotland needs a united Labour party. We have been the greatest force for change in our nation's remarkable history. ""The Scottish Labour party will rise again. It will be under someone else's leadership and I am confident about my party's future.""Harriet Harman MP, acting leader of the UK Labour Party, said it would be for Scottish Labour to choose a new leader. She added: ""As a cabinet minister and leader of his party in Scotland, Jim has been a hugely important figure in the Labour Party. He leaves with the best wishes and thanks of our movement.""Labour peer Lord McConnell, a former Scottish first minister, said the party's problems were ""much deeper than one individual and one affiliate"".He said: ""We have a disconnect locally and nationally with wider Scottish society. ""We have a problem with our political positioning in the post devolution age where the party particularly at the UK level has never been comfortable with success in the Scottish parliament and has always tried to see things through a UK prism rather than a Scottish prism.""We need to find a new generation, a new leader, new generation, new ideas, a fresh approach.""In a tweet, Scottish first minister and SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said: ""I wish Jim Murphy all the very best for the future. Leadership is not easy and he deserves credit for standing up for what he believes in.""Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson also reacted on Twitter, saying: ""Jim Murphy announces a managed exit in order to help the party, which is to his credit. But leaves a tough gig for whoever comes next.""The meeting of Scottish Labour's executive was disrupted by protesters who entered the party's headquarters.Police were called and the protesters, who included persistent anti-austerity activists Sean Clerkin and Piers Doughty-Brown, left the building to protest further from the street outside.The protesters were calling for Mr Murphy to remain as leader to ""finish the job of destroying Scottish Labour"".A Police Scotland spokeswoman said officers had been called and found two protestors on the third floor of the building. She added: ""Both left on police arrival. Advice and assistance was given."""
2015-05-04,Labour contenders clash on spending,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32761561,"Prospective Labour leaders have clashed over Labour's record in government in their first public debate in the race to succeed Ed Miliband.Former cabinet ministers including Yvette Cooper and Andy Burnham defended Labour's fiscal record and spending on schools and hospitals.However, candidates from the 2010 intake of MPs argued that the party spent too much while in office.The debate followed Chuka Umunna's withdrawal from the leadership contest.The remaining candidates appeared at the annual conference of the Progress think tank in London.There was agreement that Labour needed to demonstrate economic credibility to regain power, with shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt telling the meeting that the party needed to be ""trusted with public finances and the family finances"".Mr Hunt, who was first elected to Parliament in 2010 when Labour lost power, argued the last Labour government ""spent too much"" and failed to ""leave enough economic headroom to deal with the economic crisis and the recession"".Shadow health minister Liz Kendall said: ""There's absolutely nothing progressive about spending more on debt interest payments than on educating our children.""But shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: ""The Tories have had a triumph of spin over the facts in saying what they said about the economic record of the last Labour government.""The former chief secretary to the Treasury said the deficit did ""grow too large"" in the government's later years but insisted: ""The last Labour government ran more surpluses in its first term than the Tories did in 18 years.""Yvette Cooper, another former chief secretary to the Treasury, said: ""We should never let anybody tell us that it was too many teachers, doctors or nurses that caused Lehman Brothers bank in New York to crash.""Shadow international development secretary Mary Creagh said: ""People have forgotten the economic credibility that the last Labour government had.""She said Labour had built schools and hospitals that were ""treasured in our communities"".Ms Cooper, Mr Burnham, Ms Kendall and Ms Creagh have declared their intention to run for leader, while Mr Hunt told the conference he would make an announcement next week.At the same event, shadow energy secretary Caroline Flint announced she would be running for deputy leader.The Don Valley MP told the Today programme ahead of the debate that Labour lost the election because ""fundamentally the public did not trust us on the economy"".Exeter MP Ben Bradshaw has already announced a bid to be deputy, saying Labour ""must and could win the next election"", but only if it ""broadens its appeal by adopting sensible, centre-left politics which celebrate wealth creation and entrepreneurship"".Former Labour campaign co-ordinator Tom Watson is reported to be crowd-funding a deputy leadership bid, while Walthamstow MP Stella Creasy has said she is ""open to the question"" of running.Barnsley East MP and shadow transport secretary Michael Dugher - a fierce critic of Ed Miliband's election campaign - is to run Mr Burnham's campaign, according to the website LabourList.It is reported that Mr Burnham also has the backing of Labour peer Lord Falconer, who was lord chancellor and justice secretary under Tony Blair and was close to the former PM.Shadow culture secretary Chris Bryant has signalled his backing for Ms Cooper, tweeting that the next leader must be ""someone who's been tried in the fiery furnace of public opinion"".Mr Hunt said on Friday he would be be attending the debate - along with the other four hopefuls - to ""set out my analysis on how we begin to understand what went so wrong and why"".He added: ""We must use this leadership election to ask some very profound questions.""All voices in the party must be heard so that we can have a full and proper assessment as to why the politics of nationalism triumphed in Scotland and huge swathes of England, and how we have allowed the Conservative Party to present a more compelling vision for Britain to so many millions of people.""Speculation still surrounds shadow business secretary Mr Umunna's decision to pull out on Friday, when he said he was not ""comfortable"" with the ""pressure"" of being a candidate.As well as citing extensive pressure and scrutiny Mr Umunna also said he was ruling himself out because of concerns about the impact of the bid on his family.A rising star of the party, Mr Umunna was first elected to Parliament in 2010 - alongside Tristram Hunt and Liz Kendall - before joining the shadow cabinet.Asked about the candidate who might win, Conservative Chancellor George Osborne said: ""The Labour leadership contest has descended into farce.""But it's not actually about personalities. I don't think the Labour Party any more represents the working people of this country who aspire to a better life."""

I'm not suggesting he takes a break from being leader.""Clearly the national executive has the authority, they're the ruling body. ""I'm told that they made a decision. I'm told it was a procedurally correct decision, he is the leader but I think it's important that as leader he takes a break and I think it's important that we work out how these complex questions are answered by a team.""No one person has all the answers. I'm particularly concerned about tone, making sure we get a tone that ensures that the 27 million people who didn't vote for UKIP last week may be persuaded to vote for us in future.""The party has been beset by wrangling since Mr Farage agreed to stay on as leader, days after standing down after failing to get elected in Thanet South.He had pledged before the general election that he would quit the post if he failed to get elected to Parliament.Senior aide Matthew Richardson has left the party, following claims from MEP Patrick O'Flynn that Mr Farage had fallen under the influence of ""inexperienced"" advisers.UKIP has also confirmed the departure of Mr Farage's chief of staff Raheem Kassam.Mr Farage ruled out quitting as leader on BBC's Question Time on Thursday, saying he had ""phenomenal"" support, and has challenged his critics to decide whether they want to stay in the party.In his article, Mr Carswell had said that ""knowing how difficult it is to lead a party makes me admire Nigel Farage all the more"".""I know that I never could,"" he added, stressing that he would find it ""impossible to simultaneously lead UKIP, be the voice of the party in the Commons, represent my Clacton constituents and at the same time be a husband and a dad"".However, he said that ""even leaders need to take a break"", adding: ""Nigel needs to take a break now.""UKIP got nearly four million votes at the election, but returned only one MP - former Conservative Mr Carswell in the Clacton constituency."
2015-05-04,Coasting schools 'must improve',https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/education-32763097,"Education Secretary Nicky Morgan has said new powers to sack head teachers in coasting schools will show ""it is not OK to be just above the level of failing"". Under the plans, ministers could force schools rated as ""requiring improvement"" and missing new government benchmarks to become an academy.Coasting schools have average results which have often flatlined over time.Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, Mrs Morgan said faster action was needed.She said: ""Our big priorities will be to speed up the process for tackling failing schools; extend our academies programme to tackle 'coasting' schools; and deliver on our commitment to open new free schools.""The proposals will be in a new bill due to be introduced in the Queen's Speech. ""First, we will take new powers to step in from the moment that a school is found to be failing,"" Mrs Morgan said.""From day one, regional schools commissioners will be able to bring in new leadership and support from other excellent schools and heads, and we will speed up the process of turning schools into academies to make sure that new expert leadership is found for all schools that need it as quickly as possible.""She said that coasting schools will be put on an immediate notice to improve and could then be taken over and turned into an academy.They will be required to work with a team of ""expert"" head teachers.She said: ""Those that aren't able to demonstrate a clear plan for improvement will be given new leadership - we know this works in turning schools around.""More than 3,300 schools in England are labelled ""requires improvement"", but the plans are unlikely to cover that many schools.Under the current system, secondary schools are considered to be failing, and therefore eligible for intervention, if fewer than 40% of their students score at least five Cs at GCSE, including English and maths, and they do not meet national averages in pupil progress.In primary schools, the threshold for intervention is if fewer than 65% of pupils get Level 4 in reading, writing and maths and a below average number of pupils make the expected amount of progress.It is not yet clear how coasting schools will be deemed in need of intervention.It is understood that a new category will be devised covering schools which are rated as ""requires improvement"" and which fail to meet a new set of standards on improvement."
2015-05-04,Co-op Group to keep political funding,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-32762858,"The Co-operative Group has decided to continue financially supporting the Co-operative Party, which has strong ties to Labour.Members of the group, the UK's biggest mutual organisation, voted on the issue at their annual general meeting.They passed a motion by 48,579 for, to 39,479 against, to approve ""political expenditures"" of up to £1m which support the movement's objectives.Last year the Co-op Group gave £625,000 to the Co-op Party.This figure was down on the sums donated in previous years. The AGM also included a vote on new corporate governance procedures which would mean members having less of a direct say.The Co-operative Group is still recovering from a period of financial mismanagement and some members have recently expressed concerns about how elections to the board are chosen.The banking arm of the group came close to collapse in 2013, bringing the whole group to a £2.5bn annual loss that year. The Co-op Party includes among its members a number of Labour MPs, including shadow chancellor Chris Leslie and Walthamstow MP Stella Creasy. The politicians stand as candidates of both the Co-operative Party and the Labour Party, and the two political movements have strong historical ties. The board asked the members of the Co-operative Group whether they wanted to continue financially supporting the Co-operative Party, or any other party. Allan Leighton, chairman of the Co-op Group, said: ""There's a clear remit from the members to continue to support the Labour Party.""It allows us to now have a conversation with the Co-op Labour Party about what we do next.""There was also a members' motion on the agenda, put forward by those in favour of making political donations of up to £1m a year.The motion to approve political funding ""not to exceed £1m per annum"" was carried by 55.17% to 44.83%.BBC business correspondent Joe Lynam said: ""To meet a £1.5bn hole in its accounts - mostly stemming from its banking division - the Co-op Group has had to sell off parts of its businesses and hand over majority control of its bank to American hedge funds.""It's also in the process of radically changing the way it runs itself into a more corporate structure with less of a direct say by its members.""He said that ""in theory"", each of the 2.8 million Co-op members could vote on a series of motions about the reforms, as well as how its bosses are paid, and retaining the links to the Co-operative party.One of the group's largest independent societies, Midcounties, recently threatened legal action over a shortlist of six candidates for the group's board being reduced to three - the number of positions available - before a member vote.

2015-05-04,Osborne plans July 'stability' Budget,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32761566,"Chancellor George Osborne has said that he will deliver a new Budget on 8 July.He claimed it would have ""a laser-like focus"" on raising productivity and living standards.He said he was making the unusual move of having a second Budget in one year in order to ""deliver on the commitments we have made to working people"".Labour said the chancellor would have to set out ""who is going to pay"" for what it called ""uncosted promises"" in the election campaign.Speaking outside 11 Downing Street, the chancellor gave a broad outline of his plans for the forthcoming Budget but refused to be drawn on the details, including the Conservatives' planned £12bn of welfare cuts.""I don't want to wait to deliver on the commitments we have made to working people,"" he said.""It will continue with the balanced plan we have to deal with our debts, invest in our health service and reform welfare to make work pay.""But there will also be a laser-like focus on making our economy more productive so we raise living standards across our country.""We're going to put Britain into good shape for the long term.""The last Budget was held on 18 March and included tax cuts for first-time house buyers.Writing in the Sun, Mr Osborne admitted it was ""unusual"" to have two Budgets in the same year, but he wanted to turn ""promises made in the election into a reality"".Again, Mr Osborne did not specifically outline how the Conservatives plan to fulfil a pledge to cut £12bn in welfare spending but said he wants to make the welfare system ""fair for the people who pay for it"".He writes: ""We will protect the NHS and give it more funding each and every year, while making savings across Whitehall. ""We'll crack down hard on tax avoidance and aggressive tax planning by the rich - because everyone should pay their fair share.  ""We will always protect the most vulnerable, but we also need a welfare system that's fair to the people who pay for it. If you can work you should be working, so we'll take the next steps in our benefit reforms to make sure that happens.""Second, we've got to go on helping businesses create jobs in Britain, so we move towards full employment. That means facing a hard truth: in Britain we produce about a quarter less for every hour we work than countries like America or Germany. Fixing that long-running productivity weakness is the big challenge for the next five years.""So in the Budget we'll spend less on welfare, and instead invest to create three million more apprenticeships, so that young people can learn a trade, get better jobs and earn more.""After the Budget in March independent forecaster the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said that Mr Osborne needed to spell out exactly how he plans to cut £12bn from welfare spending.Of those £12bn planned cuts, £2bn were outlined ahead of the general election - all the cuts are supposed to be in place by 2017-18.Labour's shadow energy and climate change secretary, Caroline Flint, accused the Tories of making ""a number of uncosted promises"" during the election campaign.She told the BBC: ""It will be interesting to see who is going to pay for those uncosted policies when they bring the Budget in July."""
2015-05-04,Farage should take a break - Carswell,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32761766,"UKIP leader Nigel Farage ""needs to take a break now"", the party's only MP Douglas Carswell has said.Writing in the Times, Mr Carswell said he admired Mr Farage, but questioned his ""ill-advised"" comments about HIV patients, made in a TV leaders' debate.Mr Farage ruled out quitting as leader on BBC's Question Time on Thursday, saying he had ""phenomenal"" support.It follows a bitter internal row within the party, which has seen two of Mr Farage's senior aides resigning.In his article, Mr Carswell said that ""knowing how difficult it is to lead a party makes me admire Nigel Farage all the more"".""I know that I never could,"" he added, stressing that he would find it ""impossible to simultaneously lead UKIP, be the voice of the party in the Commons, represent my Clacton constituents and at the same time be a husband and a dad"".However, he said that ""even leaders need to take a break"", adding: ""Nigel needs to take a break now.""He described Mr Farage as ""inspirational"", saying the party had ""done extraordinarily well"" under his leadership but now needed to ""consider carefully what comes next"".Earlier, Mr Farage challenged his critics to decide whether they wanted him to stay in the party.He said he had ""massive"" support from UKIP MEPs, donors and party members to continue in the role, suggesting one person, whom he did not name, was ""agitating for change"".Addressing the prospect of a future EU referendum, Mr Carswell said: ""All of us UKIP supporters should ask one question; Is what I'm doing at this moment making an 'out' vote more likely? If it isn't, stop it and do something else.""He also criticised Mr Farage's comments about HIV patients during the TV leaders' debate last month.While debating about the NHS, Mr Farage said: ""You can come into Britain from anywhere in the world and get diagnosed with HIV and get the retro-viral drugs that cost up to £25,000 per year per patient.""Mr Carswell wrote: ""By all means we should highlight the problem of health tourism. But we need to admit that using the example of HIV patients to make the point was ill-advised.""He said the party needed to strike ""the right tone"" and added: ""UKIP has been at its most persuasive when we have been most optimistic.""Anger is never a great way to motivate people - at least not for very long.""The party has been beset by wrangling since Mr Farage agreed to stay on as leader, days after standing down after failing to get elected in Thanet South.He had pledged before the general election that he would quit the post if he failed to get elected to Parliament.Matthew Richardson has left the party, following claims from MEP Patrick O'Flynn that Mr Farage had fallen under the influence of ""inexperienced"" advisers. UKIP has also confirmed the departure of Mr Farage's chief of staff Raheem Kassam.UKIP got nearly four million votes at the election, but returned only one MP - former Conservative Mr Carswell in the Clacton constituency."
2015-05-04,Tributes as ex-Conservative MP dies,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-northamptonshire-32764540,"Tributes have been paid to former Conservative MP Sir Peter Fry who has died at the age of 83.Sir Peter, who had been ill for a year, was MP for Wellingborough and Rushden, in Northamptonshire, for 28 years from 1969 until his defeat by Labour in 1997.In government he was notable as an expert on transport issues.Current Wellingborough Conservative MP Peter Bone said Sir Peter remained ""extremely well thought of"".""When I was canvassing in the last election, people were still talking about him. They absolutely loved how he helped them and he was a highly-regarded local MP,"" Mr Bone said.""He stood up for what was right rather than what the party line was. In those days - the John Major years - it was much more difficult to stand up against the party machine. He had strong views on Europe.""Sir Peter started his career as an insurance broker, joining the Wycombe Young Conservatives in 1949 and the Oxford University Conservative Association in 1951.He went on to become a Conservative councillor on Buckinghamshire County Council between 1961 and 1967.Wellingborough mayor-elect Barry Graves also paid tribute to Sir Peter, remembering him as a ""very strong constituency MP"".""I remember going out and canvassing with him and he would go everywhere. He knew the area and the people. He was very much a man of the local constituency.""He was ""a very approachable man"", Mr Graves added.Sir Peter was knighted in 1994. "

2015-05-04,PM will 'look at' powers proposals,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32746049,"David Cameron has said he would ""look at"" any proposals for further powers for Scotland but wants to get the Smith Commission plans implemented first.The prime minister was speaking after meeting Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon in Edinburgh.Mr Cameron said he made a ""commitment"" to include a devolution bill in the Queen's Speech later this month.Ms Sturgeon argued the Smith Commission proposals were ""a good starting point"" but did not go far enough.The prime minister has pledged to include a bill on devolution in this month's Queen's Speech which would be based on the cross-party Smith Commission agreement. The Smith proposals included giving Holyrood the power to set income tax rates and bands, as well as control over a share of VAT and some welfare benefits. But Ms Sturgeon's SNP also wants the Scottish Parliament to be given powers over business taxes, employment law, the minimum wage and additional powers over welfare.Speaking after meeting Ms Sturgeon, Mr Cameron told the BBC: ""Let's make sure Smith is implemented in full. I'm going to keep the commitment I made to the people of Scotland. Let's get that done first because it does create a really strong Scottish Parliament.""He added: ""Of course, if people want to make future proposals I'll look at them.""The prime minister again said he did not support full fiscal autonomy for Scotland - the responsibility for all areas of tax and spending except defence and foreign affairs - stating that it would mean £7bn of cuts or extra tax-raising.What Nicola Sturgeon is trying to say is she has a mandate. She has 56 out of the 59 MPs elected in Scotland and she won 50% of the vote - unprecedented here in Scotland.She says that gives her leverage to push David Cameron. David Cameron says he wants to keep the nation together.The language coming out of Westminster last week was very much a cordial one. 'We will listen'.Nicola Sturgeon has warned him that if he doesn't listen, then the people of Scotland will judge him accordingly.Ms  Sturgeon described the hour-long talks at her official residence at Bute House as ""constructive and business-like"". She said Mr Cameron had made a ""commitment"" that the Smith proposals would be implemented ""as agreed"".""But secondly the prime minister agreed that he would look at proposals that we would now send to suggest the areas we can go beyond Smith,"" Ms Sturgeon said.""There was no agreement in terms of the substance of that but we will submit those proposals, the prime minister has said they will consider them and there will be a meeting to look at how we take that further forward.""Referring to her party's success in last week's general election, which saw the SNP win 56 out of 59 Scottish seats, Ms Sturgeon said: ""People in Scotland have now voted fairly convincingly for the SNP and sent a message that we want the Smith Commission proposals to go further and be built on.""The ball is in his court but I'm going into this in good faith.""She added: ""David Cameron and I are a world apart politically but, where we can, I'm determined to do business in the interests of the people of Scotland and across the UK.""She said she would have a ""constructive and business-like"" relationship with the prime minister. The two leaders shook hands on the front steps of Bute House as Mr Cameron arrived. Mr Cameron left the building shortly before 11:00, almost an hour after he had arrived.The two sides agreed to hold more regular discussions in the future, possibly quarterly. "
2015-05-04,Umunna withdraws Labour leader bid,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32748106,"Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna has withdrawn from the Labour party leadership contest, just days after throwing his hat into the ring.The MP, 36, said in a statement that he was not comfortable with the level of pressure and scrutiny that came with being a leadership candidate.Mr Umunna also cited concerns about the impact of the bid on his family.BBC political editor Nick Robinson said the MP's team insisted no ""unwelcome press story"" lay behind the move.But Mr Umunna had been shocked by the level of scrutiny of himself, his mother, sister and girlfriend, he said.You can follow the latest reaction here.A rising star of the party, Mr Umunna was first elected to Parliament in 2010 before joining the shadow cabinet.He confirmed his candidacy for the Labour leadership via a post on his Facebook page on 12 May, saying the party under Ed Miliband had failed to appeal to enough voters in England.But on Friday he said he had not found the leadership bid to be ""a comfortable experience"".I understand that Chuka Umunna has told friends that ""this is not right for me or people close to me. I'm human, the rest of my life is more important to me than politics.""The shadow business secretary has been distressed by the degree of scrutiny he, his family and his girlfriend have come under since he declared his intention to stand for the labour leadership.I am told that this includes reporters waiting outside the houses of relatives late at night.Friends of Mr Umunna deny that he is nervous of not getting the support of enough MPs to run for the leadership; they point out that he already has half the necessary names and that there are some weeks to go.The shadow business secretary now wants to play a leading role in arguing that Britain should stay in the EU and does not rule out seeking the leadership in the future.He said he thought he had understood ""the scrutiny and attention a leadership contest would bring"", but added: ""However, since the night of our defeat last week I have been subject to the added level of pressure that comes with being a leadership candidate.""The shadow business secretary said he had wondered if it was too soon for him to stand for the leadership, and ""I fear it was."" He also cited concerns about the impact on ""the rest of one's life"" and those close to him.""Consequently, after further reflection, I am withdrawing my candidacy,"" he said.Mr Umunna said he would continue to serve as shadow business secretary and hoped to ""play a leading role"" in Labour's campaign to keep the UK in the EU during the forthcoming in/out referendum.Commenting on the news, Labour former culture secretary Ben Bradshaw - who is expected to run for deputy leader - said Mr Umunna was a ""terrible loss"" to the field.He told the BBC's Daily Politics the Streatham MP had been the candidate the Conservative Party ""feared the most"".""And if it's the result of pressure on an extended family or an extended group of friends, I think that's a very sad reflection on our political culture,"" he said.Chuka Umunna feels ""liberated"", he told me, by his decision to quit the Labour leadership race.He hopes to be given a good role (shadow chancellor, I wonder?) by whoever becomes Labour leader. And I expect he'll become very high profile in the campaign to keep Britain in Europe, which is increasingly looking like it will be next May.He'll endorse a candidate in the next four weeks before nominations close. It will be very interesting to see who he piles in behind.Read more from Allegra (see post 13.23).Former Labour leader Lord Kinnock said he thought Mr Umunna had made the right decision.He said: ""If he felt in his soul that he wasn't prepared to subject himself - and more importantly his family - to the kind of attention which is fairly typical, sadly, these days, he has done absolutely the right thing.""There is no point at all in inflicting avoidable, unnecessary misery on those you love most.""Leadership contender Mary Creagh said she had ""huge respect"" for Mr Umunna, telling BBC Radio 4's World at One programme it took ""courage"" to withdraw from the leadership race.Mr Umunna was ""a big beast"" and would play a ""big role"" in the future of the Labour Party, she added.Yvette Cooper, Andy Burnham, Liz Kendall and Mary Creagh have already thrown their hats into the ring for Labour's top job while a number of other potential candidates, including Dan Jarvis, Alan Johnson and David Lammy, have ruled themselves out. Candidates must secure nominations from 34 colleagues - 15% of the party's MPs - by 15 June to make it on to ballot papers, which will be sent to members in August ahead of the leader's election a month later."

However, Mr Justice Stuart Smith at Southwark Crown Court said there was a ""very strong likelihood"" a custodial sentence would follow.The jury heard how Mote submitted numerous false expenses claims for payment for work that organisations had allegedly carried out on his behalf.Mote claimed the money was to pay whistleblowers in cash through third parties. He also said he had been ""targeted for being an anti-EU MEP.""During his time an MEP he also made £250,000 legitimate expenses claims.No date has been set for the sentencing."

2015-05-04,Round-up: BBC experts' analysis,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/election-2015-32650417,"The political future of the United Kingdom has become clearer after the results of the general election emerged around the country.David Cameron says he hopes to govern for all of the UK after the Conservatives took 331 seats - enough to form a slender majority in the Commons.Labour has been all but wiped out by the SNP in Scotland and suffered a disappointing set of results elsewhere, while the Lib Dems are left with just eight MPs after many party heavyweights such as Vince Cable and Danny Alexander lost their seats.So with battles won and lost and the fall-out and celebrations beginning, BBC correspondents examine the implications and challenges that lie ahead for the new government - and for those whose political careers have been ended by voters.No pollster, no pundit, no political leader saw it coming - not even David Cameron himself.Governing parties don't gain seats. Parties that have implemented painful cuts and are promising more certainly don't. Until that is the Conservative Party did - achieving what had seemed to be Mission Impossible - a Tory majority.Until that is David Cameron's personal triumph which triggered the near simultaneous resignation of his three principle opponents - Messrs Miliband, Clegg and Farage.They did so in part because they helped to crush their partners in coalition these last five years - reducing the Liberal Democrat parliamentary party to a size when it can fit into two London taxis and still have two seats to spare.In part because the extraordinary tidal wave of support for the SNP swept dozens of once safe Labour seats away.In part because Nigel Farage persuaded millions to vote for him but secured just one seat - not, though, the one he was standing in.Read more from Nick Robinson hereThe question uppermost in the prime minister's mind as he assembles his new government is how to keep the kingdom united.""Above all I want to bring our country together,"" he revealed after the result, ""to reclaim a mantle we should never have lost - the mantle of one nation, one United Kingdom"".Looking at the political landscape from Land's End today is very different to the view from John O'Groats.A sea of Conservative and Unionist blue dominates the scene across much of England, while a field of SNP nationalist yellow stretches to the horizon and beyond from the north.David Cameron's greatest challenge is to prevent the union he supports being torn apart by mutual resentment - resentment from Scotland at a Westminster government dominated by English Tories, and resentment from England at the preferential treatment people think is being given to the Scots.Those who assumed the future of the Union had been safeguarded by the Scottish referendum must think again.Read more from Mark Easton hereOne thing is rock-solid true: the Conservatives who worked on this campaign are as surprised by the result as the pollsters, pundits, politicians and general population.Maybe they shouldn't be - the economy is in good shape and the Conservatives had incumbency advantage.But when I travelled back from the prime minister's last rally with a group of exhausted Conservative campaign officials it was clear that 290 seats was a hoped-for target.No-one talked about anything over 300 seats, and no-one even mentioned an overall majority.So what special sauce pushed David Cameron into No 10 with a Commons majority?Mr Cameron had two simple messages in the campaign and he rarely veered away from them; the first - the economy is in good shape and the recovery is threatened by Labour. And the second - the SNP would hold a Labour-led government to ransom.Read more from Jonny Dymond hereBrian Taylor, BBC political editor, ScotlandOf all the comments on the overnight apocalypse, undoubtedly the most straightforward came from a defeated Scottish Labour MP.Since there were quite a few of them, let me narrow the focus a little. Come on down, Tom Harris.Mr Harris had plainly anticipated defeat. Nonetheless, he looked suitably lugubrious as his fate was confirmed.Why, he was asked eagerly, had Labour lost? ""Because we did not win enough votes.""Psephologically, it is perfect. Complete in itself. Psychologically, it sums up Labour's gloom without descending into subsidiary matters such as leadership, strategy and the rest. As a forward-thinking strategy, it is ideal. Win more votes. Simple.Read more from Brian Taylor hereThis has been an election which may have more profound consequences than almost any in living memory.We now face a generational decision about our future in Europe, with an EU referendum in two years' time almost certain.There will also be serious questions about the future of the Union, following an SNP landslide that has turned Scotland into a virtual one-party state.David Cameron's victory also represents a colossal achievement.Only once before in recent history has an incumbent government increased its majority - and that was Mrs Thatcher in her prime in the 1980s.It is also a significant personal victory for Mr Cameron and a rebuff for those in his party who had become increasingly sceptical about his ability to win.But while it may represent a defeat for those Tories who saw this election as a potential opportunity to rid themselves of David Cameron, he must now govern with a wafer-thin majority.For the SNP, their stunning victory can only increase the pressure on Nicola Sturgeon to include a commitment to a second independence referendum in her party's manifesto for next year's Scottish elections.It is an election which has not just defied all the predictions of the pollsters and pundits - but which may yet prompt the most fundamental re-casting of British politics for a generation.Read more from Norman Smith hereAfter an extraordinary night, some brief conclusions:Read more from James Landale hereIs this the end of the union?That is the question many people will be asking this morning after the party which has fought for Scottish independence for 80 years swept to victory.The answer from the jubilant Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon is a firm ""No"".She insists that her MPs will speak for all of Scotland, not just for the 45% who voted for the country to leave the United Kingdom last September.In the closing hours of the most extraordinary election campaign which anyone in Scotland can remember, Ms Sturgeon turned to talk of ""legitimacy.""That will be her watchword in the coming days as she argues that the prime minister cannot ignore the democratic will of the Scottish people.Politically, Scotland and England this morning look and feel like very different countries.Read more from James Cook hereAfter weeks of chatter about an election too close to call, it wasn't that close at all.David Cameron will be continuing as our prime minister.So, what is all this likely to mean?A referendum on whether the UK stays in, or leaves, the European Union, within the next two-and-a-half years.A race to be the next leader of the Labour Party.A race to be the next leader of the Liberal Democrats.And a huge new presence of Scottish National Party MPs at Westminster.And so here's another thing we know for certain this morning: Politics ain't going to be boring any time soon.Read more from Chris Mason hereFor Labour the story of their terrible night is rapidly turning into the search for a new leader. So who will that be?Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, is almost certain to run.  Even before this election, both he and another almost inevitable candidate, Chuka Umunna, had raised eyebrows inside the party at the work they had put in, preparing the ground with members and the unions for potential bids.Yvette Cooper, before the election, was still thought not to have made up her mind over whether to run. That decision has been made perhaps a little easier as her husband, Ed Balls, has lost his seat.She is certainly potentially in the frame, along with two lesser known names - Liz Kendall and Dan Jarvis - two MPs who were only elected in 2010 for the first time. This could be their moment. But whoever is in the job, they face a monumental task.Read Laura Kuenssberg's Twitter hereSterling is up (the most for seven years against the euro), share prices are up (especially bank shares like Lloyds and RBS, and energy shares such as Centrica), government bond prices are up.To state the obvious, investors love the Tories' general election victory.There are a few reasons.One (no surprise here) is that Labour's threat of breaking up banks and imposing energy price caps has been lifted.Second is that investors have been discounting days and weeks of wrangling after polling day over who would form the government - and so they are semi-euphoric that we already know who's in charge.Third, many investors tend to be economically conservative and instinctively Conservative.But although the City may be a bit drunk on the result, its pleasure in Ed Miliband's and Ed Balls' humiliation may be making it a bit blind - perhaps dangerously so - to some bumps in the economic road ahead.Read more from Robert Peston hereNigel Farage dreamed of holding the balance of power, but in the end his UKIP party is now worse off than when it came into the election.At the seventh time of asking he was rejected - this time by the people of Thanet South. It was a similar story in Rochester and Strood where Mark Reckless, who sensationally defected from the Tories last year, was also sent packing.In seats on UKIP's target list, like Thurrock in Essex, the party failed to make gains. In Grimsby - where Mr Farage went twice in the last six weeks - they came third.UKIP got around four million votes - with especially strong showings in north-east and south-east England - but it's ended up with just one MP, and a vacancy at the top. This has led to UKIP attacking the current system of choosing MPs, which it's described as ""busted"" and ""dysfunctional"".In one sense, this campaign was a complete failure and it's left an aftermath of angry voters, and others wondering if the UKIP bubble has burst.Read Robin Brant's Twitter hereI monitored 91 GB-wide voting intention polls during the 2015 election campaign and found nothing in them to prepare me for the final outcome.The good news for the pollsters was that their share for the Lib Dems was pretty close, as were the shares for UKIP, the Greens and the catch-all category of Others.The bad news for the polling industry was that the crucial shares for Conservative and Labour were the ones where they came most adrift.When all the qualifications of margins of error are allowed, there did appear to be a systematic overstatement of the Labour share and an equally systematic understatement of the Conservative one.It is for the pollsters to decide whether to conduct a review of their performance but I trust they will avoid the initial knee-jerk reaction of the immediate aftermath of the 1992 polls debacle.This general election performance follows the performance of the polls in the 2014 Scottish referendum where the choice was simply binary and yet all the polls were out by between 4-6%.Something is wrong. A lot of us would like to know what it is.Read more from David Cowling hereThe words ""political earthquake"" have been translated into numerous European languages, making front page news across the continent.While Britons now examine the domestic minutiae of the election result, here in mainland Europe the vote means one thing: a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU. And that has the potential to create an earthquake of its own.The guardian of the EU treaties Mr Cameron wants to change - Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker - has said again he'd listen to what Britain's new government proposed.Read more from Katya Adler here"

2015-05-04,A history of political plots,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32749971,"Nigel Farage has apparently seen off a challenge to his leadership of UKIP - a move described by his former election strategist as a ""coup"". He's not the only party leader to face an attempted ousting. But can you recover from such a revolt?In 2006, the Labour prime minister was the target of what became known as the ""curry house conspiracy"" - a coup to remove him and install his chancellor, Gordon Brown, as prime minister.It would lead to several of the plotters' resignations - but not Mr Blair's. However, it was successful to a degree in that it forced the party leader into naming a departure date.The move against him was reportedly masterminded by Tom Watson, a defence minister at the time, who was also rumoured to have had a secret meeting with Mr Brown on the eve of the revolt.Apparently, Mr Watson and three fellow West Midlands MPs - Sion Simon, David Wright (both ministerial aides) and Khalid Mahmood - met over a biryani at a Wolverhampton curry house to discuss the PM's future, before dispatching a missive calling for him to quit.The letter - which attracted the support of a number of normally loyal Labour MPs - was leaked to the press, and ultimately resulted in Mr Watson's resignation.In his parting letter, the West Bromwich East MP took a shot at the prime minister, who he said should step down in the interests of party and country.Mr Blair denounced his actions and branded the former minister ""disloyal, discourteous and wrong"", saying he would have sacked him if he had not resigned.But Mr Watson's departure was swiftly followed by the resignations of six other junior members of government - who had also signed the rebel letter - in protest at the prime minister's refusal to say when he would step down as Labour leader.The whole affair resulted in Mr Blair announcing his intention to step aside within 12 months - which he duly did, on 27 June 2007.But it did nothing to quash internal dissent and speculation in the party over the future leadership of the party.Labour prime minister Gordon Brown found his leadership under threat in 2009 after one of his cabinet ministers dramatically quit the government and called for him to resign.Work and Pensions Secretary James Purnell - a former aide to Tony Blair - resigned from his post after the polls closed in the local and European elections, in which Labour was forecast to do badly.Explaining his decision to quit, Mr Purnell said the prime minister made a Conservative victory ""more, not less, likely"".It was Mr Brown's first direct challenge from a cabinet minister - but it would not topple the Labour leader as senior members of government refused to follow Mr Purnell's lead.Mr Brown was safe for the time being. But several months later, in January 2010, a fresh leadership challenge was mounted by two senior former Labour cabinet ministers.Geoff Hoon and Patricia Hewitt wrote to all Labour MPs, saying the party was ""deeply divided"" over Mr Brown's leadership and that the best way to resolve the issue was by way of secret ballot.They insisted it was not an ""attempted coup"" but a necessary step to resolve divisions within the party.But the duo could only muster the public support of a handful of backbenchers long-opposed to Mr Brown, with the majority of the party's MPs less than impressed by the move, which came just weeks before the general election.As the day wore on, a succession of cabinet ministers came out to back the PM, suggesting there was little momentum behind the plot - although it was noted that several were not exactly gushing in their support of Mr Brown.As history tells us, neither leadership challenge bore fruit but they reflected the internal doubts and divisions over Mr Brown at the helm.As leadership toppling attempts go, this one in 2014 was regarded as a particularly ""botched"" and ""shambolic coup"". Indeed, former Lib Dem leader Lord (Paddy) Ashdown described the move as a ""plot of deep malice"".Its instigator, Lord (Matthew) Oakeshott - a close ally of the-then Business Secretary Vince Cable - tried to unseat Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg.The peer was found to have commissioned secret polls suggesting the party would do better at the 2015 general election without Mr Clegg in the driving seat.The man Lord Oakeshott had long had in mind to take Mr Clegg's place - Mr Cable, who was on government business in China at the time - was forced to publicly condemn his friend's actions and state his backing for Mr Clegg.But Lord Oakeshott said the business secretary had in fact known about his polls and their findings.Nevertheless, the peer - who was denounced by the Lib Dem leadership for spending money that could have been spent on campaigning - quit the party, and issued a warning shot on his way out about the Lib Dems' future prospects.Mr Cable largely emerged unscathed but he faced questions about his loyalty to the leader. Although the two sought to put paid to reports of a rift with a (painfully awkward, 'nothing to see here, folks') stage-managed pint in a pub.Although the revolt failed, and Mr Clegg remained at the helm, the Lib Dems did go on to suffer a trouncing at the general election, losing nearly 50 of its MPs - one of them, Mr Cable himself - prompting his leader to quit.The Conservatives have a reputation for being more ruthless than their party rivals when it comes to getting rid of leaders they sense are no longer effectual.But, in 1995, Prime Minister John Major - tired of persistent rumours of a leadership challenge - decided to take the bull by the horns and trigger a surprise leadership election to silence his detractors.His own backbenchers had questioned Mr Major's ability to unite and lead the party, which was deeply divided over Europe.So ""put up or shut up"", he told them as he tendered his resignation as Conservative Party leader but not prime minister.But then stepped forward eurosceptic MP John Redwood, who resigned from the cabinet in order to contest Mr Major's leadership.This was unexpected by many, as the PM had said there had been assurances from his cabinet that none would stand against him.But Mr Major went on to win the ensuing election with a comfortable defeat over his challenger, who was not included in the PM's consequent cabinet reshuffle.No further contested leadership election took place until after the Conservatives' defeat at the 1997 general election, paving the way for William Hague to take over the running of the party.Not all attempts to oust a party leader end in failure: as Margaret Thatcher found out to her peril.With three electoral victories under her belt, the Conservative prime minister's downfall would come at the hands of her own party - not the voters.It was on 1 November 1990 when Geoffrey (now Lord) Howe - one of Mrs Thatcher's longest-serving ministers - resigned over differences with the party leader over Europe.In his now infamous speech on the floor of the House of Commons, he attacked the PM's policies and leadership style, comparing being one of her cabinet ministers to opening the batting at cricket only to find his bat had been ""broken... by the team captain"".It sparked the beginning of the end of the 11-year Thatcher reign.Michael (now Lord) Heseltine seized on the opportunity to challenge the prime minister in the ensuing leadership contest, from which she would eventually withdraw and John Major emerge as her successor. Reflecting on the revolt and its implications on the Conservative Party, Baroness Thatcher's biographer Charles Moore wrote: ""Because the coup was unjustified, and so trust broke down, the politics of the next 15 years were those of civil war."""
2015-05-04,Election swings and roundabouts,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-32741924,"If election manifesto claims are all about smoke and mirrors, should we now add swings and roundabouts to the political metaphor?There's an intriguing aspect to the general election results in the Midlands that puzzled me.It's the striking contrast in the swings between Labour and the Conservatives.David Cameron and his campaign strategists knew they were home and dry when Nuneaton was the first Midlands marginal to declare.It was not only a Tory hold but a swing to the Conservatives from Labour of 3%.I was in the Nottingham suburb of Beeston awaiting the result of the Broxtowe count. Would its high profile Conservative MP Anna Soubry survive a red surge?Nuneaton set the pattern. Across the Midlands, both east and west, there was a uniform swing of between three and four per cent to the Tories - Warwickshire North 3%, Amber Valley 4%, Derbyshire South 4% and Sherwood 4%. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan topped the Tory swingometer in the Midlands marginals with 5% in Loughborough.Yet in the big cities, it was a very different story. The swing went to Labour.So in Nottingham East they enjoyed a 6% swing, Nottingham South 5.8%, Leicester South 7.3%, Leicester West 5%, Birmingham Hall Green 12%, Birmingham Hodge Hill 8%.If swings to Labour on this scale had gone beyond the city ring road roundabouts and into the suburbs, Ed Miliband would have become prime minister by now.In confidence, one senior Labour insider in Nottingham told me its success in the city wards was down to organisation, experience and its teams of activists.""We won the ground war. If Nottingham's city boundaries were extended into Sherwood and Broxtowe, we would have won those constituencies as well,"" he told me.Labour leadership candidate, Leicester West's Liz Kendall has identified her party's problem beyond the ring road roundabout.It's about reaching out to Middle England.""We need to show people that we understand their aspirations and ambitions for the future,"" she told the Sunday Times.The problem for Labour was that Middle England was not interested in what the party offered…and still isn't. The Cameron brand worked its magic in those Midlands marginals... it'll take something or someone special to break up that ballot box relationship."
2015-05-04,Royal 'lobbying',https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32740154,"Prince Charles sent 27 letters to then Prime Minister Tony Blair and members of his government between September 2004 and March 2005, ""despite the Freedom of Information Act!"" as the prince joked in one.But did his suggestions and concerns have any bearing on the behaviour of Mr Blair's government?The request: Prince Charles expresses his worries over an EU directive on complementary medicines ""which is… effectively outlawing the use of certain herbal extracts"".  Mr Blair replied, offering moral support and practical help. He agreed that ""the implementation as it is currently planned is crazy"" and set out an action plan that included delaying implementation for all existing products to 2011. What happened: Herbal products were not required to be authorised until 2011, just as Mr Blair had promised. Prince Charles continues to sell his own brand of complementary products, Duchy Herbals, through Boots and Waitrose. The request: Writing to Mr Blair, the prince expresses a ""growing sense of anxiety"" that the Hill Farming Allowance, which supports farmers working on Britain's uplands, could be scrapped. In his reply, the prime minister said he understood that the Hill Farm Allowance would continue until 2007. What happened: The allowance lasted until the end of Labour's tenure in 2010, when it was abolished.The request: Just 18 months after the US-led invasion of Iraq, Prince Charles raised the issue of poor performance of Lynx helicopters in high temperatures, saying: ""I fear that this is just one more example of where our Armed Forces are being asked to do an extremely challenging job (particularly in Iraq) without the necessary resources.""Mr Blair replied: ""On the subject of the Lynx helicopter, the limitations of the existing platform, particularly in the extremely challenging environment within Iraq, are well recognised by the Ministry of Defence."" He added that replacement of the helicopters would be a priority. What happened: Mr Blair's comments go much further than what he was saying about the subject at the time. In the event, though, the fleet was not fully upgraded until 2011.The request: Prince Charles lamented that the government's TB prevention plans might not ""include a commitment to deal with the badger problem in the immediate future"" and pushed strongly for a cull, saying: ""All I can say is that I do urge you to look again at introducing a proper cull of badgers where it is necessary.""Mr Blair sympathised, saying he could ""personally see the case for culling badgers"". However, he was unwilling to commit to a cull.  What happened: Culling trials were conducted from 1998-2005. The final results, published in 2008, said that the badger cull could ""make no meaningful contribution"" to curbing bovine TB. It wasn't until 2013 that a full culling programme began in two pilot areas. These ended with the conclusion that the pilots had been neither humane nor effective at curbing the spread of TB.The request: Then Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell wrote to Prince Charles to say she had decided to give parts of the historic Smithfield meat market Grade II listed status, and was trying to persuade deputy prime minister John Prescott to ""call in"" the planning application to prevent demolition of other parts of the site. She had been swayed by evidence provided by Sir Neil Cossons, who was English Heritage chair at the time, after he had been asked by the prince to add his support. Prince Charles replied that he was ""extremely glad to read of your appreciation of the value of this group of buildings"". According to the Guardian, market workers desperate to see the redevelopment of the site invited the prince to meet them to discuss it, but his office said he was ""unlikely to accept as he did not want to interfere in the planning process"".What happened: Smithfield market is still the subject of planning battles a decade on. Successive planning applications have been refused by ministers. Last year then Communities Secretary Eric Pickles rejected plans for an office development on the site, stating that ""the extent of damage that the application would cause to the important heritage assets at Smithfield runs entirely counter to national and policy objectives intended to protect such assets from harm"".In March, the Museum of London announced a move from its current Barbican site to the Smithfield market building."
2015-05-04,Election fallout,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32703139,"""Some of those gimmicks - that tombstone, whatever idiot thought that up I do not know!""I was talking to the former Mayor of Crawley in Sussex, John Mortimer, in the town's Labour Supporters Club about the vexed question of what went wrong, and where Labour should go next. This seat is one of those southern seats Labour hoped to take, but failed.I hear a whole range of views in the club.""They didn't give nothing to depend on, they should be clear, and a little bit more down to Earth."" ""Good party, wrong leader, they don't look after business enough.""Councillor John Stanley tells me: ""I think in a way we did go too left, but now we can go a bit centre-left, or centre, depending who the new leader is.""The former mayor sums up the mood on the doorstep: ""Whatever we told them, they didn't believe us.""  Expect to hear all those views, and more, in the coming leadership contest. Step back from the angst of supporters, and it may not be that hard to see why Labour failed.  An economic recovery, hailed by independent organisations as the result of government policy, undid a party that had loudly proclaimed for five years that the coalition's policies would lead to economic disaster. Combine that with an uncharismatic and uninspirational leader, then you might argue no further debate is necessary.Fat chance of that. Defeat breeds resentment, and this one has opened up old divisions.  A chorus of Blairties, led by the man himself, has declared that Ed's problem was ignoring those with aspiration and ambition, failing to appeal to those running business. Incidentally, I've been ticked off by the perspicacious editor of the New Statesman, Jason Cowley, for using the ""unhelpful"" term ""Blairites"".I can't think of another description that fits Tony, Lord Mandelson, Lord Adonis and David Miliband quite so well. But call them what you will, the message was clear - Ed was too left wing, Labour should move back to the centre, or, if you like, to the right.Reading Mr Blair's pithy analysis, listening to Lord Mandelson's gripping and savage eloquence, describing a party sent out to shout: ""We love the poor and hate the rich,"" and so ignoring the middle, and you realise strong emotions are in play.But back to the future may not be sufficient. Of course elections are won on the centre ground. But grandees grinding axes, affronted by the failure of boys who used to make their tea, may be creating so much noise that they can't hear more insistent sounds.  For there are several elephants trumpeting loudly as they cram into the small space of the shadow cabinet room. Imagine these beasts are as gaily decorated as Berlin buddy bears. One is decked out in red, another in imperial purple bunting, and another, a mammoth, strong tusked and ice rimmed, painted yellow with tartan trimmings.Take the last first. The Scottish wipeout is Labour's biggest problem. Fail to solve it, and Labour can forget ever having a comfortable majority again. It is hard to argue Labour were wiped out in Scotland because the SNP outflanked them to the right with their appeal to the business community and the ambitious and aspirational. But it is true the SNP drew in to people from left, right and centre, just as the modernisers say Labour should. It was the politics of economic self-interest, but cast in a very different light. Tribally sneering at ""the reactionary ideology of nationalism"" as Mr Blair does, will not reach the central belt of Scotland, the middle ground of  Midlothian.What about that purple pachyderm?  In Crawley - in fact in seat after seat - there is a similar pattern.  Labour did, in fact, often increase the size of their vote. So did the Conservatives, usually by a bit more. But the real dynamic was the total collapse of the Lib Dems and the dramatic rise of UKIP. The increase in votes for Nigel Farage's party wasn't translated into parliamentary seats, but, although it is early days in terms of research, it probably hurt Labour a lot. If we believe - and I do - Matthew Goodwin and Rob Ford, authors of Revolt on the Right, these voters are often former Labour supporters - older, less educated, those left behind on the tides of  globalisation, stranded on the shores of post-industrialisation. They may have had too many disappointments to feel much ambition or aspiration. They are a challenge for Labour, and any new leader will spend a good deal of time thinking how to deal with the concerns of Europe and immigration.Whether to share their fears, or confront them will be a big decision.Which brings us to Red Nellie. Those members who still proudly call themselves socialist. This is not about Old Labour - they are more likely to be baristas or barristers than boilermakers. It is easy as an outsider, as a journalist, to treat politics as an intellectual game about how best to win power - but many people, particularly the foot soldiers, particularly after the death of  purely tribal loyalties, are in it because they passionately believe in winning  power to do something specific.Many of them are suspicious of the later incarnations of New Labour, not because it reached an accommodation with wealth and business, but because it seemed to worship at the same altar, to regard the party's core beliefs in redistribution and equality as childish fantasies from a past age.Perhaps to Mr Blair, they are the problem, people who may equate ""ambition"" with greed. They might point out that a man who claims to be worth ""only"" £20m may find it harder than most to squeeze through the eye of a needle to understand their point of view. Most successful Labour leaders will confront the left at some point, but the concerns of this group go to the existential question ""What is the party for?""This is not a polemic - not an argument about what should be done, but a reflection on the complex conundrums that will face any new Labour leader, the tearing apart of the old alliance that made up a Labour majority, and so the political need to satisfy groups with very different, indeed, contradictory demands. But looking for a Social Democratic universal theory of everything may be missing the point. What the party desperately wants is a leader who can pull the disparate threads together and articulate them as common purpose. Whether she or he exists is another matter.Much more on that in the coming months."
2015-05-04,'Take us with you',https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-32736153,"Thousands of people in the north of England have been using the hashtag ""take us with you Scotland"" to express their upset about the result of last week's general election, and Scottish nationalists are welcoming this English minority with open arms. Last Thursday's general election was a rough one for the Labour Party in its traditional stronghold in the north of England. But further to the north, the left-leaning Scottish National Party won nearly every seat it contested. That political contrast has made some left-wing voters in places like Manchester, Leeds and Sheffield look fondly on their neighbours. Since last Thursday's election in Britain the phrase ""take us with you Scotland"" has been used more than 24,000 times. ""Genuinely beginning to wonder if the North of England becoming a part of Scotland would be better for us, I really am,"" tweeted Aaron Miller from Yorkshire. Some cracked jokes under the tag after the North West Motorway Police account, which gives traffic updates, announced that they had ""picked up a pedestrian on the M62 who was trying to walk to Scotland.""After an initial spike of jokes over the weekend, the hashtag really took off when users start to mobilise in support of around a year-old petition on the campaigning site Change.org. The petition calls for the north of England to secede from the rest of the country and join up with Scotland, and more than 12,000 people have signed it.Its creator, a Sheffield resident who calls himself ""Stu Dent"", set it up to coincide with last year's Scottish independence referendum, and he also created a map imagining the boundary of a ""Scotland plus the north"" country.Stu Dent runs the Twitter account Hunters Bar, named after an area of southwest Sheffield which is very popular with - you guessed it - students. Despite the account having thousands of followers on Twitter, when the map was first posted last year, the image was shared only about 100 times - however, in the past week it's been retweeted by thousands. Stu Dent told BBC Trending that he was surprised at how popular his idea has become. ""In hindsight, perhaps I shouldn't have been,"" he said. ""There is a huge frustration in parts of the UK about the things that have happened since 2010.""""I think people need a place to go where they can say 'not in my name! This is not the England I want',"" he added. But in addition to disappointment from some quarters about the election result, there might be another reason why the petition is getting a boost now: the power of the Scottish Nationalists on Twitter. What started as a post-election joke in the North of England was quickly embraced by the so-called ""Cyber Nats"" - and a trend was born.The SNP's social media strategist Ross Colquhoun expressed the party's mood about the hashtag best, in a post which was shared more than 500 times. ""2014: #LetsStayTogether 2015: #TakeUsWithYouScotland What a difference a year makes"" he tweeted.Blog by Hannah HendersonNext story: The sport reporter and the obscene ranter who lost his jobFollow BBC Trending on Twitter @BBCtrending, and find us on Facebook."
2015-05-04,What Britain wants from Europe,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32695399,"David Cameron says he has a mandate to pursue EU reform following the Conservatives' general election victory. The PM, who will be hoping his majority government will give him extra leverage in Brussels, wants to renegotiate the terms of the UK's membership ahead of a referendum by the end of 2017. He has said he will campaign for Britain to remain in the EU if he gets the reforms he wants.Mr Cameron has said he does not want to reveal full details of his negotiating hand but he has given a broad indication, in a series of speeches and newspaper articles, of his priorities when he goes into talks with other EU leaders.These are: The prime minister has said Britain would resist any move towards a European Army and that he wants to free British police forces from EU interference. He has also ruled out Britain joining the euro.But he has placed less emphasis in recent years on demanding changes to EU social policy, such as the maximum 48-hour working week, agency workers, maternity leave and non-discrimination rules.The official UK government position is that a referendum will be held by the end of 2017 but Downing Street sources have said: ""If we can do it earlier we will.""There is speculation David Cameron is planning to hold the vote in 2016 to avoid a clash with French and German elections in 2017.The prime minister wants treaty change but even if the referendum was held in 2017 there may not be enough time to legally incorporate any reforms into a treaty and it would have to be done at a later stage.An early referendum would anger Eurosceptics who believe it would not allow enough time to make the case for exit or negotiate any meaningful concessions.""A rushed process would severely undermine the chances to secure a significant deal that both British business and voters could support and would waste the opportunity of a lifetime,"" Matthew Elliott, chief executive of Business for Britain told Breitbart London.The question is always crucial in any referendum and there is already a debate about what it should be. The Draft European Union (Referendum) Bill, published by the Conservatives in 2013, proposed this form of words: ""Do you think that the United Kingdom should remain a member of the European Union?""Some thought that leaned too far towards the status quo, encouraging a yes vote, and the Electoral Commission said it was not clear and direct enough. The watchdog proposed this form of words instead: ""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union?""The new Conservative government will attempt to repeal the Human Rights Act, which requires UK courts to treat the European Court of Human Rights as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. The European Court of Human Rights is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe (CoE), which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine.The freedom for people to move around Europe, enshrined in the EU treaties, works in parallel with the other three basic freedoms in the single market: freedom of goods, capital and services.It is likely to be a ""red line"" for other EU leaders, who do not want to see it eroded.Mr Cameron has steered clear of tackling it directly - for example by asking for an emergency ""brake"" on free movement, or a cap on numbers - focusing instead on reducing the incentive provided by welfare payments. In a speech last November, David Cameron set out measures to reduce the number of EU nationals moving to the UK.His main proposals were:Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission, has said he is ready to work with Mr Cameron to ""strike a fair deal for the United Kingdom in the EU"". The leaders of other EU nations have previously warned they are unlikely to support major changes to EU treaties to accommodate British demands. But Mr Cameron's general election victory may have given him extra leverage. ""The ball is very much in the court of the UK now,"" a senior EU official told The Guardian. ""It's up to the British to define what they want."" The key figure will be German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is very keen to keep Britain in the EU but has so far been unwilling to make major concessions to enable that to happen. There are fears that a ""pick and mix"" approach to EU treaties would undermine EU cohesion.Mr Cameron has said there is ""no doubt"" his planned reforms will require changes to the treaties governing the European Union. But this would require the unanimous support of all EU members, and may not be possible within the deadline he has set of a referendum before the end of 2017. Any attempt to change EU laws on free movement would meet fierce resistance from some EU nations, particularly Eastern European states. Mr Juncker has said free movement is non-negotiable.Mr Cameron may find it difficult to get unanimous support for his proposals for a four-year waiting period for migrant workers claiming UK benefits. East European EU members would be likely to oppose this, on the grounds that it would discriminate against their citizens.  Attempts to secure opt-outs for the City are unlikely to go down well with other European leaders.However, there are precedents for EU treaty changes to accommodate some countries' specific concerns - for example, the protocol attached to the Lisbon Treaty for Ireland.Mr Cameron has faced repeated calls to say whether he would campaign for Britain's exit from the EU in the referendum if he fails to get what he wants from the renegotiation process. All he has said is that he will ""rule nothing out"". Some Conservative MPs want Britain to leave the EU no matter what David Cameron manages to renegotiate. A larger group are likely to want more concessions than Mr Cameron has so far indicated he is prepared to demand.Senior backbencher David Davis, who was defeated by Mr Cameron for the Tory leadership in 2005, told the Daily Telegraph the majority of the 332 Conservative MPs want Mr Cameron to negotiate an ""opt-out"" power to stop individual EU laws from applying to Britain. The prime minister has said this would be ""impossible"" without Britain leaving the EU.Mr Davis claims as many as 60 Tory MPs would be prepared to rebel and vote for Britain's exit from the EU if the prime minister fails to deliver.Graham Brady, chairman of the Tory backbench 1922 committee, which represents backbenchers, has urged David Cameron to give all Conservative MPs, including ministers, a free vote in the EU referendum.In January, Mr Cameron warned that serving cabinet ministers would have to quit the government if they wanted to campaign to leave the EU if he had secured the reforms to it he wants.In the 1975 referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Economic Community, as the EU was then called, Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson decided to suspend collective responsibility because his cabinet was split on the issue. Ministers were allowed to vote with their consciences and campaign against each other. The majority of them, including Mr Wilson, joined the Yes camp, but left-wingers, such as Tony Benn, played a leading role in the No campaign. The Yes campaign won easily with 67% of the vote."

2015-05-05,Scots Labour leader Murphy to resign,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32760196,"Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy is to resign next month, he has announced.It comes despite Mr Murphy narrowly surviving a vote of no confidence at a meeting of the party's national executive in Glasgow. Mr Murphy said he would tender his resignation alongside a plan to reform the party.He lost his seat in last week's general election as the SNP won 56 of the 59 Scottish seats, leaving Labour with a single MP in Scotland.Mr Murphy said he wanted to have a successor as leader in place by the summer, and confirmed he would not be standing for a seat at the Scottish Parliament in next year's election. Instead, he said it was time to ""do something else"" and that he believed the party would continue to be divided if he remained as leader. His deputy, Kezia Dugdale MSP, will become acting leader until a permanent successor is found. Mr Murphy had faced calls to resign from several MSPs, trade unions and former MPs in the wake of his party's near wipeout at the general election.He insisted he had decided to stand down ahead of the national executive voting by 17-14 in favour of him staying in the job.Speaking at a media conference after the national executive meeting, he said: ""It is clear that a small minority who didn't accept my election as leader of the Scottish Labour Party just five months ago won't accept the vote of the executive today and that will continue to divide the party.""Today I received more support in the executive vote than I did from members of the executive when I stood for election five months ago.""He said it would be up to the executive whether to accept the reforms he would be proposing before he left the post. But he warned: ""A party in such urgent need of reform blocks those changes at its peril.""The former East Renfrewshire MP said Labour had been crushed between ""two nationalisms"" in Scotland and England.Mr Murphy said he left no legacy of bitterness for anyone in the Labour Party, and the only person he was angry at was the person who blamed Scottish Labour for the party's UK-wide general election defeat - a reference to Unite leader Len McCluskey.And he said that in many ways Scottish Labour was the ""least modernised part of the Labour movement"" and that he wanted his successor to be elected under a one member, one vote system.Mr Murphy added: ""The Labour Party's problem is not the link with trade unions, or even the relationship with Unite members - far from it. It is the destructive behaviour of one high profile trade unionist.""The leader of the Scottish Labour Party doesn't serve at the grace of Len McCluskey, and the next leader of the UK Labour Party should not be picked by Len McCluskey.""Mr McCluskey has been a vocal critic of Mr Murphy's leadership and opposed his appointment in December when Mr Murphy won the contest to replace Johann Lamont.Jim Murphy laughed and joked with Scottish Labour's sole MP as he made his way down the hotel corridor to announce his resignation.He certainly brought energy and dynamism to his election campaign - but all that achieved was Ian Murray in Edinburgh South.So as Mr Murphy bows out, who could replace him?The deputy leader Kezia Dugdale may want to step up or Neil Findlay could try again after challenging last time. Maybe the party's finance spokeswoman Jackie Baillie thinks her steady hand could steer the ship.Jenny Marra is also often talked about as future face of the party.Whoever steps into Jim Murphy's red shoes he or she will have to face a difficult 2016 Holyrood election, to put it mildly.There are also more fundamental questions about how the party can possibly move on as it faces a surging SNP.Mr Murphy was very much a creature of ""New Labour"" - but to today's generation that's old Labour.Party members may start looking for someone with no links to the past, neither a Brownite nor a Blairite. A 'cleanskin' - as the politicos put it - may well help re-connect with voters.That's a long way from now though - even some of the party's opponents may view this latest train wreck with a modicum of sympathy. Ms Lamont had resigned after claiming Scottish Labour was treated like a ""branch office"" by the London-based party leadership.Mr Murphy concluded his speech by saying: ""Scotland needs a strong Labour party; Scotland needs a united Labour party. We have been the greatest force for change in our nation's remarkable history. ""The Scottish Labour party will rise again. It will be under someone else's leadership and I am confident about my party's future.""Harriet Harman MP, acting leader of the UK Labour Party, said it would be for Scottish Labour to choose a new leader. She added: ""As a cabinet minister and leader of his party in Scotland, Jim has been a hugely important figure in the Labour Party. He leaves with the best wishes and thanks of our movement.""Labour peer Lord McConnell, a former Scottish first minister, said the party's problems were ""much deeper than one individual and one affiliate"".He said: ""We have a disconnect locally and nationally with wider Scottish society. ""We have a problem with our political positioning in the post devolution age where the party particularly at the UK level has never been comfortable with success in the Scottish parliament and has always tried to see things through a UK prism rather than a Scottish prism.""We need to find a new generation, a new leader, new generation, new ideas, a fresh approach.""In a tweet, Scottish first minister and SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said: ""I wish Jim Murphy all the very best for the future. Leadership is not easy and he deserves credit for standing up for what he believes in.""Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson also reacted on Twitter, saying: ""Jim Murphy announces a managed exit in order to help the party, which is to his credit. But leaves a tough gig for whoever comes next.""The meeting of Scottish Labour's executive was disrupted by protesters who entered the party's headquarters.Police were called and the protesters, who included persistent anti-austerity activists Sean Clerkin and Piers Doughty-Brown, left the building to protest further from the street outside.The protesters were calling for Mr Murphy to remain as leader to ""finish the job of destroying Scottish Labour"".A Police Scotland spokeswoman said officers had been called and found two protestors on the third floor of the building. She added: ""Both left on police arrival. Advice and assistance was given."""
2015-05-05,Labour contenders clash on spending,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32761561,"Prospective Labour leaders have clashed over Labour's record in government in their first public debate in the race to succeed Ed Miliband.Former cabinet ministers including Yvette Cooper and Andy Burnham defended Labour's fiscal record and spending on schools and hospitals.However, candidates from the 2010 intake of MPs argued that the party spent too much while in office.The debate followed Chuka Umunna's withdrawal from the leadership contest.The remaining candidates appeared at the annual conference of the Progress think tank in London.There was agreement that Labour needed to demonstrate economic credibility to regain power, with shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt telling the meeting that the party needed to be ""trusted with public finances and the family finances"".Mr Hunt, who was first elected to Parliament in 2010 when Labour lost power, argued the last Labour government ""spent too much"" and failed to ""leave enough economic headroom to deal with the economic crisis and the recession"".Shadow health minister Liz Kendall said: ""There's absolutely nothing progressive about spending more on debt interest payments than on educating our children.""But shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: ""The Tories have had a triumph of spin over the facts in saying what they said about the economic record of the last Labour government.""The former chief secretary to the Treasury said the deficit did ""grow too large"" in the government's later years but insisted: ""The last Labour government ran more surpluses in its first term than the Tories did in 18 years.""Yvette Cooper, another former chief secretary to the Treasury, said: ""We should never let anybody tell us that it was too many teachers, doctors or nurses that caused Lehman Brothers bank in New York to crash.""Shadow international development secretary Mary Creagh said: ""People have forgotten the economic credibility that the last Labour government had.""She said Labour had built schools and hospitals that were ""treasured in our communities"".Ms Cooper, Mr Burnham, Ms Kendall and Ms Creagh have declared their intention to run for leader, while Mr Hunt told the conference he would make an announcement next week.At the same event, shadow energy secretary Caroline Flint announced she would be running for deputy leader.The Don Valley MP told the Today programme ahead of the debate that Labour lost the election because ""fundamentally the public did not trust us on the economy"".Exeter MP Ben Bradshaw has already announced a bid to be deputy, saying Labour ""must and could win the next election"", but only if it ""broadens its appeal by adopting sensible, centre-left politics which celebrate wealth creation and entrepreneurship"".Former Labour campaign co-ordinator Tom Watson is reported to be crowd-funding a deputy leadership bid, while Walthamstow MP Stella Creasy has said she is ""open to the question"" of running.Barnsley East MP and shadow transport secretary Michael Dugher - a fierce critic of Ed Miliband's election campaign - is to run Mr Burnham's campaign, according to the website LabourList.It is reported that Mr Burnham also has the backing of Labour peer Lord Falconer, who was lord chancellor and justice secretary under Tony Blair and was close to the former PM.Shadow culture secretary Chris Bryant has signalled his backing for Ms Cooper, tweeting that the next leader must be ""someone who's been tried in the fiery furnace of public opinion"".Mr Hunt said on Friday he would be be attending the debate - along with the other four hopefuls - to ""set out my analysis on how we begin to understand what went so wrong and why"".He added: ""We must use this leadership election to ask some very profound questions.""All voices in the party must be heard so that we can have a full and proper assessment as to why the politics of nationalism triumphed in Scotland and huge swathes of England, and how we have allowed the Conservative Party to present a more compelling vision for Britain to so many millions of people.""Speculation still surrounds shadow business secretary Mr Umunna's decision to pull out on Friday, when he said he was not ""comfortable"" with the ""pressure"" of being a candidate.As well as citing extensive pressure and scrutiny Mr Umunna also said he was ruling himself out because of concerns about the impact of the bid on his family.A rising star of the party, Mr Umunna was first elected to Parliament in 2010 - alongside Tristram Hunt and Liz Kendall - before joining the shadow cabinet.Asked about the candidate who might win, Conservative Chancellor George Osborne said: ""The Labour leadership contest has descended into farce.""But it's not actually about personalities. I don't think the Labour Party any more represents the working people of this country who aspire to a better life."""

I'm not suggesting he takes a break from being leader.""Clearly the national executive has the authority, they're the ruling body. ""I'm told that they made a decision. I'm told it was a procedurally correct decision, he is the leader but I think it's important that as leader he takes a break and I think it's important that we work out how these complex questions are answered by a team.""No one person has all the answers. I'm particularly concerned about tone, making sure we get a tone that ensures that the 27 million people who didn't vote for UKIP last week may be persuaded to vote for us in future.""The party has been beset by wrangling since Mr Farage agreed to stay on as leader, days after standing down after failing to get elected in Thanet South.He had pledged before the general election that he would quit the post if he failed to get elected to Parliament.Senior aide Matthew Richardson has left the party, following claims from MEP Patrick O'Flynn that Mr Farage had fallen under the influence of ""inexperienced"" advisers.UKIP has also confirmed the departure of Mr Farage's chief of staff Raheem Kassam.Mr Farage ruled out quitting as leader on BBC's Question Time on Thursday, saying he had ""phenomenal"" support, and has challenged his critics to decide whether they want to stay in the party.In his article, Mr Carswell had said that ""knowing how difficult it is to lead a party makes me admire Nigel Farage all the more"".""I know that I never could,"" he added, stressing that he would find it ""impossible to simultaneously lead UKIP, be the voice of the party in the Commons, represent my Clacton constituents and at the same time be a husband and a dad"".However, he said that ""even leaders need to take a break"", adding: ""Nigel needs to take a break now.""UKIP got nearly four million votes at the election, but returned only one MP - former Conservative Mr Carswell in the Clacton constituency."
2015-05-05,Coasting schools 'must improve',https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/education-32763097,"Education Secretary Nicky Morgan has said new powers to sack head teachers in coasting schools will show ""it is not OK to be just above the level of failing"". Under the plans, ministers could force schools rated as ""requiring improvement"" and missing new government benchmarks to become an academy.Coasting schools have average results which have often flatlined over time.Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, Mrs Morgan said faster action was needed.She said: ""Our big priorities will be to speed up the process for tackling failing schools; extend our academies programme to tackle 'coasting' schools; and deliver on our commitment to open new free schools.""The proposals will be in a new bill due to be introduced in the Queen's Speech. ""First, we will take new powers to step in from the moment that a school is found to be failing,"" Mrs Morgan said.""From day one, regional schools commissioners will be able to bring in new leadership and support from other excellent schools and heads, and we will speed up the process of turning schools into academies to make sure that new expert leadership is found for all schools that need it as quickly as possible.""She said that coasting schools will be put on an immediate notice to improve and could then be taken over and turned into an academy.They will be required to work with a team of ""expert"" head teachers.She said: ""Those that aren't able to demonstrate a clear plan for improvement will be given new leadership - we know this works in turning schools around.""More than 3,300 schools in England are labelled ""requires improvement"", but the plans are unlikely to cover that many schools.Under the current system, secondary schools are considered to be failing, and therefore eligible for intervention, if fewer than 40% of their students score at least five Cs at GCSE, including English and maths, and they do not meet national averages in pupil progress.In primary schools, the threshold for intervention is if fewer than 65% of pupils get Level 4 in reading, writing and maths and a below average number of pupils make the expected amount of progress.It is not yet clear how coasting schools will be deemed in need of intervention.It is understood that a new category will be devised covering schools which are rated as ""requires improvement"" and which fail to meet a new set of standards on improvement."
2015-05-05,Co-op Group to keep political funding,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-32762858,"The Co-operative Group has decided to continue financially supporting the Co-operative Party, which has strong ties to Labour.Members of the group, the UK's biggest mutual organisation, voted on the issue at their annual general meeting.They passed a motion by 48,579 for, to 39,479 against, to approve ""political expenditures"" of up to £1m which support the movement's objectives.Last year the Co-op Group gave £625,000 to the Co-op Party.This figure was down on the sums donated in previous years. The AGM also included a vote on new corporate governance procedures which would mean members having less of a direct say.The Co-operative Group is still recovering from a period of financial mismanagement and some members have recently expressed concerns about how elections to the board are chosen.The banking arm of the group came close to collapse in 2013, bringing the whole group to a £2.5bn annual loss that year. The Co-op Party includes among its members a number of Labour MPs, including shadow chancellor Chris Leslie and Walthamstow MP Stella Creasy. The politicians stand as candidates of both the Co-operative Party and the Labour Party, and the two political movements have strong historical ties. The board asked the members of the Co-operative Group whether they wanted to continue financially supporting the Co-operative Party, or any other party. Allan Leighton, chairman of the Co-op Group, said: ""There's a clear remit from the members to continue to support the Labour Party.""It allows us to now have a conversation with the Co-op Labour Party about what we do next.""There was also a members' motion on the agenda, put forward by those in favour of making political donations of up to £1m a year.The motion to approve political funding ""not to exceed £1m per annum"" was carried by 55.17% to 44.83%.BBC business correspondent Joe Lynam said: ""To meet a £1.5bn hole in its accounts - mostly stemming from its banking division - the Co-op Group has had to sell off parts of its businesses and hand over majority control of its bank to American hedge funds.""It's also in the process of radically changing the way it runs itself into a more corporate structure with less of a direct say by its members.""He said that ""in theory"", each of the 2.8 million Co-op members could vote on a series of motions about the reforms, as well as how its bosses are paid, and retaining the links to the Co-operative party.One of the group's largest independent societies, Midcounties, recently threatened legal action over a shortlist of six candidates for the group's board being reduced to three - the number of positions available - before a member vote.

2015-05-05,Osborne plans July 'stability' Budget,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32761566,"Chancellor George Osborne has said that he will deliver a new Budget on 8 July.He claimed it would have ""a laser-like focus"" on raising productivity and living standards.He said he was making the unusual move of having a second Budget in one year in order to ""deliver on the commitments we have made to working people"".Labour said the chancellor would have to set out ""who is going to pay"" for what it called ""uncosted promises"" in the election campaign.Speaking outside 11 Downing Street, the chancellor gave a broad outline of his plans for the forthcoming Budget but refused to be drawn on the details, including the Conservatives' planned £12bn of welfare cuts.""I don't want to wait to deliver on the commitments we have made to working people,"" he said.""It will continue with the balanced plan we have to deal with our debts, invest in our health service and reform welfare to make work pay.""But there will also be a laser-like focus on making our economy more productive so we raise living standards across our country.""We're going to put Britain into good shape for the long term.""The last Budget was held on 18 March and included tax cuts for first-time house buyers.Writing in the Sun, Mr Osborne admitted it was ""unusual"" to have two Budgets in the same year, but he wanted to turn ""promises made in the election into a reality"".Again, Mr Osborne did not specifically outline how the Conservatives plan to fulfil a pledge to cut £12bn in welfare spending but said he wants to make the welfare system ""fair for the people who pay for it"".He writes: ""We will protect the NHS and give it more funding each and every year, while making savings across Whitehall. ""We'll crack down hard on tax avoidance and aggressive tax planning by the rich - because everyone should pay their fair share.  ""We will always protect the most vulnerable, but we also need a welfare system that's fair to the people who pay for it. If you can work you should be working, so we'll take the next steps in our benefit reforms to make sure that happens.""Second, we've got to go on helping businesses create jobs in Britain, so we move towards full employment. That means facing a hard truth: in Britain we produce about a quarter less for every hour we work than countries like America or Germany. Fixing that long-running productivity weakness is the big challenge for the next five years.""So in the Budget we'll spend less on welfare, and instead invest to create three million more apprenticeships, so that young people can learn a trade, get better jobs and earn more.""After the Budget in March independent forecaster the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said that Mr Osborne needed to spell out exactly how he plans to cut £12bn from welfare spending.Of those £12bn planned cuts, £2bn were outlined ahead of the general election - all the cuts are supposed to be in place by 2017-18.Labour's shadow energy and climate change secretary, Caroline Flint, accused the Tories of making ""a number of uncosted promises"" during the election campaign.She told the BBC: ""It will be interesting to see who is going to pay for those uncosted policies when they bring the Budget in July."""

If it isn't, stop it and do something else.""He also criticised Mr Farage's comments about HIV patients during the TV leaders' debate last month.While debating about the NHS, Mr Farage said: ""You can come into Britain from anywhere in the world and get diagnosed with HIV and get the retro-viral drugs that cost up to £25,000 per year per patient.""Mr Carswell wrote: ""By all means we should highlight the problem of health tourism. But we need to admit that using the example of HIV patients to make the point was ill-advised.""He said the party needed to strike ""the right tone"" and added: ""UKIP has been at its most persuasive when we have been most optimistic.""Anger is never a great way to motivate people - at least not for very long.""The party has been beset by wrangling since Mr Farage agreed to stay on as leader, days after standing down after failing to get elected in Thanet South.He had pledged before the general election that he would quit the post if he failed to get elected to Parliament.Matthew Richardson has left the party, following claims from MEP Patrick O'Flynn that Mr Farage had fallen under the influence of ""inexperienced"" advisers.

They absolutely loved how he helped them and he was a highly-regarded local MP,"" Mr Bone said.""He stood up for what was right rather than what the party line was. In those days - the John Major years - it was much more difficult to stand up against the party machine. He had strong views on Europe.""Sir Peter started his career as an insurance broker, joining the Wycombe Young Conservatives in 1949 and the Oxford University Conservative Association in 1951.He went on to become a Conservative councillor on Buckinghamshire County Council between 1961 and 1967.Wellingborough mayor-elect Barry Graves also paid tribute to Sir Peter, remembering him as a ""very strong constituency MP"".""I remember going out and canvassing with him and he would go everywhere. He knew the area and the people. He was very much a man of the local constituency.""He was ""a very approachable man"", Mr Graves added.Sir Peter was knighted in 1994. "

2015-05-05,PM will 'look at' powers proposals,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32746049,"David Cameron has said he would ""look at"" any proposals for further powers for Scotland but wants to get the Smith Commission plans implemented first.The prime minister was speaking after meeting Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon in Edinburgh.Mr Cameron said he made a ""commitment"" to include a devolution bill in the Queen's Speech later this month.Ms Sturgeon argued the Smith Commission proposals were ""a good starting point"" but did not go far enough.The prime minister has pledged to include a bill on devolution in this month's Queen's Speech which would be based on the cross-party Smith Commission agreement. The Smith proposals included giving Holyrood the power to set income tax rates and bands, as well as control over a share of VAT and some welfare benefits. But Ms Sturgeon's SNP also wants the Scottish Parliament to be given powers over business taxes, employment law, the minimum wage and additional powers over welfare.Speaking after meeting Ms Sturgeon, Mr Cameron told the BBC: ""Let's make sure Smith is implemented in full. I'm going to keep the commitment I made to the people of Scotland. Let's get that done first because it does create a really strong Scottish Parliament.""He added: ""Of course, if people want to make future proposals I'll look at them.""The prime minister again said he did not support full fiscal autonomy for Scotland - the responsibility for all areas of tax and spending except defence and foreign affairs - stating that it would mean £7bn of cuts or extra tax-raising.What Nicola Sturgeon is trying to say is she has a mandate. She has 56 out of the 59 MPs elected in Scotland and she won 50% of the vote - unprecedented here in Scotland.She says that gives her leverage to push David Cameron. David Cameron says he wants to keep the nation together.The language coming out of Westminster last week was very much a cordial one. 'We will listen'.Nicola Sturgeon has warned him that if he doesn't listen, then the people of Scotland will judge him accordingly.Ms  Sturgeon described the hour-long talks at her official residence at Bute House as ""constructive and business-like"". She said Mr Cameron had made a ""commitment"" that the Smith proposals would be implemented ""as agreed"".""But secondly the prime minister agreed that he would look at proposals that we would now send to suggest the areas we can go beyond Smith,"" Ms Sturgeon said.""There was no agreement in terms of the substance of that but we will submit those proposals, the prime minister has said they will consider them and there will be a meeting to look at how we take that further forward.""Referring to her party's success in last week's general election, which saw the SNP win 56 out of 59 Scottish seats, Ms Sturgeon said: ""People in Scotland have now voted fairly convincingly for the SNP and sent a message that we want the Smith Commission proposals to go further and be built on.""The ball is in his court but I'm going into this in good faith.""She added: ""David Cameron and I are a world apart politically but, where we can, I'm determined to do business in the interests of the people of Scotland and across the UK.""She said she would have a ""constructive and business-like"" relationship with the prime minister. The two leaders shook hands on the front steps of Bute House as Mr Cameron arrived. Mr Cameron left the building shortly before 11:00, almost an hour after he had arrived.The two sides agreed to hold more regular discussions in the future, possibly quarterly. "
2015-05-05,Umunna withdraws Labour leader bid,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32748106,"Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna has withdrawn from the Labour party leadership contest, just days after throwing his hat into the ring.The MP, 36, said in a statement that he was not comfortable with the level of pressure and scrutiny that came with being a leadership candidate.Mr Umunna also cited concerns about the impact of the bid on his family.BBC political editor Nick Robinson said the MP's team insisted no ""unwelcome press story"" lay behind the move.But Mr Umunna had been shocked by the level of scrutiny of himself, his mother, sister and girlfriend, he said.You can follow the latest reaction here.A rising star of the party, Mr Umunna was first elected to Parliament in 2010 before joining the shadow cabinet.He confirmed his candidacy for the Labour leadership via a post on his Facebook page on 12 May, saying the party under Ed Miliband had failed to appeal to enough voters in England.But on Friday he said he had not found the leadership bid to be ""a comfortable experience"".I understand that Chuka Umunna has told friends that ""this is not right for me or people close to me. I'm human, the rest of my life is more important to me than politics.""The shadow business secretary has been distressed by the degree of scrutiny he, his family and his girlfriend have come under since he declared his intention to stand for the labour leadership.I am told that this includes reporters waiting outside the houses of relatives late at night.Friends of Mr Umunna deny that he is nervous of not getting the support of enough MPs to run for the leadership; they point out that he already has half the necessary names and that there are some weeks to go.The shadow business secretary now wants to play a leading role in arguing that Britain should stay in the EU and does not rule out seeking the leadership in the future.He said he thought he had understood ""the scrutiny and attention a leadership contest would bring"", but added: ""However, since the night of our defeat last week I have been subject to the added level of pressure that comes with being a leadership candidate.""The shadow business secretary said he had wondered if it was too soon for him to stand for the leadership, and ""I fear it was."" He also cited concerns about the impact on ""the rest of one's life"" and those close to him.""Consequently, after further reflection, I am withdrawing my candidacy,"" he said.Mr Umunna said he would continue to serve as shadow business secretary and hoped to ""play a leading role"" in Labour's campaign to keep the UK in the EU during the forthcoming in/out referendum.Commenting on the news, Labour former culture secretary Ben Bradshaw - who is expected to run for deputy leader - said Mr Umunna was a ""terrible loss"" to the field.He told the BBC's Daily Politics the Streatham MP had been the candidate the Conservative Party ""feared the most"".""And if it's the result of pressure on an extended family or an extended group of friends, I think that's a very sad reflection on our political culture,"" he said.Chuka Umunna feels ""liberated"", he told me, by his decision to quit the Labour leadership race.He hopes to be given a good role (shadow chancellor, I wonder?) by whoever becomes Labour leader. And I expect he'll become very high profile in the campaign to keep Britain in Europe, which is increasingly looking like it will be next May.He'll endorse a candidate in the next four weeks before nominations close. It will be very interesting to see who he piles in behind.Read more from Allegra (see post 13.23).Former Labour leader Lord Kinnock said he thought Mr Umunna had made the right decision.He said: ""If he felt in his soul that he wasn't prepared to subject himself - and more importantly his family - to the kind of attention which is fairly typical, sadly, these days, he has done absolutely the right thing.""There is no point at all in inflicting avoidable, unnecessary misery on those you love most.""Leadership contender Mary Creagh said she had ""huge respect"" for Mr Umunna, telling BBC Radio 4's World at One programme it took ""courage"" to withdraw from the leadership race.Mr Umunna was ""a big beast"" and would play a ""big role"" in the future of the Labour Party, she added.Yvette Cooper, Andy Burnham, Liz Kendall and Mary Creagh have already thrown their hats into the ring for Labour's top job while a number of other potential candidates, including Dan Jarvis, Alan Johnson and David Lammy, have ruled themselves out. Candidates must secure nominations from 34 colleagues - 15% of the party's MPs - by 15 June to make it on to ballot papers, which will be sent to members in August ahead of the leader's election a month later."

However, Mr Justice Stuart Smith at Southwark Crown Court said there was a ""very strong likelihood"" a custodial sentence would follow.The jury heard how Mote submitted numerous false expenses claims for payment for work that organisations had allegedly carried out on his behalf.Mote claimed the money was to pay whistleblowers in cash through third parties. He also said he had been ""targeted for being an anti-EU MEP.""During his time an MEP he also made £250,000 legitimate expenses claims.No date has been set for the sentencing."

2015-05-05,Round-up: BBC experts' analysis,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/election-2015-32650417,"The political future of the United Kingdom has become clearer after the results of the general election emerged around the country.David Cameron says he hopes to govern for all of the UK after the Conservatives took 331 seats - enough to form a slender majority in the Commons.Labour has been all but wiped out by the SNP in Scotland and suffered a disappointing set of results elsewhere, while the Lib Dems are left with just eight MPs after many party heavyweights such as Vince Cable and Danny Alexander lost their seats.So with battles won and lost and the fall-out and celebrations beginning, BBC correspondents examine the implications and challenges that lie ahead for the new government - and for those whose political careers have been ended by voters.No pollster, no pundit, no political leader saw it coming - not even David Cameron himself.Governing parties don't gain seats. Parties that have implemented painful cuts and are promising more certainly don't. Until that is the Conservative Party did - achieving what had seemed to be Mission Impossible - a Tory majority.Until that is David Cameron's personal triumph which triggered the near simultaneous resignation of his three principle opponents - Messrs Miliband, Clegg and Farage.They did so in part because they helped to crush their partners in coalition these last five years - reducing the Liberal Democrat parliamentary party to a size when it can fit into two London taxis and still have two seats to spare.In part because the extraordinary tidal wave of support for the SNP swept dozens of once safe Labour seats away.In part because Nigel Farage persuaded millions to vote for him but secured just one seat - not, though, the one he was standing in.Read more from Nick Robinson hereThe question uppermost in the prime minister's mind as he assembles his new government is how to keep the kingdom united.""Above all I want to bring our country together,"" he revealed after the result, ""to reclaim a mantle we should never have lost - the mantle of one nation, one United Kingdom"".Looking at the political landscape from Land's End today is very different to the view from John O'Groats.A sea of Conservative and Unionist blue dominates the scene across much of England, while a field of SNP nationalist yellow stretches to the horizon and beyond from the north.David Cameron's greatest challenge is to prevent the union he supports being torn apart by mutual resentment - resentment from Scotland at a Westminster government dominated by English Tories, and resentment from England at the preferential treatment people think is being given to the Scots.Those who assumed the future of the Union had been safeguarded by the Scottish referendum must think again.Read more from Mark Easton hereOne thing is rock-solid true: the Conservatives who worked on this campaign are as surprised by the result as the pollsters, pundits, politicians and general population.Maybe they shouldn't be - the economy is in good shape and the Conservatives had incumbency advantage.But when I travelled back from the prime minister's last rally with a group of exhausted Conservative campaign officials it was clear that 290 seats was a hoped-for target.No-one talked about anything over 300 seats, and no-one even mentioned an overall majority.So what special sauce pushed David Cameron into No 10 with a Commons majority?Mr Cameron had two simple messages in the campaign and he rarely veered away from them; the first - the economy is in good shape and the recovery is threatened by Labour. And the second - the SNP would hold a Labour-led government to ransom.Read more from Jonny Dymond hereBrian Taylor, BBC political editor, ScotlandOf all the comments on the overnight apocalypse, undoubtedly the most straightforward came from a defeated Scottish Labour MP.Since there were quite a few of them, let me narrow the focus a little. Come on down, Tom Harris.Mr Harris had plainly anticipated defeat. Nonetheless, he looked suitably lugubrious as his fate was confirmed.Why, he was asked eagerly, had Labour lost? ""Because we did not win enough votes.""Psephologically, it is perfect. Complete in itself. Psychologically, it sums up Labour's gloom without descending into subsidiary matters such as leadership, strategy and the rest. As a forward-thinking strategy, it is ideal. Win more votes. Simple.Read more from Brian Taylor hereThis has been an election which may have more profound consequences than almost any in living memory.We now face a generational decision about our future in Europe, with an EU referendum in two years' time almost certain.There will also be serious questions about the future of the Union, following an SNP landslide that has turned Scotland into a virtual one-party state.David Cameron's victory also represents a colossal achievement.Only once before in recent history has an incumbent government increased its majority - and that was Mrs Thatcher in her prime in the 1980s.It is also a significant personal victory for Mr Cameron and a rebuff for those in his party who had become increasingly sceptical about his ability to win.But while it may represent a defeat for those Tories who saw this election as a potential opportunity to rid themselves of David Cameron, he must now govern with a wafer-thin majority.For the SNP, their stunning victory can only increase the pressure on Nicola Sturgeon to include a commitment to a second independence referendum in her party's manifesto for next year's Scottish elections.It is an election which has not just defied all the predictions of the pollsters and pundits - but which may yet prompt the most fundamental re-casting of British politics for a generation.Read more from Norman Smith hereAfter an extraordinary night, some brief conclusions:Read more from James Landale hereIs this the end of the union?That is the question many people will be asking this morning after the party which has fought for Scottish independence for 80 years swept to victory.The answer from the jubilant Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon is a firm ""No"".She insists that her MPs will speak for all of Scotland, not just for the 45% who voted for the country to leave the United Kingdom last September.In the closing hours of the most extraordinary election campaign which anyone in Scotland can remember, Ms Sturgeon turned to talk of ""legitimacy.""That will be her watchword in the coming days as she argues that the prime minister cannot ignore the democratic will of the Scottish people.Politically, Scotland and England this morning look and feel like very different countries.Read more from James Cook hereAfter weeks of chatter about an election too close to call, it wasn't that close at all.David Cameron will be continuing as our prime minister.So, what is all this likely to mean?A referendum on whether the UK stays in, or leaves, the European Union, within the next two-and-a-half years.A race to be the next leader of the Labour Party.A race to be the next leader of the Liberal Democrats.And a huge new presence of Scottish National Party MPs at Westminster.And so here's another thing we know for certain this morning: Politics ain't going to be boring any time soon.Read more from Chris Mason hereFor Labour the story of their terrible night is rapidly turning into the search for a new leader. So who will that be?Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, is almost certain to run.  Even before this election, both he and another almost inevitable candidate, Chuka Umunna, had raised eyebrows inside the party at the work they had put in, preparing the ground with members and the unions for potential bids.Yvette Cooper, before the election, was still thought not to have made up her mind over whether to run. That decision has been made perhaps a little easier as her husband, Ed Balls, has lost his seat.She is certainly potentially in the frame, along with two lesser known names - Liz Kendall and Dan Jarvis - two MPs who were only elected in 2010 for the first time. This could be their moment. But whoever is in the job, they face a monumental task.Read Laura Kuenssberg's Twitter hereSterling is up (the most for seven years against the euro), share prices are up (especially bank shares like Lloyds and RBS, and energy shares such as Centrica), government bond prices are up.To state the obvious, investors love the Tories' general election victory.There are a few reasons.One (no surprise here) is that Labour's threat of breaking up banks and imposing energy price caps has been lifted.Second is that investors have been discounting days and weeks of wrangling after polling day over who would form the government - and so they are semi-euphoric that we already know who's in charge.Third, many investors tend to be economically conservative and instinctively Conservative.But although the City may be a bit drunk on the result, its pleasure in Ed Miliband's and Ed Balls' humiliation may be making it a bit blind - perhaps dangerously so - to some bumps in the economic road ahead.Read more from Robert Peston hereNigel Farage dreamed of holding the balance of power, but in the end his UKIP party is now worse off than when it came into the election.At the seventh time of asking he was rejected - this time by the people of Thanet South. It was a similar story in Rochester and Strood where Mark Reckless, who sensationally defected from the Tories last year, was also sent packing.In seats on UKIP's target list, like Thurrock in Essex, the party failed to make gains. In Grimsby - where Mr Farage went twice in the last six weeks - they came third.UKIP got around four million votes - with especially strong showings in north-east and south-east England - but it's ended up with just one MP, and a vacancy at the top. This has led to UKIP attacking the current system of choosing MPs, which it's described as ""busted"" and ""dysfunctional"".In one sense, this campaign was a complete failure and it's left an aftermath of angry voters, and others wondering if the UKIP bubble has burst.Read Robin Brant's Twitter hereI monitored 91 GB-wide voting intention polls during the 2015 election campaign and found nothing in them to prepare me for the final outcome.The good news for the pollsters was that their share for the Lib Dems was pretty close, as were the shares for UKIP, the Greens and the catch-all category of Others.The bad news for the polling industry was that the crucial shares for Conservative and Labour were the ones where they came most adrift.When all the qualifications of margins of error are allowed, there did appear to be a systematic overstatement of the Labour share and an equally systematic understatement of the Conservative one.It is for the pollsters to decide whether to conduct a review of their performance but I trust they will avoid the initial knee-jerk reaction of the immediate aftermath of the 1992 polls debacle.This general election performance follows the performance of the polls in the 2014 Scottish referendum where the choice was simply binary and yet all the polls were out by between 4-6%.Something is wrong. A lot of us would like to know what it is.Read more from David Cowling hereThe words ""political earthquake"" have been translated into numerous European languages, making front page news across the continent.While Britons now examine the domestic minutiae of the election result, here in mainland Europe the vote means one thing: a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU. And that has the potential to create an earthquake of its own.The guardian of the EU treaties Mr Cameron wants to change - Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker - has said again he'd listen to what Britain's new government proposed.Read more from Katya Adler here"

He's not the only party leader to face an attempted ousting. But can you recover from such a revolt?In 2006, the Labour prime minister was the target of what became known as the ""curry house conspiracy"" - a coup to remove him and install his chancellor, Gordon Brown, as prime minister.It would lead to several of the plotters' resignations - but not Mr Blair's. However, it was successful to a degree in that it forced the party leader into naming a departure date.The move against him was reportedly masterminded by Tom Watson, a defence minister at the time, who was also rumoured to have had a secret meeting with Mr Brown on the eve of the revolt.Apparently, Mr Watson and three fellow West Midlands MPs - Sion Simon, David Wright (both ministerial aides) and Khalid Mahmood - met over a biryani at a Wolverhampton curry house to discuss the PM's future, before dispatching a missive calling for him to quit.The letter - which attracted the support of a number of normally loyal Labour MPs - was leaked to the press, and ultimately resulted in Mr Watson's resignation.In his parting letter, the West Bromwich East MP took a shot at the prime minister, who he said should step down in the interests of party and country.Mr Blair denounced his actions and branded the former minister ""disloyal, discourteous and wrong"", saying he would have sacked him if he had not resigned.But Mr Watson's departure was swiftly followed by the resignations of six other junior members of government - who had also signed the rebel letter - in protest at the prime minister's refusal to say when he would step down as Labour leader.The whole affair resulted in Mr Blair announcing his intention to step aside within 12 months - which he duly did, on 27 June 2007.But it did nothing to quash internal dissent and speculation in the party over the future leadership of the party.Labour prime minister Gordon Brown found his leadership under threat in 2009 after one of his cabinet ministers dramatically quit the government and called for him to resign.Work and Pensions Secretary James Purnell - a former aide to Tony Blair - resigned from his post after the polls closed in the local and European elections, in which Labour was forecast to do badly.Explaining his decision to quit, Mr Purnell said the prime minister made a Conservative victory ""more, not less, likely"".It was Mr Brown's first direct challenge from a cabinet minister - but it would not topple the Labour leader as senior members of government refused to follow Mr Purnell's lead.Mr Brown was safe for the time being. But several months later, in January 2010, a fresh leadership challenge was mounted by two senior former Labour cabinet ministers.Geoff Hoon and Patricia Hewitt wrote to all Labour MPs, saying the party was ""deeply divided"" over Mr Brown's leadership and that the best way to resolve the issue was by way of secret ballot.They insisted it was not an ""attempted coup"" but a necessary step to resolve divisions within the party.But the duo could only muster the public support of a handful of backbenchers long-opposed to Mr Brown, with the majority of the party's MPs less than impressed by the move, which came just weeks before the general election.As the day wore on, a succession of cabinet ministers came out to back the PM, suggesting there was little momentum behind the plot - although it was noted that several were not exactly gushing in their support of Mr Brown.As history tells us, neither leadership challenge bore fruit but they reflected the internal doubts and divisions over Mr Brown at the helm.As leadership toppling attempts go, this one in 2014 was regarded as a particularly ""botched"" and ""shambolic coup"". Indeed, former Lib Dem leader Lord (Paddy) Ashdown described the move as a ""plot of deep malice"".Its instigator, Lord (Matthew) Oakeshott - a close ally of the-then Business Secretary Vince Cable - tried to unseat Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg.The peer was found to have commissioned secret polls suggesting the party would do better at the 2015 general election without Mr Clegg in the driving seat.The man Lord Oakeshott had long had in mind to take Mr Clegg's place - Mr Cable, who was on government business in China at the time - was forced to publicly condemn his friend's actions and state his backing for Mr Clegg.But Lord Oakeshott said the business secretary had in fact known about his polls and their findings.Nevertheless, the peer - who was denounced by the Lib Dem leadership for spending money that could have been spent on campaigning - quit the party, and issued a warning shot on his way out about the Lib Dems' future prospects.Mr Cable largely emerged unscathed but he faced questions about his loyalty to the leader. Although the two sought to put paid to reports of a rift with a (painfully awkward, 'nothing to see here, folks') stage-managed pint in a pub.Although the revolt failed, and Mr Clegg remained at the helm, the Lib Dems did go on to suffer a trouncing at the general election, losing nearly 50 of its MPs - one of them, Mr Cable himself - prompting his leader to quit.The Conservatives have a reputation for being more ruthless than their party rivals when it comes to getting rid of leaders they sense are no longer effectual.But, in 1995, Prime Minister John Major - tired of persistent rumours of a leadership challenge - decided to take the bull by the horns and trigger a surprise leadership election to silence his detractors.His own backbenchers had questioned Mr Major's ability to unite and lead the party, which was deeply divided over Europe.So ""put up or shut up"", he told them as he tendered his resignation as Conservative Party leader but not prime minister.But then stepped forward eurosceptic MP John Redwood, who resigned from the cabinet in order to contest Mr Major's leadership.This was unexpected by many, as the PM had said there had been assurances from his cabinet that none would stand against him.But Mr Major went on to win the ensuing election with a comfortable defeat over his challenger, who was not included in the PM's consequent cabinet reshuffle.No further contested leadership election took place until after the Conservatives' defeat at the 1997 general election, paving the way for William Hague to take over the running of the party.Not all attempts to oust a party leader end in failure: as Margaret Thatcher found out to her peril.With three electoral victories under her belt, the Conservative prime minister's downfall would come at the hands of her own party - not the voters.It was on 1 November 1990 when Geoffrey (now Lord) Howe - one of Mrs Thatcher's longest-serving ministers - resigned over differences with the party leader over Europe.In his now infamous speech on the floor of the House of Commons, he attacked the PM's policies and leadership style, comparing being one of her cabinet ministers to opening the batting at cricket only to find his bat had been ""broken... by the team captain"".It sparked the beginning of the end of the 11-year Thatcher reign.Michael (now Lord) Heseltine seized on the opportunity to challenge the prime minister in the ensuing leadership contest, from which she would eventually withdraw and John Major emerge as her successor. Reflecting on the revolt and its implications on the Conservative Party, Baroness Thatcher's biographer Charles Moore wrote: ""Because the coup was unjustified, and so trust broke down, the politics of the next 15 years were those of civil war."""
2015-05-05,Election swings and roundabouts,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-32741924,"If election manifesto claims are all about smoke and mirrors, should we now add swings and roundabouts to the political metaphor?There's an intriguing aspect to the general election results in the Midlands that puzzled me.It's the striking contrast in the swings between Labour and the Conservatives.David Cameron and his campaign strategists knew they were home and dry when Nuneaton was the first Midlands marginal to declare.It was not only a Tory hold but a swing to the Conservatives from Labour of 3%.I was in the Nottingham suburb of Beeston awaiting the result of the Broxtowe count. Would its high profile Conservative MP Anna Soubry survive a red surge?Nuneaton set the pattern. Across the Midlands, both east and west, there was a uniform swing of between three and four per cent to the Tories - Warwickshire North 3%, Amber Valley 4%, Derbyshire South 4% and Sherwood 4%. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan topped the Tory swingometer in the Midlands marginals with 5% in Loughborough.Yet in the big cities, it was a very different story. The swing went to Labour.So in Nottingham East they enjoyed a 6% swing, Nottingham South 5.8%, Leicester South 7.3%, Leicester West 5%, Birmingham Hall Green 12%, Birmingham Hodge Hill 8%.If swings to Labour on this scale had gone beyond the city ring road roundabouts and into the suburbs, Ed Miliband would have become prime minister by now.In confidence, one senior Labour insider in Nottingham told me its success in the city wards was down to organisation, experience and its teams of activists.""We won the ground war. If Nottingham's city boundaries were extended into Sherwood and Broxtowe, we would have won those constituencies as well,"" he told me.Labour leadership candidate, Leicester West's Liz Kendall has identified her party's problem beyond the ring road roundabout.It's about reaching out to Middle England.""We need to show people that we understand their aspirations and ambitions for the future,"" she told the Sunday Times.The problem for Labour was that Middle England was not interested in what the party offered…and still isn't. The Cameron brand worked its magic in those Midlands marginals... it'll take something or someone special to break up that ballot box relationship."
2015-05-05,Royal 'lobbying',https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32740154,"Prince Charles sent 27 letters to then Prime Minister Tony Blair and members of his government between September 2004 and March 2005, ""despite the Freedom of Information Act!"" as the prince joked in one.But did his suggestions and concerns have any bearing on the behaviour of Mr Blair's government?The request: Prince Charles expresses his worries over an EU directive on complementary medicines ""which is… effectively outlawing the use of certain herbal extracts"".  Mr Blair replied, offering moral support and practical help. He agreed that ""the implementation as it is currently planned is crazy"" and set out an action plan that included delaying implementation for all existing products to 2011. What happened: Herbal products were not required to be authorised until 2011, just as Mr Blair had promised. Prince Charles continues to sell his own brand of complementary products, Duchy Herbals, through Boots and Waitrose. The request: Writing to Mr Blair, the prince expresses a ""growing sense of anxiety"" that the Hill Farming Allowance, which supports farmers working on Britain's uplands, could be scrapped. In his reply, the prime minister said he understood that the Hill Farm Allowance would continue until 2007. What happened: The allowance lasted until the end of Labour's tenure in 2010, when it was abolished.The request: Just 18 months after the US-led invasion of Iraq, Prince Charles raised the issue of poor performance of Lynx helicopters in high temperatures, saying: ""I fear that this is just one more example of where our Armed Forces are being asked to do an extremely challenging job (particularly in Iraq) without the necessary resources.""Mr Blair replied: ""On the subject of the Lynx helicopter, the limitations of the existing platform, particularly in the extremely challenging environment within Iraq, are well recognised by the Ministry of Defence."" He added that replacement of the helicopters would be a priority. What happened: Mr Blair's comments go much further than what he was saying about the subject at the time. In the event, though, the fleet was not fully upgraded until 2011.The request: Prince Charles lamented that the government's TB prevention plans might not ""include a commitment to deal with the badger problem in the immediate future"" and pushed strongly for a cull, saying: ""All I can say is that I do urge you to look again at introducing a proper cull of badgers where it is necessary.""Mr Blair sympathised, saying he could ""personally see the case for culling badgers"". However, he was unwilling to commit to a cull.  What happened: Culling trials were conducted from 1998-2005. The final results, published in 2008, said that the badger cull could ""make no meaningful contribution"" to curbing bovine TB. It wasn't until 2013 that a full culling programme began in two pilot areas. These ended with the conclusion that the pilots had been neither humane nor effective at curbing the spread of TB.The request: Then Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell wrote to Prince Charles to say she had decided to give parts of the historic Smithfield meat market Grade II listed status, and was trying to persuade deputy prime minister John Prescott to ""call in"" the planning application to prevent demolition of other parts of the site. She had been swayed by evidence provided by Sir Neil Cossons, who was English Heritage chair at the time, after he had been asked by the prince to add his support. Prince Charles replied that he was ""extremely glad to read of your appreciation of the value of this group of buildings"". According to the Guardian, market workers desperate to see the redevelopment of the site invited the prince to meet them to discuss it, but his office said he was ""unlikely to accept as he did not want to interfere in the planning process"".What happened: Smithfield market is still the subject of planning battles a decade on. Successive planning applications have been refused by ministers. Last year then Communities Secretary Eric Pickles rejected plans for an office development on the site, stating that ""the extent of damage that the application would cause to the important heritage assets at Smithfield runs entirely counter to national and policy objectives intended to protect such assets from harm"".In March, the Museum of London announced a move from its current Barbican site to the Smithfield market building."
2015-05-05,Election fallout,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32703139,"""Some of those gimmicks - that tombstone, whatever idiot thought that up I do not know!""I was talking to the former Mayor of Crawley in Sussex, John Mortimer, in the town's Labour Supporters Club about the vexed question of what went wrong, and where Labour should go next. This seat is one of those southern seats Labour hoped to take, but failed.I hear a whole range of views in the club.""They didn't give nothing to depend on, they should be clear, and a little bit more down to Earth."" ""Good party, wrong leader, they don't look after business enough.""Councillor John Stanley tells me: ""I think in a way we did go too left, but now we can go a bit centre-left, or centre, depending who the new leader is.""The former mayor sums up the mood on the doorstep: ""Whatever we told them, they didn't believe us.""  Expect to hear all those views, and more, in the coming leadership contest. Step back from the angst of supporters, and it may not be that hard to see why Labour failed.  An economic recovery, hailed by independent organisations as the result of government policy, undid a party that had loudly proclaimed for five years that the coalition's policies would lead to economic disaster. Combine that with an uncharismatic and uninspirational leader, then you might argue no further debate is necessary.Fat chance of that. Defeat breeds resentment, and this one has opened up old divisions.  A chorus of Blairties, led by the man himself, has declared that Ed's problem was ignoring those with aspiration and ambition, failing to appeal to those running business. Incidentally, I've been ticked off by the perspicacious editor of the New Statesman, Jason Cowley, for using the ""unhelpful"" term ""Blairites"".I can't think of another description that fits Tony, Lord Mandelson, Lord Adonis and David Miliband quite so well. But call them what you will, the message was clear - Ed was too left wing, Labour should move back to the centre, or, if you like, to the right.Reading Mr Blair's pithy analysis, listening to Lord Mandelson's gripping and savage eloquence, describing a party sent out to shout: ""We love the poor and hate the rich,"" and so ignoring the middle, and you realise strong emotions are in play.But back to the future may not be sufficient. Of course elections are won on the centre ground. But grandees grinding axes, affronted by the failure of boys who used to make their tea, may be creating so much noise that they can't hear more insistent sounds.  For there are several elephants trumpeting loudly as they cram into the small space of the shadow cabinet room. Imagine these beasts are as gaily decorated as Berlin buddy bears. One is decked out in red, another in imperial purple bunting, and another, a mammoth, strong tusked and ice rimmed, painted yellow with tartan trimmings.Take the last first. The Scottish wipeout is Labour's biggest problem. Fail to solve it, and Labour can forget ever having a comfortable majority again. It is hard to argue Labour were wiped out in Scotland because the SNP outflanked them to the right with their appeal to the business community and the ambitious and aspirational. But it is true the SNP drew in to people from left, right and centre, just as the modernisers say Labour should. It was the politics of economic self-interest, but cast in a very different light. Tribally sneering at ""the reactionary ideology of nationalism"" as Mr Blair does, will not reach the central belt of Scotland, the middle ground of  Midlothian.What about that purple pachyderm?  In Crawley - in fact in seat after seat - there is a similar pattern.  Labour did, in fact, often increase the size of their vote. So did the Conservatives, usually by a bit more. But the real dynamic was the total collapse of the Lib Dems and the dramatic rise of UKIP. The increase in votes for Nigel Farage's party wasn't translated into parliamentary seats, but, although it is early days in terms of research, it probably hurt Labour a lot. If we believe - and I do - Matthew Goodwin and Rob Ford, authors of Revolt on the Right, these voters are often former Labour supporters - older, less educated, those left behind on the tides of  globalisation, stranded on the shores of post-industrialisation. They may have had too many disappointments to feel much ambition or aspiration. They are a challenge for Labour, and any new leader will spend a good deal of time thinking how to deal with the concerns of Europe and immigration.Whether to share their fears, or confront them will be a big decision.Which brings us to Red Nellie. Those members who still proudly call themselves socialist. This is not about Old Labour - they are more likely to be baristas or barristers than boilermakers. It is easy as an outsider, as a journalist, to treat politics as an intellectual game about how best to win power - but many people, particularly the foot soldiers, particularly after the death of  purely tribal loyalties, are in it because they passionately believe in winning  power to do something specific.Many of them are suspicious of the later incarnations of New Labour, not because it reached an accommodation with wealth and business, but because it seemed to worship at the same altar, to regard the party's core beliefs in redistribution and equality as childish fantasies from a past age.Perhaps to Mr Blair, they are the problem, people who may equate ""ambition"" with greed. They might point out that a man who claims to be worth ""only"" £20m may find it harder than most to squeeze through the eye of a needle to understand their point of view. Most successful Labour leaders will confront the left at some point, but the concerns of this group go to the existential question ""What is the party for?""This is not a polemic - not an argument about what should be done, but a reflection on the complex conundrums that will face any new Labour leader, the tearing apart of the old alliance that made up a Labour majority, and so the political need to satisfy groups with very different, indeed, contradictory demands. But looking for a Social Democratic universal theory of everything may be missing the point. What the party desperately wants is a leader who can pull the disparate threads together and articulate them as common purpose. Whether she or he exists is another matter.Much more on that in the coming months."
2015-05-05,'Take us with you',https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-32736153,"Thousands of people in the north of England have been using the hashtag ""take us with you Scotland"" to express their upset about the result of last week's general election, and Scottish nationalists are welcoming this English minority with open arms. Last Thursday's general election was a rough one for the Labour Party in its traditional stronghold in the north of England. But further to the north, the left-leaning Scottish National Party won nearly every seat it contested. That political contrast has made some left-wing voters in places like Manchester, Leeds and Sheffield look fondly on their neighbours. Since last Thursday's election in Britain the phrase ""take us with you Scotland"" has been used more than 24,000 times. ""Genuinely beginning to wonder if the North of England becoming a part of Scotland would be better for us, I really am,"" tweeted Aaron Miller from Yorkshire. Some cracked jokes under the tag after the North West Motorway Police account, which gives traffic updates, announced that they had ""picked up a pedestrian on the M62 who was trying to walk to Scotland.""After an initial spike of jokes over the weekend, the hashtag really took off when users start to mobilise in support of around a year-old petition on the campaigning site Change.org. The petition calls for the north of England to secede from the rest of the country and join up with Scotland, and more than 12,000 people have signed it.Its creator, a Sheffield resident who calls himself ""Stu Dent"", set it up to coincide with last year's Scottish independence referendum, and he also created a map imagining the boundary of a ""Scotland plus the north"" country.Stu Dent runs the Twitter account Hunters Bar, named after an area of southwest Sheffield which is very popular with - you guessed it - students. Despite the account having thousands of followers on Twitter, when the map was first posted last year, the image was shared only about 100 times - however, in the past week it's been retweeted by thousands. Stu Dent told BBC Trending that he was surprised at how popular his idea has become. ""In hindsight, perhaps I shouldn't have been,"" he said. ""There is a huge frustration in parts of the UK about the things that have happened since 2010.""""I think people need a place to go where they can say 'not in my name! This is not the England I want',"" he added. But in addition to disappointment from some quarters about the election result, there might be another reason why the petition is getting a boost now: the power of the Scottish Nationalists on Twitter. What started as a post-election joke in the North of England was quickly embraced by the so-called ""Cyber Nats"" - and a trend was born.The SNP's social media strategist Ross Colquhoun expressed the party's mood about the hashtag best, in a post which was shared more than 500 times. ""2014: #LetsStayTogether 2015: #TakeUsWithYouScotland What a difference a year makes"" he tweeted.Blog by Hannah HendersonNext story: The sport reporter and the obscene ranter who lost his jobFollow BBC Trending on Twitter @BBCtrending, and find us on Facebook."
2015-05-05,What Britain wants from Europe,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32695399,"David Cameron says he has a mandate to pursue EU reform following the Conservatives' general election victory. The PM, who will be hoping his majority government will give him extra leverage in Brussels, wants to renegotiate the terms of the UK's membership ahead of a referendum by the end of 2017. He has said he will campaign for Britain to remain in the EU if he gets the reforms he wants.Mr Cameron has said he does not want to reveal full details of his negotiating hand but he has given a broad indication, in a series of speeches and newspaper articles, of his priorities when he goes into talks with other EU leaders.These are: The prime minister has said Britain would resist any move towards a European Army and that he wants to free British police forces from EU interference. He has also ruled out Britain joining the euro.But he has placed less emphasis in recent years on demanding changes to EU social policy, such as the maximum 48-hour working week, agency workers, maternity leave and non-discrimination rules.The official UK government position is that a referendum will be held by the end of 2017 but Downing Street sources have said: ""If we can do it earlier we will.""There is speculation David Cameron is planning to hold the vote in 2016 to avoid a clash with French and German elections in 2017.The prime minister wants treaty change but even if the referendum was held in 2017 there may not be enough time to legally incorporate any reforms into a treaty and it would have to be done at a later stage.An early referendum would anger Eurosceptics who believe it would not allow enough time to make the case for exit or negotiate any meaningful concessions.""A rushed process would severely undermine the chances to secure a significant deal that both British business and voters could support and would waste the opportunity of a lifetime,"" Matthew Elliott, chief executive of Business for Britain told Breitbart London.The question is always crucial in any referendum and there is already a debate about what it should be. The Draft European Union (Referendum) Bill, published by the Conservatives in 2013, proposed this form of words: ""Do you think that the United Kingdom should remain a member of the European Union?""Some thought that leaned too far towards the status quo, encouraging a yes vote, and the Electoral Commission said it was not clear and direct enough. The watchdog proposed this form of words instead: ""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union?""The new Conservative government will attempt to repeal the Human Rights Act, which requires UK courts to treat the European Court of Human Rights as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. The European Court of Human Rights is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe (CoE), which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine.The freedom for people to move around Europe, enshrined in the EU treaties, works in parallel with the other three basic freedoms in the single market: freedom of goods, capital and services.It is likely to be a ""red line"" for other EU leaders, who do not want to see it eroded.Mr Cameron has steered clear of tackling it directly - for example by asking for an emergency ""brake"" on free movement, or a cap on numbers - focusing instead on reducing the incentive provided by welfare payments. In a speech last November, David Cameron set out measures to reduce the number of EU nationals moving to the UK.His main proposals were:Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission, has said he is ready to work with Mr Cameron to ""strike a fair deal for the United Kingdom in the EU"". The leaders of other EU nations have previously warned they are unlikely to support major changes to EU treaties to accommodate British demands. But Mr Cameron's general election victory may have given him extra leverage. ""The ball is very much in the court of the UK now,"" a senior EU official told The Guardian. ""It's up to the British to define what they want."" The key figure will be German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is very keen to keep Britain in the EU but has so far been unwilling to make major concessions to enable that to happen. There are fears that a ""pick and mix"" approach to EU treaties would undermine EU cohesion.Mr Cameron has said there is ""no doubt"" his planned reforms will require changes to the treaties governing the European Union. But this would require the unanimous support of all EU members, and may not be possible within the deadline he has set of a referendum before the end of 2017. Any attempt to change EU laws on free movement would meet fierce resistance from some EU nations, particularly Eastern European states. Mr Juncker has said free movement is non-negotiable.Mr Cameron may find it difficult to get unanimous support for his proposals for a four-year waiting period for migrant workers claiming UK benefits. East European EU members would be likely to oppose this, on the grounds that it would discriminate against their citizens.  Attempts to secure opt-outs for the City are unlikely to go down well with other European leaders.However, there are precedents for EU treaty changes to accommodate some countries' specific concerns - for example, the protocol attached to the Lisbon Treaty for Ireland.Mr Cameron has faced repeated calls to say whether he would campaign for Britain's exit from the EU in the referendum if he fails to get what he wants from the renegotiation process. All he has said is that he will ""rule nothing out"". Some Conservative MPs want Britain to leave the EU no matter what David Cameron manages to renegotiate. A larger group are likely to want more concessions than Mr Cameron has so far indicated he is prepared to demand.Senior backbencher David Davis, who was defeated by Mr Cameron for the Tory leadership in 2005, told the Daily Telegraph the majority of the 332 Conservative MPs want Mr Cameron to negotiate an ""opt-out"" power to stop individual EU laws from applying to Britain. The prime minister has said this would be ""impossible"" without Britain leaving the EU.Mr Davis claims as many as 60 Tory MPs would be prepared to rebel and vote for Britain's exit from the EU if the prime minister fails to deliver.Graham Brady, chairman of the Tory backbench 1922 committee, which represents backbenchers, has urged David Cameron to give all Conservative MPs, including ministers, a free vote in the EU referendum.In January, Mr Cameron warned that serving cabinet ministers would have to quit the government if they wanted to campaign to leave the EU if he had secured the reforms to it he wants.In the 1975 referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Economic Community, as the EU was then called, Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson decided to suspend collective responsibility because his cabinet was split on the issue. Ministers were allowed to vote with their consciences and campaign against each other. The majority of them, including Mr Wilson, joined the Yes camp, but left-wingers, such as Tony Benn, played a leading role in the No campaign. The Yes campaign won easily with 67% of the vote."

Mr Murphy said he would tender his resignation alongside a plan to reform the party.He lost his seat in last week's general election as the SNP won 56 of the 59 Scottish seats, leaving Labour with a single MP in Scotland.Mr Murphy said he wanted to have a successor as leader in place by the summer, and confirmed he would not be standing for a seat at the Scottish Parliament in next year's election. Instead, he said it was time to ""do something else"" and that he believed the party would continue to be divided if he remained as leader. His deputy, Kezia Dugdale MSP, will become acting leader until a permanent successor is found. Mr Murphy had faced calls to resign from several MSPs, trade unions and former MPs in the wake of his party's near wipeout at the general election.He insisted he had decided to stand down ahead of the national executive voting by 17-14 in favour of him staying in the job.Speaking at a media conference after the national executive meeting, he said: ""It is clear that a small minority who didn't accept my election as leader of the Scottish Labour Party just five months ago won't accept the vote of the executive today and that will continue to divide the party.""Today I received more support in the executive vote than I did from members of the executive when I stood for election five months ago.""He said it would be up to the executive whether to accept the reforms he would be proposing before he left the post. But he warned: ""A party in such urgent need of reform blocks those changes at its peril.""The former East Renfrewshire MP said Labour had been crushed between ""two nationalisms"" in Scotland and England.Mr Murphy said he left no legacy of bitterness for anyone in the Labour Party, and the only person he was angry at was the person who blamed Scottish Labour for the party's UK-wide general election defeat - a reference to Unite leader Len McCluskey.And he said that in many ways Scottish Labour was the ""least modernised part of the Labour movement"" and that he wanted his successor to be elected under a one member, one vote system.Mr Murphy added: ""The Labour Party's problem is not the link with trade unions, or even the relationship with Unite members - far from it. It is the destructive behaviour of one high profile trade unionist.""The leader of the Scottish Labour Party doesn't serve at the grace of Len McCluskey, and the next leader of the UK Labour Party should not be picked by Len McCluskey.""Mr McCluskey has been a vocal critic of Mr Murphy's leadership and opposed his appointment in December when Mr Murphy won the contest to replace Johann Lamont.Jim Murphy laughed and joked with Scottish Labour's sole MP as he made his way down the hotel corridor to announce his resignation.He certainly brought energy and dynamism to his election campaign - but all that achieved was Ian Murray in Edinburgh South.So as Mr Murphy bows out, who could replace him?The deputy leader Kezia Dugdale may want to step up or Neil Findlay could try again after challenging last time. Maybe the party's finance spokeswoman Jackie Baillie thinks her steady hand could steer the ship.Jenny Marra is also often talked about as future face of the party.Whoever steps into Jim Murphy's red shoes he or she will have to face a difficult 2016 Holyrood election, to put it mildly.There are also more fundamental questions about how the party can possibly move on as it faces a surging SNP.Mr Murphy was very much a creature of ""New Labour"" - but to today's generation that's old Labour.Party members may start looking for someone with no links to the past, neither a Brownite nor a Blairite. A 'cleanskin' - as the politicos put it - may well help re-connect with voters.That's a long way from now though - even some of the party's opponents may view this latest train wreck with a modicum of sympathy. Ms Lamont had resigned after claiming Scottish Labour was treated like a ""branch office"" by the London-based party leadership.Mr Murphy concluded his speech by saying: ""Scotland needs a strong Labour party; Scotland needs a united Labour party. We have been the greatest force for change in our nation's remarkable history. ""The Scottish Labour party will rise again. It will be under someone else's leadership and I am confident about my party's future.""Harriet Harman MP, acting leader of the UK Labour Party, said it would be for Scottish Labour to choose a new leader. She added: ""As a cabinet minister and leader of his party in Scotland, Jim has been a hugely important figure in the Labour Party. He leaves with the best wishes and thanks of our movement.""Labour peer Lord McConnell, a former Scottish first minister, said the party's problems were ""much deeper than one individual and one affiliate"".He said: ""We have a disconnect locally and nationally with wider Scottish society. ""We have a problem with our political positioning in the post devolution age where the party particularly at the UK level has never been comfortable with success in the Scottish parliament and has always tried to see things through a UK prism rather than a Scottish prism.""We need to find a new generation, a new leader, new generation, new ideas, a fresh approach.""In a tweet, Scottish first minister and SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said: ""I wish Jim Murphy all the very best for the future. Leadership is not easy and he deserves credit for standing up for what he believes in.""Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson also reacted on Twitter, saying: ""Jim Murphy announces a managed exit in order to help the party, which is to his credit. But leaves a tough gig for whoever comes next.""The meeting of Scottish Labour's executive was disrupted by protesters who entered the party's headquarters.Police were called and the protesters, who included persistent anti-austerity activists Sean Clerkin and Piers Doughty-Brown, left the building to protest further from the street outside.The protesters were calling for Mr Murphy to remain as leader to ""finish the job of destroying Scottish Labour"".A Police Scotland spokeswoman said officers had been called and found two protestors on the third floor of the building. She added: ""Both left on police arrival. Advice and assistance was given."""
2015-05-06,Labour contenders clash on spending,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32761561,"Prospective Labour leaders have clashed over Labour's record in government in their first public debate in the race to succeed Ed Miliband.Former cabinet ministers including Yvette Cooper and Andy Burnham defended Labour's fiscal record and spending on schools and hospitals.However, candidates from the 2010 intake of MPs argued that the party spent too much while in office.The debate followed Chuka Umunna's withdrawal from the leadership contest.The remaining candidates appeared at the annual conference of the Progress think tank in London.There was agreement that Labour needed to demonstrate economic credibility to regain power, with shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt telling the meeting that the party needed to be ""trusted with public finances and the family finances"".Mr Hunt, who was first elected to Parliament in 2010 when Labour lost power, argued the last Labour government ""spent too much"" and failed to ""leave enough economic headroom to deal with the economic crisis and the recession"".Shadow health minister Liz Kendall said: ""There's absolutely nothing progressive about spending more on debt interest payments than on educating our children.""But shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: ""The Tories have had a triumph of spin over the facts in saying what they said about the economic record of the last Labour government.""The former chief secretary to the Treasury said the deficit did ""grow too large"" in the government's later years but insisted: ""The last Labour government ran more surpluses in its first term than the Tories did in 18 years.""Yvette Cooper, another former chief secretary to the Treasury, said: ""We should never let anybody tell us that it was too many teachers, doctors or nurses that caused Lehman Brothers bank in New York to crash.""Shadow international development secretary Mary Creagh said: ""People have forgotten the economic credibility that the last Labour government had.""She said Labour had built schools and hospitals that were ""treasured in our communities"".Ms Cooper, Mr Burnham, Ms Kendall and Ms Creagh have declared their intention to run for leader, while Mr Hunt told the conference he would make an announcement next week.At the same event, shadow energy secretary Caroline Flint announced she would be running for deputy leader.The Don Valley MP told the Today programme ahead of the debate that Labour lost the election because ""fundamentally the public did not trust us on the economy"".Exeter MP Ben Bradshaw has already announced a bid to be deputy, saying Labour ""must and could win the next election"", but only if it ""broadens its appeal by adopting sensible, centre-left politics which celebrate wealth creation and entrepreneurship"".Former Labour campaign co-ordinator Tom Watson is reported to be crowd-funding a deputy leadership bid, while Walthamstow MP Stella Creasy has said she is ""open to the question"" of running.Barnsley East MP and shadow transport secretary Michael Dugher - a fierce critic of Ed Miliband's election campaign - is to run Mr Burnham's campaign, according to the website LabourList.It is reported that Mr Burnham also has the backing of Labour peer Lord Falconer, who was lord chancellor and justice secretary under Tony Blair and was close to the former PM.Shadow culture secretary Chris Bryant has signalled his backing for Ms Cooper, tweeting that the next leader must be ""someone who's been tried in the fiery furnace of public opinion"".Mr Hunt said on Friday he would be be attending the debate - along with the other four hopefuls - to ""set out my analysis on how we begin to understand what went so wrong and why"".He added: ""We must use this leadership election to ask some very profound questions.""All voices in the party must be heard so that we can have a full and proper assessment as to why the politics of nationalism triumphed in Scotland and huge swathes of England, and how we have allowed the Conservative Party to present a more compelling vision for Britain to so many millions of people.""Speculation still surrounds shadow business secretary Mr Umunna's decision to pull out on Friday, when he said he was not ""comfortable"" with the ""pressure"" of being a candidate.As well as citing extensive pressure and scrutiny Mr Umunna also said he was ruling himself out because of concerns about the impact of the bid on his family.A rising star of the party, Mr Umunna was first elected to Parliament in 2010 - alongside Tristram Hunt and Liz Kendall - before joining the shadow cabinet.Asked about the candidate who might win, Conservative Chancellor George Osborne said: ""The Labour leadership contest has descended into farce.""But it's not actually about personalities. I don't think the Labour Party any more represents the working people of this country who aspire to a better life."""

I'm not suggesting he takes a break from being leader.""Clearly the national executive has the authority, they're the ruling body. ""I'm told that they made a decision. I'm told it was a procedurally correct decision, he is the leader but I think it's important that as leader he takes a break and I think it's important that we work out how these complex questions are answered by a team.""No one person has all the answers. I'm particularly concerned about tone, making sure we get a tone that ensures that the 27 million people who didn't vote for UKIP last week may be persuaded to vote for us in future.""The party has been beset by wrangling since Mr Farage agreed to stay on as leader, days after standing down after failing to get elected in Thanet South.He had pledged before the general election that he would quit the post if he failed to get elected to Parliament.Senior aide Matthew Richardson has left the party, following claims from MEP Patrick O'Flynn that Mr Farage had fallen under the influence of ""inexperienced"" advisers.UKIP has also confirmed the departure of Mr Farage's chief of staff Raheem Kassam.Mr Farage ruled out quitting as leader on BBC's Question Time on Thursday, saying he had ""phenomenal"" support, and has challenged his critics to decide whether they want to stay in the party.In his article, Mr Carswell had said that ""knowing how difficult it is to lead a party makes me admire Nigel Farage all the more"".""I know that I never could,"" he added, stressing that he would find it ""impossible to simultaneously lead UKIP, be the voice of the party in the Commons, represent my Clacton constituents and at the same time be a husband and a dad"".However, he said that ""even leaders need to take a break"", adding: ""Nigel needs to take a break now.""UKIP got nearly four million votes at the election, but returned only one MP - former Conservative Mr Carswell in the Clacton constituency."

Under the plans, ministers could force schools rated as ""requiring improvement"" and missing new government benchmarks to become an academy.Coasting schools have average results which have often flatlined over time.Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, Mrs Morgan said faster action was needed.She said: ""Our big priorities will be to speed up the process for tackling failing schools; extend our academies programme to tackle 'coasting' schools; and deliver on our commitment to open new free schools.""The proposals will be in a new bill due to be introduced in the Queen's Speech. ""First, we will take new powers to step in from the moment that a school is found to be failing,"" Mrs Morgan said.""From day one, regional schools commissioners will be able to bring in new leadership and support from other excellent schools and heads, and we will speed up the process of turning schools into academies to make sure that new expert leadership is found for all schools that need it as quickly as possible.""She said that coasting schools will be put on an immediate notice to improve and could then be taken over and turned into an academy.They will be required to work with a team of ""expert"" head teachers.She said: ""Those that aren't able to demonstrate a clear plan for improvement will be given new leadership - we know this works in turning schools around.""More than 3,300 schools in England are labelled ""requires improvement"", but the plans are unlikely to cover that many schools.Under the current system, secondary schools are considered to be failing, and therefore eligible for intervention, if fewer than 40% of their students score at least five Cs at GCSE, including English and maths, and they do not meet national averages in pupil progress.In primary schools, the threshold for intervention is if fewer than 65% of pupils get Level 4 in reading, writing and maths and a below average number of pupils make the expected amount of progress.It is not yet clear how coasting schools will be deemed in need of intervention.It is understood that a new category will be devised covering schools which are rated as ""requires improvement"" and which fail to meet a new set of standards on improvement."
2015-05-06,Co-op Group to keep political funding,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-32762858,"The Co-operative Group has decided to continue financially supporting the Co-operative Party, which has strong ties to Labour.Members of the group, the UK's biggest mutual organisation, voted on the issue at their annual general meeting.They passed a motion by 48,579 for, to 39,479 against, to approve ""political expenditures"" of up to £1m which support the movement's objectives.Last year the Co-op Group gave £625,000 to the Co-op Party.This figure was down on the sums donated in previous years. The AGM also included a vote on new corporate governance procedures which would mean members having less of a direct say.The Co-operative Group is still recovering from a period of financial mismanagement and some members have recently expressed concerns about how elections to the board are chosen.The banking arm of the group came close to collapse in 2013, bringing the whole group to a £2.5bn annual loss that year. The Co-op Party includes among its members a number of Labour MPs, including shadow chancellor Chris Leslie and Walthamstow MP Stella Creasy. The politicians stand as candidates of both the Co-operative Party and the Labour Party, and the two political movements have strong historical ties. The board asked the members of the Co-operative Group whether they wanted to continue financially supporting the Co-operative Party, or any other party. Allan Leighton, chairman of the Co-op Group, said: ""There's a clear remit from the members to continue to support the Labour Party.""It allows us to now have a conversation with the Co-op Labour Party about what we do next.""There was also a members' motion on the agenda, put forward by those in favour of making political donations of up to £1m a year.The motion to approve political funding ""not to exceed £1m per annum"" was carried by 55.17% to 44.83%.BBC business correspondent Joe Lynam said: ""To meet a £1.5bn hole in its accounts - mostly stemming from its banking division - the Co-op Group has had to sell off parts of its businesses and hand over majority control of its bank to American hedge funds.""It's also in the process of radically changing the way it runs itself into a more corporate structure with less of a direct say by its members.""He said that ""in theory"", each of the 2.8 million Co-op members could vote on a series of motions about the reforms, as well as how its bosses are paid, and retaining the links to the Co-operative party.One of the group's largest independent societies, Midcounties, recently threatened legal action over a shortlist of six candidates for the group's board being reduced to three - the number of positions available - before a member vote.

""We'll crack down hard on tax avoidance and aggressive tax planning by the rich - because everyone should pay their fair share.  ""We will always protect the most vulnerable, but we also need a welfare system that's fair to the people who pay for it. If you can work you should be working, so we'll take the next steps in our benefit reforms to make sure that happens.""Second, we've got to go on helping businesses create jobs in Britain, so we move towards full employment. That means facing a hard truth: in Britain we produce about a quarter less for every hour we work than countries like America or Germany. Fixing that long-running productivity weakness is the big challenge for the next five years.""So in the Budget we'll spend less on welfare, and instead invest to create three million more apprenticeships, so that young people can learn a trade, get better jobs and earn more.""After the Budget in March independent forecaster the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said that Mr Osborne needed to spell out exactly how he plans to cut £12bn from welfare spending.Of those £12bn planned cuts, £2bn were outlined ahead of the general election - all the cuts are supposed to be in place by 2017-18.Labour's shadow energy and climate change secretary, Caroline Flint, accused the Tories of making ""a number of uncosted promises"" during the election campaign.She told the BBC: ""It will be interesting to see who is going to pay for those uncosted policies when they bring the Budget in July."""

They absolutely loved how he helped them and he was a highly-regarded local MP,"" Mr Bone said.""He stood up for what was right rather than what the party line was. In those days - the John Major years - it was much more difficult to stand up against the party machine. He had strong views on Europe.""Sir Peter started his career as an insurance broker, joining the Wycombe Young Conservatives in 1949 and the Oxford University Conservative Association in 1951.He went on to become a Conservative councillor on Buckinghamshire County Council between 1961 and 1967.Wellingborough mayor-elect Barry Graves also paid tribute to Sir Peter, remembering him as a ""very strong constituency MP"".""I remember going out and canvassing with him and he would go everywhere. He knew the area and the people. He was very much a man of the local constituency.""He was ""a very approachable man"", Mr Graves added.Sir Peter was knighted in 1994. "

The Smith proposals included giving Holyrood the power to set income tax rates and bands, as well as control over a share of VAT and some welfare benefits. But Ms Sturgeon's SNP also wants the Scottish Parliament to be given powers over business taxes, employment law, the minimum wage and additional powers over welfare.Speaking after meeting Ms Sturgeon, Mr Cameron told the BBC: ""Let's make sure Smith is implemented in full. I'm going to keep the commitment I made to the people of Scotland. Let's get that done first because it does create a really strong Scottish Parliament.""He added: ""Of course, if people want to make future proposals I'll look at them.""The prime minister again said he did not support full fiscal autonomy for Scotland - the responsibility for all areas of tax and spending except defence and foreign affairs - stating that it would mean £7bn of cuts or extra tax-raising.What Nicola Sturgeon is trying to say is she has a mandate. She has 56 out of the 59 MPs elected in Scotland and she won 50% of the vote - unprecedented here in Scotland.She says that gives her leverage to push David Cameron. David Cameron says he wants to keep the nation together.The language coming out of Westminster last week was very much a cordial one. 'We will listen'.Nicola Sturgeon has warned him that if he doesn't listen, then the people of Scotland will judge him accordingly.Ms  Sturgeon described the hour-long talks at her official residence at Bute House as ""constructive and business-like"". She said Mr Cameron had made a ""commitment"" that the Smith proposals would be implemented ""as agreed"".""But secondly the prime minister agreed that he would look at proposals that we would now send to suggest the areas we can go beyond Smith,"" Ms Sturgeon said.""There was no agreement in terms of the substance of that but we will submit those proposals, the prime minister has said they will consider them and there will be a meeting to look at how we take that further forward.""Referring to her party's success in last week's general election, which saw the SNP win 56 out of 59 Scottish seats, Ms Sturgeon said: ""People in Scotland have now voted fairly convincingly for the SNP and sent a message that we want the Smith Commission proposals to go further and be built on.""The ball is in his court but I'm going into this in good faith.""She added: ""David Cameron and I are a world apart politically but, where we can, I'm determined to do business in the interests of the people of Scotland and across the UK.""She said she would have a ""constructive and business-like"" relationship with the prime minister. The two leaders shook hands on the front steps of Bute House as Mr Cameron arrived. Mr Cameron left the building shortly before 11:00, almost an hour after he had arrived.The two sides agreed to hold more regular discussions in the future, possibly quarterly. "
2015-05-06,Umunna withdraws Labour leader bid,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32748106,"Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna has withdrawn from the Labour party leadership contest, just days after throwing his hat into the ring.The MP, 36, said in a statement that he was not comfortable with the level of pressure and scrutiny that came with being a leadership candidate.Mr Umunna also cited concerns about the impact of the bid on his family.BBC political editor Nick Robinson said the MP's team insisted no ""unwelcome press story"" lay behind the move.But Mr Umunna had been shocked by the level of scrutiny of himself, his mother, sister and girlfriend, he said.You can follow the latest reaction here.A rising star of the party, Mr Umunna was first elected to Parliament in 2010 before joining the shadow cabinet.He confirmed his candidacy for the Labour leadership via a post on his Facebook page on 12 May, saying the party under Ed Miliband had failed to appeal to enough voters in England.But on Friday he said he had not found the leadership bid to be ""a comfortable experience"".I understand that Chuka Umunna has told friends that ""this is not right for me or people close to me. I'm human, the rest of my life is more important to me than politics.""The shadow business secretary has been distressed by the degree of scrutiny he, his family and his girlfriend have come under since he declared his intention to stand for the labour leadership.I am told that this includes reporters waiting outside the houses of relatives late at night.Friends of Mr Umunna deny that he is nervous of not getting the support of enough MPs to run for the leadership; they point out that he already has half the necessary names and that there are some weeks to go.The shadow business secretary now wants to play a leading role in arguing that Britain should stay in the EU and does not rule out seeking the leadership in the future.He said he thought he had understood ""the scrutiny and attention a leadership contest would bring"", but added: ""However, since the night of our defeat last week I have been subject to the added level of pressure that comes with being a leadership candidate.""The shadow business secretary said he had wondered if it was too soon for him to stand for the leadership, and ""I fear it was."" He also cited concerns about the impact on ""the rest of one's life"" and those close to him.""Consequently, after further reflection, I am withdrawing my candidacy,"" he said.Mr Umunna said he would continue to serve as shadow business secretary and hoped to ""play a leading role"" in Labour's campaign to keep the UK in the EU during the forthcoming in/out referendum.Commenting on the news, Labour former culture secretary Ben Bradshaw - who is expected to run for deputy leader - said Mr Umunna was a ""terrible loss"" to the field.He told the BBC's Daily Politics the Streatham MP had been the candidate the Conservative Party ""feared the most"".""And if it's the result of pressure on an extended family or an extended group of friends, I think that's a very sad reflection on our political culture,"" he said.Chuka Umunna feels ""liberated"", he told me, by his decision to quit the Labour leadership race.He hopes to be given a good role (shadow chancellor, I wonder?) by whoever becomes Labour leader. And I expect he'll become very high profile in the campaign to keep Britain in Europe, which is increasingly looking like it will be next May.He'll endorse a candidate in the next four weeks before nominations close. It will be very interesting to see who he piles in behind.Read more from Allegra (see post 13.23).Former Labour leader Lord Kinnock said he thought Mr Umunna had made the right decision.He said: ""If he felt in his soul that he wasn't prepared to subject himself - and more importantly his family - to the kind of attention which is fairly typical, sadly, these days, he has done absolutely the right thing.""There is no point at all in inflicting avoidable, unnecessary misery on those you love most.""Leadership contender Mary Creagh said she had ""huge respect"" for Mr Umunna, telling BBC Radio 4's World at One programme it took ""courage"" to withdraw from the leadership race.Mr Umunna was ""a big beast"" and would play a ""big role"" in the future of the Labour Party, she added.Yvette Cooper, Andy Burnham, Liz Kendall and Mary Creagh have already thrown their hats into the ring for Labour's top job while a number of other potential candidates, including Dan Jarvis, Alan Johnson and David Lammy, have ruled themselves out. Candidates must secure nominations from 34 colleagues - 15% of the party's MPs - by 15 June to make it on to ballot papers, which will be sent to members in August ahead of the leader's election a month later."

However, Mr Justice Stuart Smith at Southwark Crown Court said there was a ""very strong likelihood"" a custodial sentence would follow.The jury heard how Mote submitted numerous false expenses claims for payment for work that organisations had allegedly carried out on his behalf.Mote claimed the money was to pay whistleblowers in cash through third parties. He also said he had been ""targeted for being an anti-EU MEP.""During his time an MEP he also made £250,000 legitimate expenses claims.No date has been set for the sentencing."

2015-05-06,Round-up: BBC experts' analysis,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/election-2015-32650417,"The political future of the United Kingdom has become clearer after the results of the general election emerged around the country.David Cameron says he hopes to govern for all of the UK after the Conservatives took 331 seats - enough to form a slender majority in the Commons.Labour has been all but wiped out by the SNP in Scotland and suffered a disappointing set of results elsewhere, while the Lib Dems are left with just eight MPs after many party heavyweights such as Vince Cable and Danny Alexander lost their seats.So with battles won and lost and the fall-out and celebrations beginning, BBC correspondents examine the implications and challenges that lie ahead for the new government - and for those whose political careers have been ended by voters.No pollster, no pundit, no political leader saw it coming - not even David Cameron himself.Governing parties don't gain seats. Parties that have implemented painful cuts and are promising more certainly don't. Until that is the Conservative Party did - achieving what had seemed to be Mission Impossible - a Tory majority.Until that is David Cameron's personal triumph which triggered the near simultaneous resignation of his three principle opponents - Messrs Miliband, Clegg and Farage.They did so in part because they helped to crush their partners in coalition these last five years - reducing the Liberal Democrat parliamentary party to a size when it can fit into two London taxis and still have two seats to spare.In part because the extraordinary tidal wave of support for the SNP swept dozens of once safe Labour seats away.In part because Nigel Farage persuaded millions to vote for him but secured just one seat - not, though, the one he was standing in.Read more from Nick Robinson hereThe question uppermost in the prime minister's mind as he assembles his new government is how to keep the kingdom united.""Above all I want to bring our country together,"" he revealed after the result, ""to reclaim a mantle we should never have lost - the mantle of one nation, one United Kingdom"".Looking at the political landscape from Land's End today is very different to the view from John O'Groats.A sea of Conservative and Unionist blue dominates the scene across much of England, while a field of SNP nationalist yellow stretches to the horizon and beyond from the north.David Cameron's greatest challenge is to prevent the union he supports being torn apart by mutual resentment - resentment from Scotland at a Westminster government dominated by English Tories, and resentment from England at the preferential treatment people think is being given to the Scots.Those who assumed the future of the Union had been safeguarded by the Scottish referendum must think again.Read more from Mark Easton hereOne thing is rock-solid true: the Conservatives who worked on this campaign are as surprised by the result as the pollsters, pundits, politicians and general population.Maybe they shouldn't be - the economy is in good shape and the Conservatives had incumbency advantage.But when I travelled back from the prime minister's last rally with a group of exhausted Conservative campaign officials it was clear that 290 seats was a hoped-for target.No-one talked about anything over 300 seats, and no-one even mentioned an overall majority.So what special sauce pushed David Cameron into No 10 with a Commons majority?Mr Cameron had two simple messages in the campaign and he rarely veered away from them; the first - the economy is in good shape and the recovery is threatened by Labour. And the second - the SNP would hold a Labour-led government to ransom.Read more from Jonny Dymond hereBrian Taylor, BBC political editor, ScotlandOf all the comments on the overnight apocalypse, undoubtedly the most straightforward came from a defeated Scottish Labour MP.Since there were quite a few of them, let me narrow the focus a little. Come on down, Tom Harris.Mr Harris had plainly anticipated defeat. Nonetheless, he looked suitably lugubrious as his fate was confirmed.Why, he was asked eagerly, had Labour lost? ""Because we did not win enough votes.""Psephologically, it is perfect. Complete in itself. Psychologically, it sums up Labour's gloom without descending into subsidiary matters such as leadership, strategy and the rest. As a forward-thinking strategy, it is ideal. Win more votes. Simple.Read more from Brian Taylor hereThis has been an election which may have more profound consequences than almost any in living memory.We now face a generational decision about our future in Europe, with an EU referendum in two years' time almost certain.There will also be serious questions about the future of the Union, following an SNP landslide that has turned Scotland into a virtual one-party state.David Cameron's victory also represents a colossal achievement.Only once before in recent history has an incumbent government increased its majority - and that was Mrs Thatcher in her prime in the 1980s.It is also a significant personal victory for Mr Cameron and a rebuff for those in his party who had become increasingly sceptical about his ability to win.But while it may represent a defeat for those Tories who saw this election as a potential opportunity to rid themselves of David Cameron, he must now govern with a wafer-thin majority.For the SNP, their stunning victory can only increase the pressure on Nicola Sturgeon to include a commitment to a second independence referendum in her party's manifesto for next year's Scottish elections.It is an election which has not just defied all the predictions of the pollsters and pundits - but which may yet prompt the most fundamental re-casting of British politics for a generation.Read more from Norman Smith hereAfter an extraordinary night, some brief conclusions:Read more from James Landale hereIs this the end of the union?That is the question many people will be asking this morning after the party which has fought for Scottish independence for 80 years swept to victory.The answer from the jubilant Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon is a firm ""No"".She insists that her MPs will speak for all of Scotland, not just for the 45% who voted for the country to leave the United Kingdom last September.In the closing hours of the most extraordinary election campaign which anyone in Scotland can remember, Ms Sturgeon turned to talk of ""legitimacy.""That will be her watchword in the coming days as she argues that the prime minister cannot ignore the democratic will of the Scottish people.Politically, Scotland and England this morning look and feel like very different countries.Read more from James Cook hereAfter weeks of chatter about an election too close to call, it wasn't that close at all.David Cameron will be continuing as our prime minister.So, what is all this likely to mean?A referendum on whether the UK stays in, or leaves, the European Union, within the next two-and-a-half years.A race to be the next leader of the Labour Party.A race to be the next leader of the Liberal Democrats.And a huge new presence of Scottish National Party MPs at Westminster.And so here's another thing we know for certain this morning: Politics ain't going to be boring any time soon.Read more from Chris Mason hereFor Labour the story of their terrible night is rapidly turning into the search for a new leader. So who will that be?Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, is almost certain to run.  Even before this election, both he and another almost inevitable candidate, Chuka Umunna, had raised eyebrows inside the party at the work they had put in, preparing the ground with members and the unions for potential bids.Yvette Cooper, before the election, was still thought not to have made up her mind over whether to run. That decision has been made perhaps a little easier as her husband, Ed Balls, has lost his seat.She is certainly potentially in the frame, along with two lesser known names - Liz Kendall and Dan Jarvis - two MPs who were only elected in 2010 for the first time. This could be their moment. But whoever is in the job, they face a monumental task.Read Laura Kuenssberg's Twitter hereSterling is up (the most for seven years against the euro), share prices are up (especially bank shares like Lloyds and RBS, and energy shares such as Centrica), government bond prices are up.To state the obvious, investors love the Tories' general election victory.There are a few reasons.One (no surprise here) is that Labour's threat of breaking up banks and imposing energy price caps has been lifted.Second is that investors have been discounting days and weeks of wrangling after polling day over who would form the government - and so they are semi-euphoric that we already know who's in charge.Third, many investors tend to be economically conservative and instinctively Conservative.But although the City may be a bit drunk on the result, its pleasure in Ed Miliband's and Ed Balls' humiliation may be making it a bit blind - perhaps dangerously so - to some bumps in the economic road ahead.Read more from Robert Peston hereNigel Farage dreamed of holding the balance of power, but in the end his UKIP party is now worse off than when it came into the election.At the seventh time of asking he was rejected - this time by the people of Thanet South. It was a similar story in Rochester and Strood where Mark Reckless, who sensationally defected from the Tories last year, was also sent packing.In seats on UKIP's target list, like Thurrock in Essex, the party failed to make gains. In Grimsby - where Mr Farage went twice in the last six weeks - they came third.UKIP got around four million votes - with especially strong showings in north-east and south-east England - but it's ended up with just one MP, and a vacancy at the top. This has led to UKIP attacking the current system of choosing MPs, which it's described as ""busted"" and ""dysfunctional"".In one sense, this campaign was a complete failure and it's left an aftermath of angry voters, and others wondering if the UKIP bubble has burst.Read Robin Brant's Twitter hereI monitored 91 GB-wide voting intention polls during the 2015 election campaign and found nothing in them to prepare me for the final outcome.The good news for the pollsters was that their share for the Lib Dems was pretty close, as were the shares for UKIP, the Greens and the catch-all category of Others.The bad news for the polling industry was that the crucial shares for Conservative and Labour were the ones where they came most adrift.When all the qualifications of margins of error are allowed, there did appear to be a systematic overstatement of the Labour share and an equally systematic understatement of the Conservative one.It is for the pollsters to decide whether to conduct a review of their performance but I trust they will avoid the initial knee-jerk reaction of the immediate aftermath of the 1992 polls debacle.This general election performance follows the performance of the polls in the 2014 Scottish referendum where the choice was simply binary and yet all the polls were out by between 4-6%.Something is wrong. A lot of us would like to know what it is.Read more from David Cowling hereThe words ""political earthquake"" have been translated into numerous European languages, making front page news across the continent.While Britons now examine the domestic minutiae of the election result, here in mainland Europe the vote means one thing: a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU. And that has the potential to create an earthquake of its own.The guardian of the EU treaties Mr Cameron wants to change - Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker - has said again he'd listen to what Britain's new government proposed.Read more from Katya Adler here"

2015-05-06,A history of political plots,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32749971,"Nigel Farage has apparently seen off a challenge to his leadership of UKIP - a move described by his former election strategist as a ""coup"". He's not the only party leader to face an attempted ousting. But can you recover from such a revolt?In 2006, the Labour prime minister was the target of what became known as the ""curry house conspiracy"" - a coup to remove him and install his chancellor, Gordon Brown, as prime minister.It would lead to several of the plotters' resignations - but not Mr Blair's. However, it was successful to a degree in that it forced the party leader into naming a departure date.The move against him was reportedly masterminded by Tom Watson, a defence minister at the time, who was also rumoured to have had a secret meeting with Mr Brown on the eve of the revolt.Apparently, Mr Watson and three fellow West Midlands MPs - Sion Simon, David Wright (both ministerial aides) and Khalid Mahmood - met over a biryani at a Wolverhampton curry house to discuss the PM's future, before dispatching a missive calling for him to quit.The letter - which attracted the support of a number of normally loyal Labour MPs - was leaked to the press, and ultimately resulted in Mr Watson's resignation.In his parting letter, the West Bromwich East MP took a shot at the prime minister, who he said should step down in the interests of party and country.Mr Blair denounced his actions and branded the former minister ""disloyal, discourteous and wrong"", saying he would have sacked him if he had not resigned.But Mr Watson's departure was swiftly followed by the resignations of six other junior members of government - who had also signed the rebel letter - in protest at the prime minister's refusal to say when he would step down as Labour leader.The whole affair resulted in Mr Blair announcing his intention to step aside within 12 months - which he duly did, on 27 June 2007.But it did nothing to quash internal dissent and speculation in the party over the future leadership of the party.Labour prime minister Gordon Brown found his leadership under threat in 2009 after one of his cabinet ministers dramatically quit the government and called for him to resign.Work and Pensions Secretary James Purnell - a former aide to Tony Blair - resigned from his post after the polls closed in the local and European elections, in which Labour was forecast to do badly.Explaining his decision to quit, Mr Purnell said the prime minister made a Conservative victory ""more, not less, likely"".It was Mr Brown's first direct challenge from a cabinet minister - but it would not topple the Labour leader as senior members of government refused to follow Mr Purnell's lead.Mr Brown was safe for the time being. But several months later, in January 2010, a fresh leadership challenge was mounted by two senior former Labour cabinet ministers.Geoff Hoon and Patricia Hewitt wrote to all Labour MPs, saying the party was ""deeply divided"" over Mr Brown's leadership and that the best way to resolve the issue was by way of secret ballot.They insisted it was not an ""attempted coup"" but a necessary step to resolve divisions within the party.But the duo could only muster the public support of a handful of backbenchers long-opposed to Mr Brown, with the majority of the party's MPs less than impressed by the move, which came just weeks before the general election.As the day wore on, a succession of cabinet ministers came out to back the PM, suggesting there was little momentum behind the plot - although it was noted that several were not exactly gushing in their support of Mr Brown.As history tells us, neither leadership challenge bore fruit but they reflected the internal doubts and divisions over Mr Brown at the helm.As leadership toppling attempts go, this one in 2014 was regarded as a particularly ""botched"" and ""shambolic coup"". Indeed, former Lib Dem leader Lord (Paddy) Ashdown described the move as a ""plot of deep malice"".Its instigator, Lord (Matthew) Oakeshott - a close ally of the-then Business Secretary Vince Cable - tried to unseat Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg.The peer was found to have commissioned secret polls suggesting the party would do better at the 2015 general election without Mr Clegg in the driving seat.The man Lord Oakeshott had long had in mind to take Mr Clegg's place - Mr Cable, who was on government business in China at the time - was forced to publicly condemn his friend's actions and state his backing for Mr Clegg.But Lord Oakeshott said the business secretary had in fact known about his polls and their findings.Nevertheless, the peer - who was denounced by the Lib Dem leadership for spending money that could have been spent on campaigning - quit the party, and issued a warning shot on his way out about the Lib Dems' future prospects.Mr Cable largely emerged unscathed but he faced questions about his loyalty to the leader. Although the two sought to put paid to reports of a rift with a (painfully awkward, 'nothing to see here, folks') stage-managed pint in a pub.Although the revolt failed, and Mr Clegg remained at the helm, the Lib Dems did go on to suffer a trouncing at the general election, losing nearly 50 of its MPs - one of them, Mr Cable himself - prompting his leader to quit.The Conservatives have a reputation for being more ruthless than their party rivals when it comes to getting rid of leaders they sense are no longer effectual.But, in 1995, Prime Minister John Major - tired of persistent rumours of a leadership challenge - decided to take the bull by the horns and trigger a surprise leadership election to silence his detractors.His own backbenchers had questioned Mr Major's ability to unite and lead the party, which was deeply divided over Europe.So ""put up or shut up"", he told them as he tendered his resignation as Conservative Party leader but not prime minister.But then stepped forward eurosceptic MP John Redwood, who resigned from the cabinet in order to contest Mr Major's leadership.This was unexpected by many, as the PM had said there had been assurances from his cabinet that none would stand against him.But Mr Major went on to win the ensuing election with a comfortable defeat over his challenger, who was not included in the PM's consequent cabinet reshuffle.No further contested leadership election took place until after the Conservatives' defeat at the 1997 general election, paving the way for William Hague to take over the running of the party.Not all attempts to oust a party leader end in failure: as Margaret Thatcher found out to her peril.With three electoral victories under her belt, the Conservative prime minister's downfall would come at the hands of her own party - not the voters.It was on 1 November 1990 when Geoffrey (now Lord) Howe - one of Mrs Thatcher's longest-serving ministers - resigned over differences with the party leader over Europe.In his now infamous speech on the floor of the House of Commons, he attacked the PM's policies and leadership style, comparing being one of her cabinet ministers to opening the batting at cricket only to find his bat had been ""broken... by the team captain"".It sparked the beginning of the end of the 11-year Thatcher reign.Michael (now Lord) Heseltine seized on the opportunity to challenge the prime minister in the ensuing leadership contest, from which she would eventually withdraw and John Major emerge as her successor. Reflecting on the revolt and its implications on the Conservative Party, Baroness Thatcher's biographer Charles Moore wrote: ""Because the coup was unjustified, and so trust broke down, the politics of the next 15 years were those of civil war."""
2015-05-06,Election swings and roundabouts,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-32741924,"If election manifesto claims are all about smoke and mirrors, should we now add swings and roundabouts to the political metaphor?There's an intriguing aspect to the general election results in the Midlands that puzzled me.It's the striking contrast in the swings between Labour and the Conservatives.David Cameron and his campaign strategists knew they were home and dry when Nuneaton was the first Midlands marginal to declare.It was not only a Tory hold but a swing to the Conservatives from Labour of 3%.I was in the Nottingham suburb of Beeston awaiting the result of the Broxtowe count. Would its high profile Conservative MP Anna Soubry survive a red surge?Nuneaton set the pattern. Across the Midlands, both east and west, there was a uniform swing of between three and four per cent to the Tories - Warwickshire North 3%, Amber Valley 4%, Derbyshire South 4% and Sherwood 4%. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan topped the Tory swingometer in the Midlands marginals with 5% in Loughborough.Yet in the big cities, it was a very different story. The swing went to Labour.So in Nottingham East they enjoyed a 6% swing, Nottingham South 5.8%, Leicester South 7.3%, Leicester West 5%, Birmingham Hall Green 12%, Birmingham Hodge Hill 8%.If swings to Labour on this scale had gone beyond the city ring road roundabouts and into the suburbs, Ed Miliband would have become prime minister by now.In confidence, one senior Labour insider in Nottingham told me its success in the city wards was down to organisation, experience and its teams of activists.""We won the ground war. If Nottingham's city boundaries were extended into Sherwood and Broxtowe, we would have won those constituencies as well,"" he told me.Labour leadership candidate, Leicester West's Liz Kendall has identified her party's problem beyond the ring road roundabout.It's about reaching out to Middle England.""We need to show people that we understand their aspirations and ambitions for the future,"" she told the Sunday Times.The problem for Labour was that Middle England was not interested in what the party offered…and still isn't. The Cameron brand worked its magic in those Midlands marginals... it'll take something or someone special to break up that ballot box relationship."
2015-05-06,Royal 'lobbying',https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32740154,"Prince Charles sent 27 letters to then Prime Minister Tony Blair and members of his government between September 2004 and March 2005, ""despite the Freedom of Information Act!"" as the prince joked in one.But did his suggestions and concerns have any bearing on the behaviour of Mr Blair's government?The request: Prince Charles expresses his worries over an EU directive on complementary medicines ""which is… effectively outlawing the use of certain herbal extracts"".  Mr Blair replied, offering moral support and practical help. He agreed that ""the implementation as it is currently planned is crazy"" and set out an action plan that included delaying implementation for all existing products to 2011. What happened: Herbal products were not required to be authorised until 2011, just as Mr Blair had promised. Prince Charles continues to sell his own brand of complementary products, Duchy Herbals, through Boots and Waitrose. The request: Writing to Mr Blair, the prince expresses a ""growing sense of anxiety"" that the Hill Farming Allowance, which supports farmers working on Britain's uplands, could be scrapped. In his reply, the prime minister said he understood that the Hill Farm Allowance would continue until 2007. What happened: The allowance lasted until the end of Labour's tenure in 2010, when it was abolished.The request: Just 18 months after the US-led invasion of Iraq, Prince Charles raised the issue of poor performance of Lynx helicopters in high temperatures, saying: ""I fear that this is just one more example of where our Armed Forces are being asked to do an extremely challenging job (particularly in Iraq) without the necessary resources.""Mr Blair replied: ""On the subject of the Lynx helicopter, the limitations of the existing platform, particularly in the extremely challenging environment within Iraq, are well recognised by the Ministry of Defence."" He added that replacement of the helicopters would be a priority. What happened: Mr Blair's comments go much further than what he was saying about the subject at the time. In the event, though, the fleet was not fully upgraded until 2011.The request: Prince Charles lamented that the government's TB prevention plans might not ""include a commitment to deal with the badger problem in the immediate future"" and pushed strongly for a cull, saying: ""All I can say is that I do urge you to look again at introducing a proper cull of badgers where it is necessary.""Mr Blair sympathised, saying he could ""personally see the case for culling badgers"". However, he was unwilling to commit to a cull.  What happened: Culling trials were conducted from 1998-2005. The final results, published in 2008, said that the badger cull could ""make no meaningful contribution"" to curbing bovine TB. It wasn't until 2013 that a full culling programme began in two pilot areas. These ended with the conclusion that the pilots had been neither humane nor effective at curbing the spread of TB.The request: Then Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell wrote to Prince Charles to say she had decided to give parts of the historic Smithfield meat market Grade II listed status, and was trying to persuade deputy prime minister John Prescott to ""call in"" the planning application to prevent demolition of other parts of the site. She had been swayed by evidence provided by Sir Neil Cossons, who was English Heritage chair at the time, after he had been asked by the prince to add his support. Prince Charles replied that he was ""extremely glad to read of your appreciation of the value of this group of buildings"". According to the Guardian, market workers desperate to see the redevelopment of the site invited the prince to meet them to discuss it, but his office said he was ""unlikely to accept as he did not want to interfere in the planning process"".What happened: Smithfield market is still the subject of planning battles a decade on. Successive planning applications have been refused by ministers. Last year then Communities Secretary Eric Pickles rejected plans for an office development on the site, stating that ""the extent of damage that the application would cause to the important heritage assets at Smithfield runs entirely counter to national and policy objectives intended to protect such assets from harm"".In March, the Museum of London announced a move from its current Barbican site to the Smithfield market building."
2015-05-06,Election fallout,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32703139,"""Some of those gimmicks - that tombstone, whatever idiot thought that up I do not know!""I was talking to the former Mayor of Crawley in Sussex, John Mortimer, in the town's Labour Supporters Club about the vexed question of what went wrong, and where Labour should go next. This seat is one of those southern seats Labour hoped to take, but failed.I hear a whole range of views in the club.""They didn't give nothing to depend on, they should be clear, and a little bit more down to Earth."" ""Good party, wrong leader, they don't look after business enough.""Councillor John Stanley tells me: ""I think in a way we did go too left, but now we can go a bit centre-left, or centre, depending who the new leader is.""The former mayor sums up the mood on the doorstep: ""Whatever we told them, they didn't believe us.""  Expect to hear all those views, and more, in the coming leadership contest. Step back from the angst of supporters, and it may not be that hard to see why Labour failed.  An economic recovery, hailed by independent organisations as the result of government policy, undid a party that had loudly proclaimed for five years that the coalition's policies would lead to economic disaster. Combine that with an uncharismatic and uninspirational leader, then you might argue no further debate is necessary.Fat chance of that. Defeat breeds resentment, and this one has opened up old divisions.  A chorus of Blairties, led by the man himself, has declared that Ed's problem was ignoring those with aspiration and ambition, failing to appeal to those running business. Incidentally, I've been ticked off by the perspicacious editor of the New Statesman, Jason Cowley, for using the ""unhelpful"" term ""Blairites"".I can't think of another description that fits Tony, Lord Mandelson, Lord Adonis and David Miliband quite so well. But call them what you will, the message was clear - Ed was too left wing, Labour should move back to the centre, or, if you like, to the right.Reading Mr Blair's pithy analysis, listening to Lord Mandelson's gripping and savage eloquence, describing a party sent out to shout: ""We love the poor and hate the rich,"" and so ignoring the middle, and you realise strong emotions are in play.But back to the future may not be sufficient. Of course elections are won on the centre ground. But grandees grinding axes, affronted by the failure of boys who used to make their tea, may be creating so much noise that they can't hear more insistent sounds.  For there are several elephants trumpeting loudly as they cram into the small space of the shadow cabinet room. Imagine these beasts are as gaily decorated as Berlin buddy bears. One is decked out in red, another in imperial purple bunting, and another, a mammoth, strong tusked and ice rimmed, painted yellow with tartan trimmings.Take the last first. The Scottish wipeout is Labour's biggest problem. Fail to solve it, and Labour can forget ever having a comfortable majority again. It is hard to argue Labour were wiped out in Scotland because the SNP outflanked them to the right with their appeal to the business community and the ambitious and aspirational. But it is true the SNP drew in to people from left, right and centre, just as the modernisers say Labour should. It was the politics of economic self-interest, but cast in a very different light. Tribally sneering at ""the reactionary ideology of nationalism"" as Mr Blair does, will not reach the central belt of Scotland, the middle ground of  Midlothian.What about that purple pachyderm?  In Crawley - in fact in seat after seat - there is a similar pattern.  Labour did, in fact, often increase the size of their vote. So did the Conservatives, usually by a bit more. But the real dynamic was the total collapse of the Lib Dems and the dramatic rise of UKIP. The increase in votes for Nigel Farage's party wasn't translated into parliamentary seats, but, although it is early days in terms of research, it probably hurt Labour a lot. If we believe - and I do - Matthew Goodwin and Rob Ford, authors of Revolt on the Right, these voters are often former Labour supporters - older, less educated, those left behind on the tides of  globalisation, stranded on the shores of post-industrialisation. They may have had too many disappointments to feel much ambition or aspiration. They are a challenge for Labour, and any new leader will spend a good deal of time thinking how to deal with the concerns of Europe and immigration.Whether to share their fears, or confront them will be a big decision.Which brings us to Red Nellie. Those members who still proudly call themselves socialist. This is not about Old Labour - they are more likely to be baristas or barristers than boilermakers. It is easy as an outsider, as a journalist, to treat politics as an intellectual game about how best to win power - but many people, particularly the foot soldiers, particularly after the death of  purely tribal loyalties, are in it because they passionately believe in winning  power to do something specific.Many of them are suspicious of the later incarnations of New Labour, not because it reached an accommodation with wealth and business, but because it seemed to worship at the same altar, to regard the party's core beliefs in redistribution and equality as childish fantasies from a past age.Perhaps to Mr Blair, they are the problem, people who may equate ""ambition"" with greed. They might point out that a man who claims to be worth ""only"" £20m may find it harder than most to squeeze through the eye of a needle to understand their point of view. Most successful Labour leaders will confront the left at some point, but the concerns of this group go to the existential question ""What is the party for?""This is not a polemic - not an argument about what should be done, but a reflection on the complex conundrums that will face any new Labour leader, the tearing apart of the old alliance that made up a Labour majority, and so the political need to satisfy groups with very different, indeed, contradictory demands. But looking for a Social Democratic universal theory of everything may be missing the point. What the party desperately wants is a leader who can pull the disparate threads together and articulate them as common purpose. Whether she or he exists is another matter.Much more on that in the coming months."
2015-05-06,'Take us with you',https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-32736153,"Thousands of people in the north of England have been using the hashtag ""take us with you Scotland"" to express their upset about the result of last week's general election, and Scottish nationalists are welcoming this English minority with open arms. Last Thursday's general election was a rough one for the Labour Party in its traditional stronghold in the north of England. But further to the north, the left-leaning Scottish National Party won nearly every seat it contested. That political contrast has made some left-wing voters in places like Manchester, Leeds and Sheffield look fondly on their neighbours. Since last Thursday's election in Britain the phrase ""take us with you Scotland"" has been used more than 24,000 times. ""Genuinely beginning to wonder if the North of England becoming a part of Scotland would be better for us, I really am,"" tweeted Aaron Miller from Yorkshire. Some cracked jokes under the tag after the North West Motorway Police account, which gives traffic updates, announced that they had ""picked up a pedestrian on the M62 who was trying to walk to Scotland.""After an initial spike of jokes over the weekend, the hashtag really took off when users start to mobilise in support of around a year-old petition on the campaigning site Change.org. The petition calls for the north of England to secede from the rest of the country and join up with Scotland, and more than 12,000 people have signed it.Its creator, a Sheffield resident who calls himself ""Stu Dent"", set it up to coincide with last year's Scottish independence referendum, and he also created a map imagining the boundary of a ""Scotland plus the north"" country.Stu Dent runs the Twitter account Hunters Bar, named after an area of southwest Sheffield which is very popular with - you guessed it - students. Despite the account having thousands of followers on Twitter, when the map was first posted last year, the image was shared only about 100 times - however, in the past week it's been retweeted by thousands. Stu Dent told BBC Trending that he was surprised at how popular his idea has become. ""In hindsight, perhaps I shouldn't have been,"" he said. ""There is a huge frustration in parts of the UK about the things that have happened since 2010.""""I think people need a place to go where they can say 'not in my name! This is not the England I want',"" he added. But in addition to disappointment from some quarters about the election result, there might be another reason why the petition is getting a boost now: the power of the Scottish Nationalists on Twitter. What started as a post-election joke in the North of England was quickly embraced by the so-called ""Cyber Nats"" - and a trend was born.The SNP's social media strategist Ross Colquhoun expressed the party's mood about the hashtag best, in a post which was shared more than 500 times. ""2014: #LetsStayTogether 2015: #TakeUsWithYouScotland What a difference a year makes"" he tweeted.Blog by Hannah HendersonNext story: The sport reporter and the obscene ranter who lost his jobFollow BBC Trending on Twitter @BBCtrending, and find us on Facebook."
2015-05-06,What Britain wants from Europe,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32695399,"David Cameron says he has a mandate to pursue EU reform following the Conservatives' general election victory. The PM, who will be hoping his majority government will give him extra leverage in Brussels, wants to renegotiate the terms of the UK's membership ahead of a referendum by the end of 2017. He has said he will campaign for Britain to remain in the EU if he gets the reforms he wants.Mr Cameron has said he does not want to reveal full details of his negotiating hand but he has given a broad indication, in a series of speeches and newspaper articles, of his priorities when he goes into talks with other EU leaders.These are: The prime minister has said Britain would resist any move towards a European Army and that he wants to free British police forces from EU interference. He has also ruled out Britain joining the euro.But he has placed less emphasis in recent years on demanding changes to EU social policy, such as the maximum 48-hour working week, agency workers, maternity leave and non-discrimination rules.The official UK government position is that a referendum will be held by the end of 2017 but Downing Street sources have said: ""If we can do it earlier we will.""There is speculation David Cameron is planning to hold the vote in 2016 to avoid a clash with French and German elections in 2017.The prime minister wants treaty change but even if the referendum was held in 2017 there may not be enough time to legally incorporate any reforms into a treaty and it would have to be done at a later stage.An early referendum would anger Eurosceptics who believe it would not allow enough time to make the case for exit or negotiate any meaningful concessions.""A rushed process would severely undermine the chances to secure a significant deal that both British business and voters could support and would waste the opportunity of a lifetime,"" Matthew Elliott, chief executive of Business for Britain told Breitbart London.The question is always crucial in any referendum and there is already a debate about what it should be. The Draft European Union (Referendum) Bill, published by the Conservatives in 2013, proposed this form of words: ""Do you think that the United Kingdom should remain a member of the European Union?""Some thought that leaned too far towards the status quo, encouraging a yes vote, and the Electoral Commission said it was not clear and direct enough. The watchdog proposed this form of words instead: ""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union?""The new Conservative government will attempt to repeal the Human Rights Act, which requires UK courts to treat the European Court of Human Rights as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. The European Court of Human Rights is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe (CoE), which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine.The freedom for people to move around Europe, enshrined in the EU treaties, works in parallel with the other three basic freedoms in the single market: freedom of goods, capital and services.It is likely to be a ""red line"" for other EU leaders, who do not want to see it eroded.Mr Cameron has steered clear of tackling it directly - for example by asking for an emergency ""brake"" on free movement, or a cap on numbers - focusing instead on reducing the incentive provided by welfare payments. In a speech last November, David Cameron set out measures to reduce the number of EU nationals moving to the UK.His main proposals were:Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission, has said he is ready to work with Mr Cameron to ""strike a fair deal for the United Kingdom in the EU"". The leaders of other EU nations have previously warned they are unlikely to support major changes to EU treaties to accommodate British demands. But Mr Cameron's general election victory may have given him extra leverage. ""The ball is very much in the court of the UK now,"" a senior EU official told The Guardian. ""It's up to the British to define what they want."" The key figure will be German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is very keen to keep Britain in the EU but has so far been unwilling to make major concessions to enable that to happen. There are fears that a ""pick and mix"" approach to EU treaties would undermine EU cohesion.Mr Cameron has said there is ""no doubt"" his planned reforms will require changes to the treaties governing the European Union. But this would require the unanimous support of all EU members, and may not be possible within the deadline he has set of a referendum before the end of 2017. Any attempt to change EU laws on free movement would meet fierce resistance from some EU nations, particularly Eastern European states. Mr Juncker has said free movement is non-negotiable.Mr Cameron may find it difficult to get unanimous support for his proposals for a four-year waiting period for migrant workers claiming UK benefits. East European EU members would be likely to oppose this, on the grounds that it would discriminate against their citizens.  Attempts to secure opt-outs for the City are unlikely to go down well with other European leaders.However, there are precedents for EU treaty changes to accommodate some countries' specific concerns - for example, the protocol attached to the Lisbon Treaty for Ireland.Mr Cameron has faced repeated calls to say whether he would campaign for Britain's exit from the EU in the referendum if he fails to get what he wants from the renegotiation process. All he has said is that he will ""rule nothing out"". Some Conservative MPs want Britain to leave the EU no matter what David Cameron manages to renegotiate. A larger group are likely to want more concessions than Mr Cameron has so far indicated he is prepared to demand.Senior backbencher David Davis, who was defeated by Mr Cameron for the Tory leadership in 2005, told the Daily Telegraph the majority of the 332 Conservative MPs want Mr Cameron to negotiate an ""opt-out"" power to stop individual EU laws from applying to Britain. The prime minister has said this would be ""impossible"" without Britain leaving the EU.Mr Davis claims as many as 60 Tory MPs would be prepared to rebel and vote for Britain's exit from the EU if the prime minister fails to deliver.Graham Brady, chairman of the Tory backbench 1922 committee, which represents backbenchers, has urged David Cameron to give all Conservative MPs, including ministers, a free vote in the EU referendum.In January, Mr Cameron warned that serving cabinet ministers would have to quit the government if they wanted to campaign to leave the EU if he had secured the reforms to it he wants.In the 1975 referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Economic Community, as the EU was then called, Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson decided to suspend collective responsibility because his cabinet was split on the issue. Ministers were allowed to vote with their consciences and campaign against each other. The majority of them, including Mr Wilson, joined the Yes camp, but left-wingers, such as Tony Benn, played a leading role in the No campaign. The Yes campaign won easily with 67% of the vote."

2015-05-07,Scots Labour leader Murphy to resign,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32760196,"Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy is to resign next month, he has announced.It comes despite Mr Murphy narrowly surviving a vote of no confidence at a meeting of the party's national executive in Glasgow. Mr Murphy said he would tender his resignation alongside a plan to reform the party.He lost his seat in last week's general election as the SNP won 56 of the 59 Scottish seats, leaving Labour with a single MP in Scotland.Mr Murphy said he wanted to have a successor as leader in place by the summer, and confirmed he would not be standing for a seat at the Scottish Parliament in next year's election. Instead, he said it was time to ""do something else"" and that he believed the party would continue to be divided if he remained as leader. His deputy, Kezia Dugdale MSP, will become acting leader until a permanent successor is found. Mr Murphy had faced calls to resign from several MSPs, trade unions and former MPs in the wake of his party's near wipeout at the general election.He insisted he had decided to stand down ahead of the national executive voting by 17-14 in favour of him staying in the job.Speaking at a media conference after the national executive meeting, he said: ""It is clear that a small minority who didn't accept my election as leader of the Scottish Labour Party just five months ago won't accept the vote of the executive today and that will continue to divide the party.""Today I received more support in the executive vote than I did from members of the executive when I stood for election five months ago.""He said it would be up to the executive whether to accept the reforms he would be proposing before he left the post. But he warned: ""A party in such urgent need of reform blocks those changes at its peril.""The former East Renfrewshire MP said Labour had been crushed between ""two nationalisms"" in Scotland and England.Mr Murphy said he left no legacy of bitterness for anyone in the Labour Party, and the only person he was angry at was the person who blamed Scottish Labour for the party's UK-wide general election defeat - a reference to Unite leader Len McCluskey.And he said that in many ways Scottish Labour was the ""least modernised part of the Labour movement"" and that he wanted his successor to be elected under a one member, one vote system.Mr Murphy added: ""The Labour Party's problem is not the link with trade unions, or even the relationship with Unite members - far from it. It is the destructive behaviour of one high profile trade unionist.""The leader of the Scottish Labour Party doesn't serve at the grace of Len McCluskey, and the next leader of the UK Labour Party should not be picked by Len McCluskey.""Mr McCluskey has been a vocal critic of Mr Murphy's leadership and opposed his appointment in December when Mr Murphy won the contest to replace Johann Lamont.Jim Murphy laughed and joked with Scottish Labour's sole MP as he made his way down the hotel corridor to announce his resignation.He certainly brought energy and dynamism to his election campaign - but all that achieved was Ian Murray in Edinburgh South.So as Mr Murphy bows out, who could replace him?The deputy leader Kezia Dugdale may want to step up or Neil Findlay could try again after challenging last time. Maybe the party's finance spokeswoman Jackie Baillie thinks her steady hand could steer the ship.Jenny Marra is also often talked about as future face of the party.Whoever steps into Jim Murphy's red shoes he or she will have to face a difficult 2016 Holyrood election, to put it mildly.There are also more fundamental questions about how the party can possibly move on as it faces a surging SNP.Mr Murphy was very much a creature of ""New Labour"" - but to today's generation that's old Labour.Party members may start looking for someone with no links to the past, neither a Brownite nor a Blairite. A 'cleanskin' - as the politicos put it - may well help re-connect with voters.That's a long way from now though - even some of the party's opponents may view this latest train wreck with a modicum of sympathy. Ms Lamont had resigned after claiming Scottish Labour was treated like a ""branch office"" by the London-based party leadership.Mr Murphy concluded his speech by saying: ""Scotland needs a strong Labour party; Scotland needs a united Labour party. We have been the greatest force for change in our nation's remarkable history. ""The Scottish Labour party will rise again. It will be under someone else's leadership and I am confident about my party's future.""Harriet Harman MP, acting leader of the UK Labour Party, said it would be for Scottish Labour to choose a new leader. She added: ""As a cabinet minister and leader of his party in Scotland, Jim has been a hugely important figure in the Labour Party. He leaves with the best wishes and thanks of our movement.""Labour peer Lord McConnell, a former Scottish first minister, said the party's problems were ""much deeper than one individual and one affiliate"".He said: ""We have a disconnect locally and nationally with wider Scottish society. ""We have a problem with our political positioning in the post devolution age where the party particularly at the UK level has never been comfortable with success in the Scottish parliament and has always tried to see things through a UK prism rather than a Scottish prism.""We need to find a new generation, a new leader, new generation, new ideas, a fresh approach.""In a tweet, Scottish first minister and SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said: ""I wish Jim Murphy all the very best for the future. Leadership is not easy and he deserves credit for standing up for what he believes in.""Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson also reacted on Twitter, saying: ""Jim Murphy announces a managed exit in order to help the party, which is to his credit. But leaves a tough gig for whoever comes next.""The meeting of Scottish Labour's executive was disrupted by protesters who entered the party's headquarters.Police were called and the protesters, who included persistent anti-austerity activists Sean Clerkin and Piers Doughty-Brown, left the building to protest further from the street outside.The protesters were calling for Mr Murphy to remain as leader to ""finish the job of destroying Scottish Labour"".A Police Scotland spokeswoman said officers had been called and found two protestors on the third floor of the building. She added: ""Both left on police arrival. Advice and assistance was given."""
2015-05-07,Labour contenders clash on spending,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32761561,"Prospective Labour leaders have clashed over Labour's record in government in their first public debate in the race to succeed Ed Miliband.Former cabinet ministers including Yvette Cooper and Andy Burnham defended Labour's fiscal record and spending on schools and hospitals.However, candidates from the 2010 intake of MPs argued that the party spent too much while in office.The debate followed Chuka Umunna's withdrawal from the leadership contest.The remaining candidates appeared at the annual conference of the Progress think tank in London.There was agreement that Labour needed to demonstrate economic credibility to regain power, with shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt telling the meeting that the party needed to be ""trusted with public finances and the family finances"".Mr Hunt, who was first elected to Parliament in 2010 when Labour lost power, argued the last Labour government ""spent too much"" and failed to ""leave enough economic headroom to deal with the economic crisis and the recession"".Shadow health minister Liz Kendall said: ""There's absolutely nothing progressive about spending more on debt interest payments than on educating our children.""But shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: ""The Tories have had a triumph of spin over the facts in saying what they said about the economic record of the last Labour government.""The former chief secretary to the Treasury said the deficit did ""grow too large"" in the government's later years but insisted: ""The last Labour government ran more surpluses in its first term than the Tories did in 18 years.""Yvette Cooper, another former chief secretary to the Treasury, said: ""We should never let anybody tell us that it was too many teachers, doctors or nurses that caused Lehman Brothers bank in New York to crash.""Shadow international development secretary Mary Creagh said: ""People have forgotten the economic credibility that the last Labour government had.""She said Labour had built schools and hospitals that were ""treasured in our communities"".Ms Cooper, Mr Burnham, Ms Kendall and Ms Creagh have declared their intention to run for leader, while Mr Hunt told the conference he would make an announcement next week.At the same event, shadow energy secretary Caroline Flint announced she would be running for deputy leader.The Don Valley MP told the Today programme ahead of the debate that Labour lost the election because ""fundamentally the public did not trust us on the economy"".Exeter MP Ben Bradshaw has already announced a bid to be deputy, saying Labour ""must and could win the next election"", but only if it ""broadens its appeal by adopting sensible, centre-left politics which celebrate wealth creation and entrepreneurship"".Former Labour campaign co-ordinator Tom Watson is reported to be crowd-funding a deputy leadership bid, while Walthamstow MP Stella Creasy has said she is ""open to the question"" of running.Barnsley East MP and shadow transport secretary Michael Dugher - a fierce critic of Ed Miliband's election campaign - is to run Mr Burnham's campaign, according to the website LabourList.It is reported that Mr Burnham also has the backing of Labour peer Lord Falconer, who was lord chancellor and justice secretary under Tony Blair and was close to the former PM.Shadow culture secretary Chris Bryant has signalled his backing for Ms Cooper, tweeting that the next leader must be ""someone who's been tried in the fiery furnace of public opinion"".Mr Hunt said on Friday he would be be attending the debate - along with the other four hopefuls - to ""set out my analysis on how we begin to understand what went so wrong and why"".He added: ""We must use this leadership election to ask some very profound questions.""All voices in the party must be heard so that we can have a full and proper assessment as to why the politics of nationalism triumphed in Scotland and huge swathes of England, and how we have allowed the Conservative Party to present a more compelling vision for Britain to so many millions of people.""Speculation still surrounds shadow business secretary Mr Umunna's decision to pull out on Friday, when he said he was not ""comfortable"" with the ""pressure"" of being a candidate.As well as citing extensive pressure and scrutiny Mr Umunna also said he was ruling himself out because of concerns about the impact of the bid on his family.A rising star of the party, Mr Umunna was first elected to Parliament in 2010 - alongside Tristram Hunt and Liz Kendall - before joining the shadow cabinet.Asked about the candidate who might win, Conservative Chancellor George Osborne said: ""The Labour leadership contest has descended into farce.""But it's not actually about personalities. I don't think the Labour Party any more represents the working people of this country who aspire to a better life."""

I'm not suggesting he takes a break from being leader.""Clearly the national executive has the authority, they're the ruling body. ""I'm told that they made a decision. I'm told it was a procedurally correct decision, he is the leader but I think it's important that as leader he takes a break and I think it's important that we work out how these complex questions are answered by a team.""No one person has all the answers. I'm particularly concerned about tone, making sure we get a tone that ensures that the 27 million people who didn't vote for UKIP last week may be persuaded to vote for us in future.""The party has been beset by wrangling since Mr Farage agreed to stay on as leader, days after standing down after failing to get elected in Thanet South.He had pledged before the general election that he would quit the post if he failed to get elected to Parliament.Senior aide Matthew Richardson has left the party, following claims from MEP Patrick O'Flynn that Mr Farage had fallen under the influence of ""inexperienced"" advisers.UKIP has also confirmed the departure of Mr Farage's chief of staff Raheem Kassam.Mr Farage ruled out quitting as leader on BBC's Question Time on Thursday, saying he had ""phenomenal"" support, and has challenged his critics to decide whether they want to stay in the party.In his article, Mr Carswell had said that ""knowing how difficult it is to lead a party makes me admire Nigel Farage all the more"".""I know that I never could,"" he added, stressing that he would find it ""impossible to simultaneously lead UKIP, be the voice of the party in the Commons, represent my Clacton constituents and at the same time be a husband and a dad"".However, he said that ""even leaders need to take a break"", adding: ""Nigel needs to take a break now.""UKIP got nearly four million votes at the election, but returned only one MP - former Conservative Mr Carswell in the Clacton constituency."
2015-05-07,Coasting schools 'must improve',https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/education-32763097,"Education Secretary Nicky Morgan has said new powers to sack head teachers in coasting schools will show ""it is not OK to be just above the level of failing"". Under the plans, ministers could force schools rated as ""requiring improvement"" and missing new government benchmarks to become an academy.Coasting schools have average results which have often flatlined over time.Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, Mrs Morgan said faster action was needed.She said: ""Our big priorities will be to speed up the process for tackling failing schools; extend our academies programme to tackle 'coasting' schools; and deliver on our commitment to open new free schools.""The proposals will be in a new bill due to be introduced in the Queen's Speech. ""First, we will take new powers to step in from the moment that a school is found to be failing,"" Mrs Morgan said.""From day one, regional schools commissioners will be able to bring in new leadership and support from other excellent schools and heads, and we will speed up the process of turning schools into academies to make sure that new expert leadership is found for all schools that need it as quickly as possible.""She said that coasting schools will be put on an immediate notice to improve and could then be taken over and turned into an academy.They will be required to work with a team of ""expert"" head teachers.She said: ""Those that aren't able to demonstrate a clear plan for improvement will be given new leadership - we know this works in turning schools around.""More than 3,300 schools in England are labelled ""requires improvement"", but the plans are unlikely to cover that many schools.Under the current system, secondary schools are considered to be failing, and therefore eligible for intervention, if fewer than 40% of their students score at least five Cs at GCSE, including English and maths, and they do not meet national averages in pupil progress.In primary schools, the threshold for intervention is if fewer than 65% of pupils get Level 4 in reading, writing and maths and a below average number of pupils make the expected amount of progress.It is not yet clear how coasting schools will be deemed in need of intervention.It is understood that a new category will be devised covering schools which are rated as ""requires improvement"" and which fail to meet a new set of standards on improvement."
2015-05-07,Co-op Group to keep political funding,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-32762858,"The Co-operative Group has decided to continue financially supporting the Co-operative Party, which has strong ties to Labour.Members of the group, the UK's biggest mutual organisation, voted on the issue at their annual general meeting.They passed a motion by 48,579 for, to 39,479 against, to approve ""political expenditures"" of up to £1m which support the movement's objectives.Last year the Co-op Group gave £625,000 to the Co-op Party.This figure was down on the sums donated in previous years. The AGM also included a vote on new corporate governance procedures which would mean members having less of a direct say.The Co-operative Group is still recovering from a period of financial mismanagement and some members have recently expressed concerns about how elections to the board are chosen.The banking arm of the group came close to collapse in 2013, bringing the whole group to a £2.5bn annual loss that year. The Co-op Party includes among its members a number of Labour MPs, including shadow chancellor Chris Leslie and Walthamstow MP Stella Creasy. The politicians stand as candidates of both the Co-operative Party and the Labour Party, and the two political movements have strong historical ties. The board asked the members of the Co-operative Group whether they wanted to continue financially supporting the Co-operative Party, or any other party. Allan Leighton, chairman of the Co-op Group, said: ""There's a clear remit from the members to continue to support the Labour Party.""It allows us to now have a conversation with the Co-op Labour Party about what we do next.""There was also a members' motion on the agenda, put forward by those in favour of making political donations of up to £1m a year.The motion to approve political funding ""not to exceed £1m per annum"" was carried by 55.17% to 44.83%.BBC business correspondent Joe Lynam said: ""To meet a £1.5bn hole in its accounts - mostly stemming from its banking division - the Co-op Group has had to sell off parts of its businesses and hand over majority control of its bank to American hedge funds.""It's also in the process of radically changing the way it runs itself into a more corporate structure with less of a direct say by its members.""He said that ""in theory"", each of the 2.8 million Co-op members could vote on a series of motions about the reforms, as well as how its bosses are paid, and retaining the links to the Co-operative party.One of the group's largest independent societies, Midcounties, recently threatened legal action over a shortlist of six candidates for the group's board being reduced to three - the number of positions available - before a member vote.

2015-05-07,Osborne plans July 'stability' Budget,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32761566,"Chancellor George Osborne has said that he will deliver a new Budget on 8 July.He claimed it would have ""a laser-like focus"" on raising productivity and living standards.He said he was making the unusual move of having a second Budget in one year in order to ""deliver on the commitments we have made to working people"".Labour said the chancellor would have to set out ""who is going to pay"" for what it called ""uncosted promises"" in the election campaign.Speaking outside 11 Downing Street, the chancellor gave a broad outline of his plans for the forthcoming Budget but refused to be drawn on the details, including the Conservatives' planned £12bn of welfare cuts.""I don't want to wait to deliver on the commitments we have made to working people,"" he said.""It will continue with the balanced plan we have to deal with our debts, invest in our health service and reform welfare to make work pay.""But there will also be a laser-like focus on making our economy more productive so we raise living standards across our country.""We're going to put Britain into good shape for the long term.""The last Budget was held on 18 March and included tax cuts for first-time house buyers.Writing in the Sun, Mr Osborne admitted it was ""unusual"" to have two Budgets in the same year, but he wanted to turn ""promises made in the election into a reality"".Again, Mr Osborne did not specifically outline how the Conservatives plan to fulfil a pledge to cut £12bn in welfare spending but said he wants to make the welfare system ""fair for the people who pay for it"".He writes: ""We will protect the NHS and give it more funding each and every year, while making savings across Whitehall. ""We'll crack down hard on tax avoidance and aggressive tax planning by the rich - because everyone should pay their fair share.  ""We will always protect the most vulnerable, but we also need a welfare system that's fair to the people who pay for it. If you can work you should be working, so we'll take the next steps in our benefit reforms to make sure that happens.""Second, we've got to go on helping businesses create jobs in Britain, so we move towards full employment. That means facing a hard truth: in Britain we produce about a quarter less for every hour we work than countries like America or Germany. Fixing that long-running productivity weakness is the big challenge for the next five years.""So in the Budget we'll spend less on welfare, and instead invest to create three million more apprenticeships, so that young people can learn a trade, get better jobs and earn more.""After the Budget in March independent forecaster the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said that Mr Osborne needed to spell out exactly how he plans to cut £12bn from welfare spending.Of those £12bn planned cuts, £2bn were outlined ahead of the general election - all the cuts are supposed to be in place by 2017-18.Labour's shadow energy and climate change secretary, Caroline Flint, accused the Tories of making ""a number of uncosted promises"" during the election campaign.She told the BBC: ""It will be interesting to see who is going to pay for those uncosted policies when they bring the Budget in July."""

If it isn't, stop it and do something else.""He also criticised Mr Farage's comments about HIV patients during the TV leaders' debate last month.While debating about the NHS, Mr Farage said: ""You can come into Britain from anywhere in the world and get diagnosed with HIV and get the retro-viral drugs that cost up to £25,000 per year per patient.""Mr Carswell wrote: ""By all means we should highlight the problem of health tourism. But we need to admit that using the example of HIV patients to make the point was ill-advised.""He said the party needed to strike ""the right tone"" and added: ""UKIP has been at its most persuasive when we have been most optimistic.""Anger is never a great way to motivate people - at least not for very long.""The party has been beset by wrangling since Mr Farage agreed to stay on as leader, days after standing down after failing to get elected in Thanet South.He had pledged before the general election that he would quit the post if he failed to get elected to Parliament.Matthew Richardson has left the party, following claims from MEP Patrick O'Flynn that Mr Farage had fallen under the influence of ""inexperienced"" advisers.

They absolutely loved how he helped them and he was a highly-regarded local MP,"" Mr Bone said.""He stood up for what was right rather than what the party line was. In those days - the John Major years - it was much more difficult to stand up against the party machine. He had strong views on Europe.""Sir Peter started his career as an insurance broker, joining the Wycombe Young Conservatives in 1949 and the Oxford University Conservative Association in 1951.He went on to become a Conservative councillor on Buckinghamshire County Council between 1961 and 1967.Wellingborough mayor-elect Barry Graves also paid tribute to Sir Peter, remembering him as a ""very strong constituency MP"".""I remember going out and canvassing with him and he would go everywhere. He knew the area and the people. He was very much a man of the local constituency.""He was ""a very approachable man"", Mr Graves added.Sir Peter was knighted in 1994. "

2015-05-07,PM will 'look at' powers proposals,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32746049,"David Cameron has said he would ""look at"" any proposals for further powers for Scotland but wants to get the Smith Commission plans implemented first.The prime minister was speaking after meeting Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon in Edinburgh.Mr Cameron said he made a ""commitment"" to include a devolution bill in the Queen's Speech later this month.Ms Sturgeon argued the Smith Commission proposals were ""a good starting point"" but did not go far enough.The prime minister has pledged to include a bill on devolution in this month's Queen's Speech which would be based on the cross-party Smith Commission agreement. The Smith proposals included giving Holyrood the power to set income tax rates and bands, as well as control over a share of VAT and some welfare benefits. But Ms Sturgeon's SNP also wants the Scottish Parliament to be given powers over business taxes, employment law, the minimum wage and additional powers over welfare.Speaking after meeting Ms Sturgeon, Mr Cameron told the BBC: ""Let's make sure Smith is implemented in full. I'm going to keep the commitment I made to the people of Scotland. Let's get that done first because it does create a really strong Scottish Parliament.""He added: ""Of course, if people want to make future proposals I'll look at them.""The prime minister again said he did not support full fiscal autonomy for Scotland - the responsibility for all areas of tax and spending except defence and foreign affairs - stating that it would mean £7bn of cuts or extra tax-raising.What Nicola Sturgeon is trying to say is she has a mandate. She has 56 out of the 59 MPs elected in Scotland and she won 50% of the vote - unprecedented here in Scotland.She says that gives her leverage to push David Cameron. David Cameron says he wants to keep the nation together.The language coming out of Westminster last week was very much a cordial one. 'We will listen'.Nicola Sturgeon has warned him that if he doesn't listen, then the people of Scotland will judge him accordingly.Ms  Sturgeon described the hour-long talks at her official residence at Bute House as ""constructive and business-like"". She said Mr Cameron had made a ""commitment"" that the Smith proposals would be implemented ""as agreed"".""But secondly the prime minister agreed that he would look at proposals that we would now send to suggest the areas we can go beyond Smith,"" Ms Sturgeon said.""There was no agreement in terms of the substance of that but we will submit those proposals, the prime minister has said they will consider them and there will be a meeting to look at how we take that further forward.""Referring to her party's success in last week's general election, which saw the SNP win 56 out of 59 Scottish seats, Ms Sturgeon said: ""People in Scotland have now voted fairly convincingly for the SNP and sent a message that we want the Smith Commission proposals to go further and be built on.""The ball is in his court but I'm going into this in good faith.""She added: ""David Cameron and I are a world apart politically but, where we can, I'm determined to do business in the interests of the people of Scotland and across the UK.""She said she would have a ""constructive and business-like"" relationship with the prime minister. The two leaders shook hands on the front steps of Bute House as Mr Cameron arrived. Mr Cameron left the building shortly before 11:00, almost an hour after he had arrived.The two sides agreed to hold more regular discussions in the future, possibly quarterly. "
2015-05-07,Umunna withdraws Labour leader bid,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32748106,"Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna has withdrawn from the Labour party leadership contest, just days after throwing his hat into the ring.The MP, 36, said in a statement that he was not comfortable with the level of pressure and scrutiny that came with being a leadership candidate.Mr Umunna also cited concerns about the impact of the bid on his family.BBC political editor Nick Robinson said the MP's team insisted no ""unwelcome press story"" lay behind the move.But Mr Umunna had been shocked by the level of scrutiny of himself, his mother, sister and girlfriend, he said.You can follow the latest reaction here.A rising star of the party, Mr Umunna was first elected to Parliament in 2010 before joining the shadow cabinet.He confirmed his candidacy for the Labour leadership via a post on his Facebook page on 12 May, saying the party under Ed Miliband had failed to appeal to enough voters in England.But on Friday he said he had not found the leadership bid to be ""a comfortable experience"".I understand that Chuka Umunna has told friends that ""this is not right for me or people close to me. I'm human, the rest of my life is more important to me than politics.""The shadow business secretary has been distressed by the degree of scrutiny he, his family and his girlfriend have come under since he declared his intention to stand for the labour leadership.I am told that this includes reporters waiting outside the houses of relatives late at night.Friends of Mr Umunna deny that he is nervous of not getting the support of enough MPs to run for the leadership; they point out that he already has half the necessary names and that there are some weeks to go.The shadow business secretary now wants to play a leading role in arguing that Britain should stay in the EU and does not rule out seeking the leadership in the future.He said he thought he had understood ""the scrutiny and attention a leadership contest would bring"", but added: ""However, since the night of our defeat last week I have been subject to the added level of pressure that comes with being a leadership candidate.""The shadow business secretary said he had wondered if it was too soon for him to stand for the leadership, and ""I fear it was."" He also cited concerns about the impact on ""the rest of one's life"" and those close to him.""Consequently, after further reflection, I am withdrawing my candidacy,"" he said.Mr Umunna said he would continue to serve as shadow business secretary and hoped to ""play a leading role"" in Labour's campaign to keep the UK in the EU during the forthcoming in/out referendum.Commenting on the news, Labour former culture secretary Ben Bradshaw - who is expected to run for deputy leader - said Mr Umunna was a ""terrible loss"" to the field.He told the BBC's Daily Politics the Streatham MP had been the candidate the Conservative Party ""feared the most"".""And if it's the result of pressure on an extended family or an extended group of friends, I think that's a very sad reflection on our political culture,"" he said.Chuka Umunna feels ""liberated"", he told me, by his decision to quit the Labour leadership race.He hopes to be given a good role (shadow chancellor, I wonder?) by whoever becomes Labour leader. And I expect he'll become very high profile in the campaign to keep Britain in Europe, which is increasingly looking like it will be next May.He'll endorse a candidate in the next four weeks before nominations close. It will be very interesting to see who he piles in behind.Read more from Allegra (see post 13.23).Former Labour leader Lord Kinnock said he thought Mr Umunna had made the right decision.He said: ""If he felt in his soul that he wasn't prepared to subject himself - and more importantly his family - to the kind of attention which is fairly typical, sadly, these days, he has done absolutely the right thing.""There is no point at all in inflicting avoidable, unnecessary misery on those you love most.""Leadership contender Mary Creagh said she had ""huge respect"" for Mr Umunna, telling BBC Radio 4's World at One programme it took ""courage"" to withdraw from the leadership race.Mr Umunna was ""a big beast"" and would play a ""big role"" in the future of the Labour Party, she added.Yvette Cooper, Andy Burnham, Liz Kendall and Mary Creagh have already thrown their hats into the ring for Labour's top job while a number of other potential candidates, including Dan Jarvis, Alan Johnson and David Lammy, have ruled themselves out. Candidates must secure nominations from 34 colleagues - 15% of the party's MPs - by 15 June to make it on to ballot papers, which will be sent to members in August ahead of the leader's election a month later."

However, Mr Justice Stuart Smith at Southwark Crown Court said there was a ""very strong likelihood"" a custodial sentence would follow.The jury heard how Mote submitted numerous false expenses claims for payment for work that organisations had allegedly carried out on his behalf.Mote claimed the money was to pay whistleblowers in cash through third parties. He also said he had been ""targeted for being an anti-EU MEP.""During his time an MEP he also made £250,000 legitimate expenses claims.No date has been set for the sentencing."

Governing parties don't gain seats. Parties that have implemented painful cuts and are promising more certainly don't. Until that is the Conservative Party did - achieving what had seemed to be Mission Impossible - a Tory majority.Until that is David Cameron's personal triumph which triggered the near simultaneous resignation of his three principal opponents - Messrs Miliband, Clegg and Farage.   They did so in part because they helped to crush their partners in coalition these last five years - reducing the Liberal Democrat parliamentary party to a size when it can fit into two London taxis and still have two seats to spare. In part because the extraordinary tidal wave of support for the SNP swept dozens of once safe Labour seats away.In part because Nigel Farage persuaded millions to vote for him but secured just one seat - not, though, the one he was standing in.But - and this is critical - because Labour performed worse overall than it had under Gordon Brown in the immediate aftermath of the worst financial crisis of modern times.

2015-05-07,Round-up: BBC experts' analysis,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/election-2015-32650417,"The political future of the United Kingdom has become clearer after the results of the general election emerged around the country.David Cameron says he hopes to govern for all of the UK after the Conservatives took 331 seats - enough to form a slender majority in the Commons.Labour has been all but wiped out by the SNP in Scotland and suffered a disappointing set of results elsewhere, while the Lib Dems are left with just eight MPs after many party heavyweights such as Vince Cable and Danny Alexander lost their seats.So with battles won and lost and the fall-out and celebrations beginning, BBC correspondents examine the implications and challenges that lie ahead for the new government - and for those whose political careers have been ended by voters.No pollster, no pundit, no political leader saw it coming - not even David Cameron himself.Governing parties don't gain seats. Parties that have implemented painful cuts and are promising more certainly don't. Until that is the Conservative Party did - achieving what had seemed to be Mission Impossible - a Tory majority.Until that is David Cameron's personal triumph which triggered the near simultaneous resignation of his three principle opponents - Messrs Miliband, Clegg and Farage.They did so in part because they helped to crush their partners in coalition these last five years - reducing the Liberal Democrat parliamentary party to a size when it can fit into two London taxis and still have two seats to spare.In part because the extraordinary tidal wave of support for the SNP swept dozens of once safe Labour seats away.In part because Nigel Farage persuaded millions to vote for him but secured just one seat - not, though, the one he was standing in.Read more from Nick Robinson hereThe question uppermost in the prime minister's mind as he assembles his new government is how to keep the kingdom united.""Above all I want to bring our country together,"" he revealed after the result, ""to reclaim a mantle we should never have lost - the mantle of one nation, one United Kingdom"".Looking at the political landscape from Land's End today is very different to the view from John O'Groats.A sea of Conservative and Unionist blue dominates the scene across much of England, while a field of SNP nationalist yellow stretches to the horizon and beyond from the north.David Cameron's greatest challenge is to prevent the union he supports being torn apart by mutual resentment - resentment from Scotland at a Westminster government dominated by English Tories, and resentment from England at the preferential treatment people think is being given to the Scots.Those who assumed the future of the Union had been safeguarded by the Scottish referendum must think again.Read more from Mark Easton hereOne thing is rock-solid true: the Conservatives who worked on this campaign are as surprised by the result as the pollsters, pundits, politicians and general population.Maybe they shouldn't be - the economy is in good shape and the Conservatives had incumbency advantage.But when I travelled back from the prime minister's last rally with a group of exhausted Conservative campaign officials it was clear that 290 seats was a hoped-for target.No-one talked about anything over 300 seats, and no-one even mentioned an overall majority.So what special sauce pushed David Cameron into No 10 with a Commons majority?Mr Cameron had two simple messages in the campaign and he rarely veered away from them; the first - the economy is in good shape and the recovery is threatened by Labour. And the second - the SNP would hold a Labour-led government to ransom.Read more from Jonny Dymond hereBrian Taylor, BBC political editor, ScotlandOf all the comments on the overnight apocalypse, undoubtedly the most straightforward came from a defeated Scottish Labour MP.Since there were quite a few of them, let me narrow the focus a little. Come on down, Tom Harris.Mr Harris had plainly anticipated defeat. Nonetheless, he looked suitably lugubrious as his fate was confirmed.Why, he was asked eagerly, had Labour lost? ""Because we did not win enough votes.""Psephologically, it is perfect. Complete in itself. Psychologically, it sums up Labour's gloom without descending into subsidiary matters such as leadership, strategy and the rest. As a forward-thinking strategy, it is ideal. Win more votes. Simple.Read more from Brian Taylor hereThis has been an election which may have more profound consequences than almost any in living memory.We now face a generational decision about our future in Europe, with an EU referendum in two years' time almost certain.There will also be serious questions about the future of the Union, following an SNP landslide that has turned Scotland into a virtual one-party state.David Cameron's victory also represents a colossal achievement.Only once before in recent history has an incumbent government increased its majority - and that was Mrs Thatcher in her prime in the 1980s.It is also a significant personal victory for Mr Cameron and a rebuff for those in his party who had become increasingly sceptical about his ability to win.But while it may represent a defeat for those Tories who saw this election as a potential opportunity to rid themselves of David Cameron, he must now govern with a wafer-thin majority.For the SNP, their stunning victory can only increase the pressure on Nicola Sturgeon to include a commitment to a second independence referendum in her party's manifesto for next year's Scottish elections.It is an election which has not just defied all the predictions of the pollsters and pundits - but which may yet prompt the most fundamental re-casting of British politics for a generation.Read more from Norman Smith hereAfter an extraordinary night, some brief conclusions:Read more from James Landale hereIs this the end of the union?That is the question many people will be asking this morning after the party which has fought for Scottish independence for 80 years swept to victory.The answer from the jubilant Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon is a firm ""No"".She insists that her MPs will speak for all of Scotland, not just for the 45% who voted for the country to leave the United Kingdom last September.In the closing hours of the most extraordinary election campaign which anyone in Scotland can remember, Ms Sturgeon turned to talk of ""legitimacy.""That will be her watchword in the coming days as she argues that the prime minister cannot ignore the democratic will of the Scottish people.Politically, Scotland and England this morning look and feel like very different countries.Read more from James Cook hereAfter weeks of chatter about an election too close to call, it wasn't that close at all.David Cameron will be continuing as our prime minister.So, what is all this likely to mean?A referendum on whether the UK stays in, or leaves, the European Union, within the next two-and-a-half years.A race to be the next leader of the Labour Party.A race to be the next leader of the Liberal Democrats.And a huge new presence of Scottish National Party MPs at Westminster.And so here's another thing we know for certain this morning: Politics ain't going to be boring any time soon.Read more from Chris Mason hereFor Labour the story of their terrible night is rapidly turning into the search for a new leader. So who will that be?Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, is almost certain to run.  Even before this election, both he and another almost inevitable candidate, Chuka Umunna, had raised eyebrows inside the party at the work they had put in, preparing the ground with members and the unions for potential bids.Yvette Cooper, before the election, was still thought not to have made up her mind over whether to run. That decision has been made perhaps a little easier as her husband, Ed Balls, has lost his seat.She is certainly potentially in the frame, along with two lesser known names - Liz Kendall and Dan Jarvis - two MPs who were only elected in 2010 for the first time. This could be their moment. But whoever is in the job, they face a monumental task.Read Laura Kuenssberg's Twitter hereSterling is up (the most for seven years against the euro), share prices are up (especially bank shares like Lloyds and RBS, and energy shares such as Centrica), government bond prices are up.To state the obvious, investors love the Tories' general election victory.There are a few reasons.One (no surprise here) is that Labour's threat of breaking up banks and imposing energy price caps has been lifted.Second is that investors have been discounting days and weeks of wrangling after polling day over who would form the government - and so they are semi-euphoric that we already know who's in charge.Third, many investors tend to be economically conservative and instinctively Conservative.But although the City may be a bit drunk on the result, its pleasure in Ed Miliband's and Ed Balls' humiliation may be making it a bit blind - perhaps dangerously so - to some bumps in the economic road ahead.Read more from Robert Peston hereNigel Farage dreamed of holding the balance of power, but in the end his UKIP party is now worse off than when it came into the election.At the seventh time of asking he was rejected - this time by the people of Thanet South. It was a similar story in Rochester and Strood where Mark Reckless, who sensationally defected from the Tories last year, was also sent packing.In seats on UKIP's target list, like Thurrock in Essex, the party failed to make gains. In Grimsby - where Mr Farage went twice in the last six weeks - they came third.UKIP got around four million votes - with especially strong showings in north-east and south-east England - but it's ended up with just one MP, and a vacancy at the top. This has led to UKIP attacking the current system of choosing MPs, which it's described as ""busted"" and ""dysfunctional"".In one sense, this campaign was a complete failure and it's left an aftermath of angry voters, and others wondering if the UKIP bubble has burst.Read Robin Brant's Twitter hereI monitored 91 GB-wide voting intention polls during the 2015 election campaign and found nothing in them to prepare me for the final outcome.The good news for the pollsters was that their share for the Lib Dems was pretty close, as were the shares for UKIP, the Greens and the catch-all category of Others.The bad news for the polling industry was that the crucial shares for Conservative and Labour were the ones where they came most adrift.When all the qualifications of margins of error are allowed, there did appear to be a systematic overstatement of the Labour share and an equally systematic understatement of the Conservative one.It is for the pollsters to decide whether to conduct a review of their performance but I trust they will avoid the initial knee-jerk reaction of the immediate aftermath of the 1992 polls debacle.This general election performance follows the performance of the polls in the 2014 Scottish referendum where the choice was simply binary and yet all the polls were out by between 4-6%.Something is wrong. A lot of us would like to know what it is.Read more from David Cowling hereThe words ""political earthquake"" have been translated into numerous European languages, making front page news across the continent.While Britons now examine the domestic minutiae of the election result, here in mainland Europe the vote means one thing: a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU. And that has the potential to create an earthquake of its own.The guardian of the EU treaties Mr Cameron wants to change - Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker - has said again he'd listen to what Britain's new government proposed.Read more from Katya Adler here"

2015-05-07,A history of political plots,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32749971,"Nigel Farage has apparently seen off a challenge to his leadership of UKIP - a move described by his former election strategist as a ""coup"". He's not the only party leader to face an attempted ousting. But can you recover from such a revolt?In 2006, the Labour prime minister was the target of what became known as the ""curry house conspiracy"" - a coup to remove him and install his chancellor, Gordon Brown, as prime minister.It would lead to several of the plotters' resignations - but not Mr Blair's. However, it was successful to a degree in that it forced the party leader into naming a departure date.The move against him was reportedly masterminded by Tom Watson, a defence minister at the time, who was also rumoured to have had a secret meeting with Mr Brown on the eve of the revolt.Apparently, Mr Watson and three fellow West Midlands MPs - Sion Simon, David Wright (both ministerial aides) and Khalid Mahmood - met over a biryani at a Wolverhampton curry house to discuss the PM's future, before dispatching a missive calling for him to quit.The letter - which attracted the support of a number of normally loyal Labour MPs - was leaked to the press, and ultimately resulted in Mr Watson's resignation.In his parting letter, the West Bromwich East MP took a shot at the prime minister, who he said should step down in the interests of party and country.Mr Blair denounced his actions and branded the former minister ""disloyal, discourteous and wrong"", saying he would have sacked him if he had not resigned.But Mr Watson's departure was swiftly followed by the resignations of six other junior members of government - who had also signed the rebel letter - in protest at the prime minister's refusal to say when he would step down as Labour leader.The whole affair resulted in Mr Blair announcing his intention to step aside within 12 months - which he duly did, on 27 June 2007.But it did nothing to quash internal dissent and speculation in the party over the future leadership of the party.Labour prime minister Gordon Brown found his leadership under threat in 2009 after one of his cabinet ministers dramatically quit the government and called for him to resign.Work and Pensions Secretary James Purnell - a former aide to Tony Blair - resigned from his post after the polls closed in the local and European elections, in which Labour was forecast to do badly.Explaining his decision to quit, Mr Purnell said the prime minister made a Conservative victory ""more, not less, likely"".It was Mr Brown's first direct challenge from a cabinet minister - but it would not topple the Labour leader as senior members of government refused to follow Mr Purnell's lead.Mr Brown was safe for the time being. But several months later, in January 2010, a fresh leadership challenge was mounted by two senior former Labour cabinet ministers.Geoff Hoon and Patricia Hewitt wrote to all Labour MPs, saying the party was ""deeply divided"" over Mr Brown's leadership and that the best way to resolve the issue was by way of secret ballot.They insisted it was not an ""attempted coup"" but a necessary step to resolve divisions within the party.But the duo could only muster the public support of a handful of backbenchers long-opposed to Mr Brown, with the majority of the party's MPs less than impressed by the move, which came just weeks before the general election.As the day wore on, a succession of cabinet ministers came out to back the PM, suggesting there was little momentum behind the plot - although it was noted that several were not exactly gushing in their support of Mr Brown.As history tells us, neither leadership challenge bore fruit but they reflected the internal doubts and divisions over Mr Brown at the helm.As leadership toppling attempts go, this one in 2014 was regarded as a particularly ""botched"" and ""shambolic coup"". Indeed, former Lib Dem leader Lord (Paddy) Ashdown described the move as a ""plot of deep malice"".Its instigator, Lord (Matthew) Oakeshott - a close ally of the-then Business Secretary Vince Cable - tried to unseat Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg.The peer was found to have commissioned secret polls suggesting the party would do better at the 2015 general election without Mr Clegg in the driving seat.The man Lord Oakeshott had long had in mind to take Mr Clegg's place - Mr Cable, who was on government business in China at the time - was forced to publicly condemn his friend's actions and state his backing for Mr Clegg.But Lord Oakeshott said the business secretary had in fact known about his polls and their findings.Nevertheless, the peer - who was denounced by the Lib Dem leadership for spending money that could have been spent on campaigning - quit the party, and issued a warning shot on his way out about the Lib Dems' future prospects.Mr Cable largely emerged unscathed but he faced questions about his loyalty to the leader. Although the two sought to put paid to reports of a rift with a (painfully awkward, 'nothing to see here, folks') stage-managed pint in a pub.Although the revolt failed, and Mr Clegg remained at the helm, the Lib Dems did go on to suffer a trouncing at the general election, losing nearly 50 of its MPs - one of them, Mr Cable himself - prompting his leader to quit.The Conservatives have a reputation for being more ruthless than their party rivals when it comes to getting rid of leaders they sense are no longer effectual.But, in 1995, Prime Minister John Major - tired of persistent rumours of a leadership challenge - decided to take the bull by the horns and trigger a surprise leadership election to silence his detractors.His own backbenchers had questioned Mr Major's ability to unite and lead the party, which was deeply divided over Europe.So ""put up or shut up"", he told them as he tendered his resignation as Conservative Party leader but not prime minister.But then stepped forward eurosceptic MP John Redwood, who resigned from the cabinet in order to contest Mr Major's leadership.This was unexpected by many, as the PM had said there had been assurances from his cabinet that none would stand against him.But Mr Major went on to win the ensuing election with a comfortable defeat over his challenger, who was not included in the PM's consequent cabinet reshuffle.No further contested leadership election took place until after the Conservatives' defeat at the 1997 general election, paving the way for William Hague to take over the running of the party.Not all attempts to oust a party leader end in failure: as Margaret Thatcher found out to her peril.With three electoral victories under her belt, the Conservative prime minister's downfall would come at the hands of her own party - not the voters.It was on 1 November 1990 when Geoffrey (now Lord) Howe - one of Mrs Thatcher's longest-serving ministers - resigned over differences with the party leader over Europe.In his now infamous speech on the floor of the House of Commons, he attacked the PM's policies and leadership style, comparing being one of her cabinet ministers to opening the batting at cricket only to find his bat had been ""broken... by the team captain"".It sparked the beginning of the end of the 11-year Thatcher reign.Michael (now Lord) Heseltine seized on the opportunity to challenge the prime minister in the ensuing leadership contest, from which she would eventually withdraw and John Major emerge as her successor. Reflecting on the revolt and its implications on the Conservative Party, Baroness Thatcher's biographer Charles Moore wrote: ""Because the coup was unjustified, and so trust broke down, the politics of the next 15 years were those of civil war."""
2015-05-07,Election swings and roundabouts,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-32741924,"If election manifesto claims are all about smoke and mirrors, should we now add swings and roundabouts to the political metaphor?There's an intriguing aspect to the general election results in the Midlands that puzzled me.It's the striking contrast in the swings between Labour and the Conservatives.David Cameron and his campaign strategists knew they were home and dry when Nuneaton was the first Midlands marginal to declare.It was not only a Tory hold but a swing to the Conservatives from Labour of 3%.I was in the Nottingham suburb of Beeston awaiting the result of the Broxtowe count. Would its high profile Conservative MP Anna Soubry survive a red surge?Nuneaton set the pattern. Across the Midlands, both east and west, there was a uniform swing of between three and four per cent to the Tories - Warwickshire North 3%, Amber Valley 4%, Derbyshire South 4% and Sherwood 4%. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan topped the Tory swingometer in the Midlands marginals with 5% in Loughborough.Yet in the big cities, it was a very different story. The swing went to Labour.So in Nottingham East they enjoyed a 6% swing, Nottingham South 5.8%, Leicester South 7.3%, Leicester West 5%, Birmingham Hall Green 12%, Birmingham Hodge Hill 8%.If swings to Labour on this scale had gone beyond the city ring road roundabouts and into the suburbs, Ed Miliband would have become prime minister by now.In confidence, one senior Labour insider in Nottingham told me its success in the city wards was down to organisation, experience and its teams of activists.""We won the ground war. If Nottingham's city boundaries were extended into Sherwood and Broxtowe, we would have won those constituencies as well,"" he told me.Labour leadership candidate, Leicester West's Liz Kendall has identified her party's problem beyond the ring road roundabout.It's about reaching out to Middle England.""We need to show people that we understand their aspirations and ambitions for the future,"" she told the Sunday Times.The problem for Labour was that Middle England was not interested in what the party offered…and still isn't. The Cameron brand worked its magic in those Midlands marginals... it'll take something or someone special to break up that ballot box relationship."
2015-05-07,Royal 'lobbying',https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32740154,"Prince Charles sent 27 letters to then Prime Minister Tony Blair and members of his government between September 2004 and March 2005, ""despite the Freedom of Information Act!"" as the prince joked in one.But did his suggestions and concerns have any bearing on the behaviour of Mr Blair's government?The request: Prince Charles expresses his worries over an EU directive on complementary medicines ""which is… effectively outlawing the use of certain herbal extracts"".  Mr Blair replied, offering moral support and practical help. He agreed that ""the implementation as it is currently planned is crazy"" and set out an action plan that included delaying implementation for all existing products to 2011. What happened: Herbal products were not required to be authorised until 2011, just as Mr Blair had promised. Prince Charles continues to sell his own brand of complementary products, Duchy Herbals, through Boots and Waitrose. The request: Writing to Mr Blair, the prince expresses a ""growing sense of anxiety"" that the Hill Farming Allowance, which supports farmers working on Britain's uplands, could be scrapped. In his reply, the prime minister said he understood that the Hill Farm Allowance would continue until 2007. What happened: The allowance lasted until the end of Labour's tenure in 2010, when it was abolished.The request: Just 18 months after the US-led invasion of Iraq, Prince Charles raised the issue of poor performance of Lynx helicopters in high temperatures, saying: ""I fear that this is just one more example of where our Armed Forces are being asked to do an extremely challenging job (particularly in Iraq) without the necessary resources.""Mr Blair replied: ""On the subject of the Lynx helicopter, the limitations of the existing platform, particularly in the extremely challenging environment within Iraq, are well recognised by the Ministry of Defence."" He added that replacement of the helicopters would be a priority. What happened: Mr Blair's comments go much further than what he was saying about the subject at the time. In the event, though, the fleet was not fully upgraded until 2011.The request: Prince Charles lamented that the government's TB prevention plans might not ""include a commitment to deal with the badger problem in the immediate future"" and pushed strongly for a cull, saying: ""All I can say is that I do urge you to look again at introducing a proper cull of badgers where it is necessary.""Mr Blair sympathised, saying he could ""personally see the case for culling badgers"". However, he was unwilling to commit to a cull.  What happened: Culling trials were conducted from 1998-2005. The final results, published in 2008, said that the badger cull could ""make no meaningful contribution"" to curbing bovine TB. It wasn't until 2013 that a full culling programme began in two pilot areas. These ended with the conclusion that the pilots had been neither humane nor effective at curbing the spread of TB.The request: Then Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell wrote to Prince Charles to say she had decided to give parts of the historic Smithfield meat market Grade II listed status, and was trying to persuade deputy prime minister John Prescott to ""call in"" the planning application to prevent demolition of other parts of the site. She had been swayed by evidence provided by Sir Neil Cossons, who was English Heritage chair at the time, after he had been asked by the prince to add his support. Prince Charles replied that he was ""extremely glad to read of your appreciation of the value of this group of buildings"". According to the Guardian, market workers desperate to see the redevelopment of the site invited the prince to meet them to discuss it, but his office said he was ""unlikely to accept as he did not want to interfere in the planning process"".What happened: Smithfield market is still the subject of planning battles a decade on. Successive planning applications have been refused by ministers. Last year then Communities Secretary Eric Pickles rejected plans for an office development on the site, stating that ""the extent of damage that the application would cause to the important heritage assets at Smithfield runs entirely counter to national and policy objectives intended to protect such assets from harm"".In March, the Museum of London announced a move from its current Barbican site to the Smithfield market building."
2015-05-07,Election fallout,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32703139,"""Some of those gimmicks - that tombstone, whatever idiot thought that up I do not know!""I was talking to the former Mayor of Crawley in Sussex, John Mortimer, in the town's Labour Supporters Club about the vexed question of what went wrong, and where Labour should go next. This seat is one of those southern seats Labour hoped to take, but failed.I hear a whole range of views in the club.""They didn't give nothing to depend on, they should be clear, and a little bit more down to Earth."" ""Good party, wrong leader, they don't look after business enough.""Councillor John Stanley tells me: ""I think in a way we did go too left, but now we can go a bit centre-left, or centre, depending who the new leader is.""The former mayor sums up the mood on the doorstep: ""Whatever we told them, they didn't believe us.""  Expect to hear all those views, and more, in the coming leadership contest. Step back from the angst of supporters, and it may not be that hard to see why Labour failed.  An economic recovery, hailed by independent organisations as the result of government policy, undid a party that had loudly proclaimed for five years that the coalition's policies would lead to economic disaster. Combine that with an uncharismatic and uninspirational leader, then you might argue no further debate is necessary.Fat chance of that. Defeat breeds resentment, and this one has opened up old divisions.  A chorus of Blairties, led by the man himself, has declared that Ed's problem was ignoring those with aspiration and ambition, failing to appeal to those running business. Incidentally, I've been ticked off by the perspicacious editor of the New Statesman, Jason Cowley, for using the ""unhelpful"" term ""Blairites"".I can't think of another description that fits Tony, Lord Mandelson, Lord Adonis and David Miliband quite so well. But call them what you will, the message was clear - Ed was too left wing, Labour should move back to the centre, or, if you like, to the right.Reading Mr Blair's pithy analysis, listening to Lord Mandelson's gripping and savage eloquence, describing a party sent out to shout: ""We love the poor and hate the rich,"" and so ignoring the middle, and you realise strong emotions are in play.But back to the future may not be sufficient. Of course elections are won on the centre ground. But grandees grinding axes, affronted by the failure of boys who used to make their tea, may be creating so much noise that they can't hear more insistent sounds.  For there are several elephants trumpeting loudly as they cram into the small space of the shadow cabinet room. Imagine these beasts are as gaily decorated as Berlin buddy bears. One is decked out in red, another in imperial purple bunting, and another, a mammoth, strong tusked and ice rimmed, painted yellow with tartan trimmings.Take the last first. The Scottish wipeout is Labour's biggest problem. Fail to solve it, and Labour can forget ever having a comfortable majority again. It is hard to argue Labour were wiped out in Scotland because the SNP outflanked them to the right with their appeal to the business community and the ambitious and aspirational. But it is true the SNP drew in to people from left, right and centre, just as the modernisers say Labour should. It was the politics of economic self-interest, but cast in a very different light. Tribally sneering at ""the reactionary ideology of nationalism"" as Mr Blair does, will not reach the central belt of Scotland, the middle ground of  Midlothian.What about that purple pachyderm?  In Crawley - in fact in seat after seat - there is a similar pattern.  Labour did, in fact, often increase the size of their vote. So did the Conservatives, usually by a bit more. But the real dynamic was the total collapse of the Lib Dems and the dramatic rise of UKIP. The increase in votes for Nigel Farage's party wasn't translated into parliamentary seats, but, although it is early days in terms of research, it probably hurt Labour a lot. If we believe - and I do - Matthew Goodwin and Rob Ford, authors of Revolt on the Right, these voters are often former Labour supporters - older, less educated, those left behind on the tides of  globalisation, stranded on the shores of post-industrialisation. They may have had too many disappointments to feel much ambition or aspiration. They are a challenge for Labour, and any new leader will spend a good deal of time thinking how to deal with the concerns of Europe and immigration.Whether to share their fears, or confront them will be a big decision.Which brings us to Red Nellie. Those members who still proudly call themselves socialist. This is not about Old Labour - they are more likely to be baristas or barristers than boilermakers. It is easy as an outsider, as a journalist, to treat politics as an intellectual game about how best to win power - but many people, particularly the foot soldiers, particularly after the death of  purely tribal loyalties, are in it because they passionately believe in winning  power to do something specific.Many of them are suspicious of the later incarnations of New Labour, not because it reached an accommodation with wealth and business, but because it seemed to worship at the same altar, to regard the party's core beliefs in redistribution and equality as childish fantasies from a past age.Perhaps to Mr Blair, they are the problem, people who may equate ""ambition"" with greed. They might point out that a man who claims to be worth ""only"" £20m may find it harder than most to squeeze through the eye of a needle to understand their point of view. Most successful Labour leaders will confront the left at some point, but the concerns of this group go to the existential question ""What is the party for?""This is not a polemic - not an argument about what should be done, but a reflection on the complex conundrums that will face any new Labour leader, the tearing apart of the old alliance that made up a Labour majority, and so the political need to satisfy groups with very different, indeed, contradictory demands. But looking for a Social Democratic universal theory of everything may be missing the point. What the party desperately wants is a leader who can pull the disparate threads together and articulate them as common purpose. Whether she or he exists is another matter.Much more on that in the coming months."
2015-05-07,'Take us with you',https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-32736153,"Thousands of people in the north of England have been using the hashtag ""take us with you Scotland"" to express their upset about the result of last week's general election, and Scottish nationalists are welcoming this English minority with open arms. Last Thursday's general election was a rough one for the Labour Party in its traditional stronghold in the north of England. But further to the north, the left-leaning Scottish National Party won nearly every seat it contested. That political contrast has made some left-wing voters in places like Manchester, Leeds and Sheffield look fondly on their neighbours. Since last Thursday's election in Britain the phrase ""take us with you Scotland"" has been used more than 24,000 times. ""Genuinely beginning to wonder if the North of England becoming a part of Scotland would be better for us, I really am,"" tweeted Aaron Miller from Yorkshire. Some cracked jokes under the tag after the North West Motorway Police account, which gives traffic updates, announced that they had ""picked up a pedestrian on the M62 who was trying to walk to Scotland.""After an initial spike of jokes over the weekend, the hashtag really took off when users start to mobilise in support of around a year-old petition on the campaigning site Change.org. The petition calls for the north of England to secede from the rest of the country and join up with Scotland, and more than 12,000 people have signed it.Its creator, a Sheffield resident who calls himself ""Stu Dent"", set it up to coincide with last year's Scottish independence referendum, and he also created a map imagining the boundary of a ""Scotland plus the north"" country.Stu Dent runs the Twitter account Hunters Bar, named after an area of southwest Sheffield which is very popular with - you guessed it - students. Despite the account having thousands of followers on Twitter, when the map was first posted last year, the image was shared only about 100 times - however, in the past week it's been retweeted by thousands. Stu Dent told BBC Trending that he was surprised at how popular his idea has become. ""In hindsight, perhaps I shouldn't have been,"" he said. ""There is a huge frustration in parts of the UK about the things that have happened since 2010.""""I think people need a place to go where they can say 'not in my name! This is not the England I want',"" he added. But in addition to disappointment from some quarters about the election result, there might be another reason why the petition is getting a boost now: the power of the Scottish Nationalists on Twitter. What started as a post-election joke in the North of England was quickly embraced by the so-called ""Cyber Nats"" - and a trend was born.The SNP's social media strategist Ross Colquhoun expressed the party's mood about the hashtag best, in a post which was shared more than 500 times. ""2014: #LetsStayTogether 2015: #TakeUsWithYouScotland What a difference a year makes"" he tweeted.Blog by Hannah HendersonNext story: The sport reporter and the obscene ranter who lost his jobFollow BBC Trending on Twitter @BBCtrending, and find us on Facebook."
2015-05-07,What Britain wants from Europe,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32695399,"David Cameron says he has a mandate to pursue EU reform following the Conservatives' general election victory. The PM, who will be hoping his majority government will give him extra leverage in Brussels, wants to renegotiate the terms of the UK's membership ahead of a referendum by the end of 2017. He has said he will campaign for Britain to remain in the EU if he gets the reforms he wants.Mr Cameron has said he does not want to reveal full details of his negotiating hand but he has given a broad indication, in a series of speeches and newspaper articles, of his priorities when he goes into talks with other EU leaders.These are: The prime minister has said Britain would resist any move towards a European Army and that he wants to free British police forces from EU interference. He has also ruled out Britain joining the euro.But he has placed less emphasis in recent years on demanding changes to EU social policy, such as the maximum 48-hour working week, agency workers, maternity leave and non-discrimination rules.The official UK government position is that a referendum will be held by the end of 2017 but Downing Street sources have said: ""If we can do it earlier we will.""There is speculation David Cameron is planning to hold the vote in 2016 to avoid a clash with French and German elections in 2017.The prime minister wants treaty change but even if the referendum was held in 2017 there may not be enough time to legally incorporate any reforms into a treaty and it would have to be done at a later stage.An early referendum would anger Eurosceptics who believe it would not allow enough time to make the case for exit or negotiate any meaningful concessions.""A rushed process would severely undermine the chances to secure a significant deal that both British business and voters could support and would waste the opportunity of a lifetime,"" Matthew Elliott, chief executive of Business for Britain told Breitbart London.The question is always crucial in any referendum and there is already a debate about what it should be. The Draft European Union (Referendum) Bill, published by the Conservatives in 2013, proposed this form of words: ""Do you think that the United Kingdom should remain a member of the European Union?""Some thought that leaned too far towards the status quo, encouraging a yes vote, and the Electoral Commission said it was not clear and direct enough. The watchdog proposed this form of words instead: ""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union?""The new Conservative government will attempt to repeal the Human Rights Act, which requires UK courts to treat the European Court of Human Rights as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. The European Court of Human Rights is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe (CoE), which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine.The freedom for people to move around Europe, enshrined in the EU treaties, works in parallel with the other three basic freedoms in the single market: freedom of goods, capital and services.It is likely to be a ""red line"" for other EU leaders, who do not want to see it eroded.Mr Cameron has steered clear of tackling it directly - for example by asking for an emergency ""brake"" on free movement, or a cap on numbers - focusing instead on reducing the incentive provided by welfare payments. In a speech last November, David Cameron set out measures to reduce the number of EU nationals moving to the UK.His main proposals were:Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission, has said he is ready to work with Mr Cameron to ""strike a fair deal for the United Kingdom in the EU"". The leaders of other EU nations have previously warned they are unlikely to support major changes to EU treaties to accommodate British demands. But Mr Cameron's general election victory may have given him extra leverage. ""The ball is very much in the court of the UK now,"" a senior EU official told The Guardian. ""It's up to the British to define what they want."" The key figure will be German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is very keen to keep Britain in the EU but has so far been unwilling to make major concessions to enable that to happen. There are fears that a ""pick and mix"" approach to EU treaties would undermine EU cohesion.Mr Cameron has said there is ""no doubt"" his planned reforms will require changes to the treaties governing the European Union. But this would require the unanimous support of all EU members, and may not be possible within the deadline he has set of a referendum before the end of 2017. Any attempt to change EU laws on free movement would meet fierce resistance from some EU nations, particularly Eastern European states. Mr Juncker has said free movement is non-negotiable.Mr Cameron may find it difficult to get unanimous support for his proposals for a four-year waiting period for migrant workers claiming UK benefits. East European EU members would be likely to oppose this, on the grounds that it would discriminate against their citizens.  Attempts to secure opt-outs for the City are unlikely to go down well with other European leaders.However, there are precedents for EU treaty changes to accommodate some countries' specific concerns - for example, the protocol attached to the Lisbon Treaty for Ireland.Mr Cameron has faced repeated calls to say whether he would campaign for Britain's exit from the EU in the referendum if he fails to get what he wants from the renegotiation process. All he has said is that he will ""rule nothing out"". Some Conservative MPs want Britain to leave the EU no matter what David Cameron manages to renegotiate. A larger group are likely to want more concessions than Mr Cameron has so far indicated he is prepared to demand.Senior backbencher David Davis, who was defeated by Mr Cameron for the Tory leadership in 2005, told the Daily Telegraph the majority of the 332 Conservative MPs want Mr Cameron to negotiate an ""opt-out"" power to stop individual EU laws from applying to Britain. The prime minister has said this would be ""impossible"" without Britain leaving the EU.Mr Davis claims as many as 60 Tory MPs would be prepared to rebel and vote for Britain's exit from the EU if the prime minister fails to deliver.Graham Brady, chairman of the Tory backbench 1922 committee, which represents backbenchers, has urged David Cameron to give all Conservative MPs, including ministers, a free vote in the EU referendum.In January, Mr Cameron warned that serving cabinet ministers would have to quit the government if they wanted to campaign to leave the EU if he had secured the reforms to it he wants.In the 1975 referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Economic Community, as the EU was then called, Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson decided to suspend collective responsibility because his cabinet was split on the issue. Ministers were allowed to vote with their consciences and campaign against each other. The majority of them, including Mr Wilson, joined the Yes camp, but left-wingers, such as Tony Benn, played a leading role in the No campaign. The Yes campaign won easily with 67% of the vote."

2015-05-08,Scots Labour leader Murphy to resign,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32760196,"Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy is to resign next month, he has announced.It comes despite Mr Murphy narrowly surviving a vote of no confidence at a meeting of the party's national executive in Glasgow. Mr Murphy said he would tender his resignation alongside a plan to reform the party.He lost his seat in last week's general election as the SNP won 56 of the 59 Scottish seats, leaving Labour with a single MP in Scotland.Mr Murphy said he wanted to have a successor as leader in place by the summer, and confirmed he would not be standing for a seat at the Scottish Parliament in next year's election. Instead, he said it was time to ""do something else"" and that he believed the party would continue to be divided if he remained as leader. His deputy, Kezia Dugdale MSP, will become acting leader until a permanent successor is found. Mr Murphy had faced calls to resign from several MSPs, trade unions and former MPs in the wake of his party's near wipeout at the general election.He insisted he had decided to stand down ahead of the national executive voting by 17-14 in favour of him staying in the job.Speaking at a media conference after the national executive meeting, he said: ""It is clear that a small minority who didn't accept my election as leader of the Scottish Labour Party just five months ago won't accept the vote of the executive today and that will continue to divide the party.""Today I received more support in the executive vote than I did from members of the executive when I stood for election five months ago.""He said it would be up to the executive whether to accept the reforms he would be proposing before he left the post. But he warned: ""A party in such urgent need of reform blocks those changes at its peril.""The former East Renfrewshire MP said Labour had been crushed between ""two nationalisms"" in Scotland and England.Mr Murphy said he left no legacy of bitterness for anyone in the Labour Party, and the only person he was angry at was the person who blamed Scottish Labour for the party's UK-wide general election defeat - a reference to Unite leader Len McCluskey.And he said that in many ways Scottish Labour was the ""least modernised part of the Labour movement"" and that he wanted his successor to be elected under a one member, one vote system.Mr Murphy added: ""The Labour Party's problem is not the link with trade unions, or even the relationship with Unite members - far from it. It is the destructive behaviour of one high profile trade unionist.""The leader of the Scottish Labour Party doesn't serve at the grace of Len McCluskey, and the next leader of the UK Labour Party should not be picked by Len McCluskey.""Mr McCluskey has been a vocal critic of Mr Murphy's leadership and opposed his appointment in December when Mr Murphy won the contest to replace Johann Lamont.Jim Murphy laughed and joked with Scottish Labour's sole MP as he made his way down the hotel corridor to announce his resignation.He certainly brought energy and dynamism to his election campaign - but all that achieved was Ian Murray in Edinburgh South.So as Mr Murphy bows out, who could replace him?The deputy leader Kezia Dugdale may want to step up or Neil Findlay could try again after challenging last time. Maybe the party's finance spokeswoman Jackie Baillie thinks her steady hand could steer the ship.Jenny Marra is also often talked about as future face of the party.Whoever steps into Jim Murphy's red shoes he or she will have to face a difficult 2016 Holyrood election, to put it mildly.There are also more fundamental questions about how the party can possibly move on as it faces a surging SNP.Mr Murphy was very much a creature of ""New Labour"" - but to today's generation that's old Labour.Party members may start looking for someone with no links to the past, neither a Brownite nor a Blairite. A 'cleanskin' - as the politicos put it - may well help re-connect with voters.That's a long way from now though - even some of the party's opponents may view this latest train wreck with a modicum of sympathy. Ms Lamont had resigned after claiming Scottish Labour was treated like a ""branch office"" by the London-based party leadership.Mr Murphy concluded his speech by saying: ""Scotland needs a strong Labour party; Scotland needs a united Labour party. We have been the greatest force for change in our nation's remarkable history. ""The Scottish Labour party will rise again. It will be under someone else's leadership and I am confident about my party's future.""Harriet Harman MP, acting leader of the UK Labour Party, said it would be for Scottish Labour to choose a new leader. She added: ""As a cabinet minister and leader of his party in Scotland, Jim has been a hugely important figure in the Labour Party. He leaves with the best wishes and thanks of our movement.""Labour peer Lord McConnell, a former Scottish first minister, said the party's problems were ""much deeper than one individual and one affiliate"".He said: ""We have a disconnect locally and nationally with wider Scottish society. ""We have a problem with our political positioning in the post devolution age where the party particularly at the UK level has never been comfortable with success in the Scottish parliament and has always tried to see things through a UK prism rather than a Scottish prism.""We need to find a new generation, a new leader, new generation, new ideas, a fresh approach.""In a tweet, Scottish first minister and SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said: ""I wish Jim Murphy all the very best for the future. Leadership is not easy and he deserves credit for standing up for what he believes in.""Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson also reacted on Twitter, saying: ""Jim Murphy announces a managed exit in order to help the party, which is to his credit. But leaves a tough gig for whoever comes next.""The meeting of Scottish Labour's executive was disrupted by protesters who entered the party's headquarters.Police were called and the protesters, who included persistent anti-austerity activists Sean Clerkin and Piers Doughty-Brown, left the building to protest further from the street outside.The protesters were calling for Mr Murphy to remain as leader to ""finish the job of destroying Scottish Labour"".A Police Scotland spokeswoman said officers had been called and found two protestors on the third floor of the building. She added: ""Both left on police arrival. Advice and assistance was given."""
2015-05-08,Labour contenders clash on spending,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32761561,"Prospective Labour leaders have clashed over Labour's record in government in their first public debate in the race to succeed Ed Miliband.Former cabinet ministers including Yvette Cooper and Andy Burnham defended Labour's fiscal record and spending on schools and hospitals.However, candidates from the 2010 intake of MPs argued that the party spent too much while in office.The debate followed Chuka Umunna's withdrawal from the leadership contest.The remaining candidates appeared at the annual conference of the Progress think tank in London.There was agreement that Labour needed to demonstrate economic credibility to regain power, with shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt telling the meeting that the party needed to be ""trusted with public finances and the family finances"".Mr Hunt, who was first elected to Parliament in 2010 when Labour lost power, argued the last Labour government ""spent too much"" and failed to ""leave enough economic headroom to deal with the economic crisis and the recession"".Shadow health minister Liz Kendall said: ""There's absolutely nothing progressive about spending more on debt interest payments than on educating our children.""But shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: ""The Tories have had a triumph of spin over the facts in saying what they said about the economic record of the last Labour government.""The former chief secretary to the Treasury said the deficit did ""grow too large"" in the government's later years but insisted: ""The last Labour government ran more surpluses in its first term than the Tories did in 18 years.""Yvette Cooper, another former chief secretary to the Treasury, said: ""We should never let anybody tell us that it was too many teachers, doctors or nurses that caused Lehman Brothers bank in New York to crash.""Shadow international development secretary Mary Creagh said: ""People have forgotten the economic credibility that the last Labour government had.""She said Labour had built schools and hospitals that were ""treasured in our communities"".Ms Cooper, Mr Burnham, Ms Kendall and Ms Creagh have declared their intention to run for leader, while Mr Hunt told the conference he would make an announcement next week.At the same event, shadow energy secretary Caroline Flint announced she would be running for deputy leader.The Don Valley MP told the Today programme ahead of the debate that Labour lost the election because ""fundamentally the public did not trust us on the economy"".Exeter MP Ben Bradshaw has already announced a bid to be deputy, saying Labour ""must and could win the next election"", but only if it ""broadens its appeal by adopting sensible, centre-left politics which celebrate wealth creation and entrepreneurship"".Former Labour campaign co-ordinator Tom Watson is reported to be crowd-funding a deputy leadership bid, while Walthamstow MP Stella Creasy has said she is ""open to the question"" of running.Barnsley East MP and shadow transport secretary Michael Dugher - a fierce critic of Ed Miliband's election campaign - is to run Mr Burnham's campaign, according to the website LabourList.It is reported that Mr Burnham also has the backing of Labour peer Lord Falconer, who was lord chancellor and justice secretary under Tony Blair and was close to the former PM.Shadow culture secretary Chris Bryant has signalled his backing for Ms Cooper, tweeting that the next leader must be ""someone who's been tried in the fiery furnace of public opinion"".Mr Hunt said on Friday he would be be attending the debate - along with the other four hopefuls - to ""set out my analysis on how we begin to understand what went so wrong and why"".He added: ""We must use this leadership election to ask some very profound questions.""All voices in the party must be heard so that we can have a full and proper assessment as to why the politics of nationalism triumphed in Scotland and huge swathes of England, and how we have allowed the Conservative Party to present a more compelling vision for Britain to so many millions of people.""Speculation still surrounds shadow business secretary Mr Umunna's decision to pull out on Friday, when he said he was not ""comfortable"" with the ""pressure"" of being a candidate.As well as citing extensive pressure and scrutiny Mr Umunna also said he was ruling himself out because of concerns about the impact of the bid on his family.A rising star of the party, Mr Umunna was first elected to Parliament in 2010 - alongside Tristram Hunt and Liz Kendall - before joining the shadow cabinet.Asked about the candidate who might win, Conservative Chancellor George Osborne said: ""The Labour leadership contest has descended into farce.""But it's not actually about personalities. I don't think the Labour Party any more represents the working people of this country who aspire to a better life."""

I'm not suggesting he takes a break from being leader.""Clearly the national executive has the authority, they're the ruling body. ""I'm told that they made a decision. I'm told it was a procedurally correct decision, he is the leader but I think it's important that as leader he takes a break and I think it's important that we work out how these complex questions are answered by a team.""No one person has all the answers. I'm particularly concerned about tone, making sure we get a tone that ensures that the 27 million people who didn't vote for UKIP last week may be persuaded to vote for us in future.""The party has been beset by wrangling since Mr Farage agreed to stay on as leader, days after standing down after failing to get elected in Thanet South.He had pledged before the general election that he would quit the post if he failed to get elected to Parliament.Senior aide Matthew Richardson has left the party, following claims from MEP Patrick O'Flynn that Mr Farage had fallen under the influence of ""inexperienced"" advisers.UKIP has also confirmed the departure of Mr Farage's chief of staff Raheem Kassam.Mr Farage ruled out quitting as leader on BBC's Question Time on Thursday, saying he had ""phenomenal"" support, and has challenged his critics to decide whether they want to stay in the party.In his article, Mr Carswell had said that ""knowing how difficult it is to lead a party makes me admire Nigel Farage all the more"".""I know that I never could,"" he added, stressing that he would find it ""impossible to simultaneously lead UKIP, be the voice of the party in the Commons, represent my Clacton constituents and at the same time be a husband and a dad"".However, he said that ""even leaders need to take a break"", adding: ""Nigel needs to take a break now.""UKIP got nearly four million votes at the election, but returned only one MP - former Conservative Mr Carswell in the Clacton constituency."

Under the plans, ministers could force schools rated as ""requiring improvement"" and missing new government benchmarks to become an academy.Coasting schools have average results which have often flatlined over time.Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, Mrs Morgan said faster action was needed.She said: ""Our big priorities will be to speed up the process for tackling failing schools; extend our academies programme to tackle 'coasting' schools; and deliver on our commitment to open new free schools.""The proposals will be in a new bill due to be introduced in the Queen's Speech. ""First, we will take new powers to step in from the moment that a school is found to be failing,"" Mrs Morgan said.""From day one, regional schools commissioners will be able to bring in new leadership and support from other excellent schools and heads, and we will speed up the process of turning schools into academies to make sure that new expert leadership is found for all schools that need it as quickly as possible.""She said that coasting schools will be put on an immediate notice to improve and could then be taken over and turned into an academy.They will be required to work with a team of ""expert"" head teachers.She said: ""Those that aren't able to demonstrate a clear plan for improvement will be given new leadership - we know this works in turning schools around.""More than 3,300 schools in England are labelled ""requires improvement"", but the plans are unlikely to cover that many schools.Under the current system, secondary schools are considered to be failing, and therefore eligible for intervention, if fewer than 40% of their students score at least five Cs at GCSE, including English and maths, and they do not meet national averages in pupil progress.In primary schools, the threshold for intervention is if fewer than 65% of pupils get Level 4 in reading, writing and maths and a below average number of pupils make the expected amount of progress.It is not yet clear how coasting schools will be deemed in need of intervention.It is understood that a new category will be devised covering schools which are rated as ""requires improvement"" and which fail to meet a new set of standards on improvement."
2015-05-08,Co-op Group to keep political funding,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-32762858,"The Co-operative Group has decided to continue financially supporting the Co-operative Party, which has strong ties to Labour.Members of the group, the UK's biggest mutual organisation, voted on the issue at their annual general meeting.They passed a motion by 48,579 for, to 39,479 against, to approve ""political expenditures"" of up to £1m which support the movement's objectives.Last year the Co-op Group gave £625,000 to the Co-op Party.This figure was down on the sums donated in previous years. The AGM also included a vote on new corporate governance procedures which would mean members having less of a direct say.The Co-operative Group is still recovering from a period of financial mismanagement and some members have recently expressed concerns about how elections to the board are chosen.The banking arm of the group came close to collapse in 2013, bringing the whole group to a £2.5bn annual loss that year. The Co-op Party includes among its members a number of Labour MPs, including shadow chancellor Chris Leslie and Walthamstow MP Stella Creasy. The politicians stand as candidates of both the Co-operative Party and the Labour Party, and the two political movements have strong historical ties. The board asked the members of the Co-operative Group whether they wanted to continue financially supporting the Co-operative Party, or any other party. Allan Leighton, chairman of the Co-op Group, said: ""There's a clear remit from the members to continue to support the Labour Party.""It allows us to now have a conversation with the Co-op Labour Party about what we do next.""There was also a members' motion on the agenda, put forward by those in favour of making political donations of up to £1m a year.The motion to approve political funding ""not to exceed £1m per annum"" was carried by 55.17% to 44.83%.BBC business correspondent Joe Lynam said: ""To meet a £1.5bn hole in its accounts - mostly stemming from its banking division - the Co-op Group has had to sell off parts of its businesses and hand over majority control of its bank to American hedge funds.""It's also in the process of radically changing the way it runs itself into a more corporate structure with less of a direct say by its members.""He said that ""in theory"", each of the 2.8 million Co-op members could vote on a series of motions about the reforms, as well as how its bosses are paid, and retaining the links to the Co-operative party.One of the group's largest independent societies, Midcounties, recently threatened legal action over a shortlist of six candidates for the group's board being reduced to three - the number of positions available - before a member vote.

2015-05-08,Osborne plans July 'stability' Budget,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32761566,"Chancellor George Osborne has said that he will deliver a new Budget on 8 July.He claimed it would have ""a laser-like focus"" on raising productivity and living standards.He said he was making the unusual move of having a second Budget in one year in order to ""deliver on the commitments we have made to working people"".Labour said the chancellor would have to set out ""who is going to pay"" for what it called ""uncosted promises"" in the election campaign.Speaking outside 11 Downing Street, the chancellor gave a broad outline of his plans for the forthcoming Budget but refused to be drawn on the details, including the Conservatives' planned £12bn of welfare cuts.""I don't want to wait to deliver on the commitments we have made to working people,"" he said.""It will continue with the balanced plan we have to deal with our debts, invest in our health service and reform welfare to make work pay.""But there will also be a laser-like focus on making our economy more productive so we raise living standards across our country.""We're going to put Britain into good shape for the long term.""The last Budget was held on 18 March and included tax cuts for first-time house buyers.Writing in the Sun, Mr Osborne admitted it was ""unusual"" to have two Budgets in the same year, but he wanted to turn ""promises made in the election into a reality"".Again, Mr Osborne did not specifically outline how the Conservatives plan to fulfil a pledge to cut £12bn in welfare spending but said he wants to make the welfare system ""fair for the people who pay for it"".He writes: ""We will protect the NHS and give it more funding each and every year, while making savings across Whitehall. ""We'll crack down hard on tax avoidance and aggressive tax planning by the rich - because everyone should pay their fair share.  ""We will always protect the most vulnerable, but we also need a welfare system that's fair to the people who pay for it. If you can work you should be working, so we'll take the next steps in our benefit reforms to make sure that happens.""Second, we've got to go on helping businesses create jobs in Britain, so we move towards full employment. That means facing a hard truth: in Britain we produce about a quarter less for every hour we work than countries like America or Germany. Fixing that long-running productivity weakness is the big challenge for the next five years.""So in the Budget we'll spend less on welfare, and instead invest to create three million more apprenticeships, so that young people can learn a trade, get better jobs and earn more.""After the Budget in March independent forecaster the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said that Mr Osborne needed to spell out exactly how he plans to cut £12bn from welfare spending.Of those £12bn planned cuts, £2bn were outlined ahead of the general election - all the cuts are supposed to be in place by 2017-18.Labour's shadow energy and climate change secretary, Caroline Flint, accused the Tories of making ""a number of uncosted promises"" during the election campaign.She told the BBC: ""It will be interesting to see who is going to pay for those uncosted policies when they bring the Budget in July."""
2015-05-08,Farage should take a break - Carswell,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32761766,"UKIP leader Nigel Farage ""needs to take a break now"", the party's only MP Douglas Carswell has said.Writing in the Times, Mr Carswell said he admired Mr Farage, but questioned his ""ill-advised"" comments about HIV patients, made in a TV leaders' debate.Mr Farage ruled out quitting as leader on BBC's Question Time on Thursday, saying he had ""phenomenal"" support.It follows a bitter internal row within the party, which has seen two of Mr Farage's senior aides resigning.In his article, Mr Carswell said that ""knowing how difficult it is to lead a party makes me admire Nigel Farage all the more"".""I know that I never could,"" he added, stressing that he would find it ""impossible to simultaneously lead UKIP, be the voice of the party in the Commons, represent my Clacton constituents and at the same time be a husband and a dad"".However, he said that ""even leaders need to take a break"", adding: ""Nigel needs to take a break now.""He described Mr Farage as ""inspirational"", saying the party had ""done extraordinarily well"" under his leadership but now needed to ""consider carefully what comes next"".Earlier, Mr Farage challenged his critics to decide whether they wanted him to stay in the party.He said he had ""massive"" support from UKIP MEPs, donors and party members to continue in the role, suggesting one person, whom he did not name, was ""agitating for change"".Addressing the prospect of a future EU referendum, Mr Carswell said: ""All of us UKIP supporters should ask one question; Is what I'm doing at this moment making an 'out' vote more likely? If it isn't, stop it and do something else.""He also criticised Mr Farage's comments about HIV patients during the TV leaders' debate last month.While debating about the NHS, Mr Farage said: ""You can come into Britain from anywhere in the world and get diagnosed with HIV and get the retro-viral drugs that cost up to £25,000 per year per patient.""Mr Carswell wrote: ""By all means we should highlight the problem of health tourism. But we need to admit that using the example of HIV patients to make the point was ill-advised.""He said the party needed to strike ""the right tone"" and added: ""UKIP has been at its most persuasive when we have been most optimistic.""Anger is never a great way to motivate people - at least not for very long.""The party has been beset by wrangling since Mr Farage agreed to stay on as leader, days after standing down after failing to get elected in Thanet South.He had pledged before the general election that he would quit the post if he failed to get elected to Parliament.Matthew Richardson has left the party, following claims from MEP Patrick O'Flynn that Mr Farage had fallen under the influence of ""inexperienced"" advisers. UKIP has also confirmed the departure of Mr Farage's chief of staff Raheem Kassam.UKIP got nearly four million votes at the election, but returned only one MP - former Conservative Mr Carswell in the Clacton constituency."

They absolutely loved how he helped them and he was a highly-regarded local MP,"" Mr Bone said.""He stood up for what was right rather than what the party line was. In those days - the John Major years - it was much more difficult to stand up against the party machine. He had strong views on Europe.""Sir Peter started his career as an insurance broker, joining the Wycombe Young Conservatives in 1949 and the Oxford University Conservative Association in 1951.He went on to become a Conservative councillor on Buckinghamshire County Council between 1961 and 1967.Wellingborough mayor-elect Barry Graves also paid tribute to Sir Peter, remembering him as a ""very strong constituency MP"".""I remember going out and canvassing with him and he would go everywhere. He knew the area and the people. He was very much a man of the local constituency.""He was ""a very approachable man"", Mr Graves added.Sir Peter was knighted in 1994. "

2015-05-08,PM will 'look at' powers proposals,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32746049,"David Cameron has said he would ""look at"" any proposals for further powers for Scotland but wants to get the Smith Commission plans implemented first.The prime minister was speaking after meeting Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon in Edinburgh.Mr Cameron said he made a ""commitment"" to include a devolution bill in the Queen's Speech later this month.Ms Sturgeon argued the Smith Commission proposals were ""a good starting point"" but did not go far enough.The prime minister has pledged to include a bill on devolution in this month's Queen's Speech which would be based on the cross-party Smith Commission agreement. The Smith proposals included giving Holyrood the power to set income tax rates and bands, as well as control over a share of VAT and some welfare benefits. But Ms Sturgeon's SNP also wants the Scottish Parliament to be given powers over business taxes, employment law, the minimum wage and additional powers over welfare.Speaking after meeting Ms Sturgeon, Mr Cameron told the BBC: ""Let's make sure Smith is implemented in full. I'm going to keep the commitment I made to the people of Scotland. Let's get that done first because it does create a really strong Scottish Parliament.""He added: ""Of course, if people want to make future proposals I'll look at them.""The prime minister again said he did not support full fiscal autonomy for Scotland - the responsibility for all areas of tax and spending except defence and foreign affairs - stating that it would mean £7bn of cuts or extra tax-raising.What Nicola Sturgeon is trying to say is she has a mandate. She has 56 out of the 59 MPs elected in Scotland and she won 50% of the vote - unprecedented here in Scotland.She says that gives her leverage to push David Cameron. David Cameron says he wants to keep the nation together.The language coming out of Westminster last week was very much a cordial one. 'We will listen'.Nicola Sturgeon has warned him that if he doesn't listen, then the people of Scotland will judge him accordingly.Ms  Sturgeon described the hour-long talks at her official residence at Bute House as ""constructive and business-like"". She said Mr Cameron had made a ""commitment"" that the Smith proposals would be implemented ""as agreed"".""But secondly the prime minister agreed that he would look at proposals that we would now send to suggest the areas we can go beyond Smith,"" Ms Sturgeon said.""There was no agreement in terms of the substance of that but we will submit those proposals, the prime minister has said they will consider them and there will be a meeting to look at how we take that further forward.""Referring to her party's success in last week's general election, which saw the SNP win 56 out of 59 Scottish seats, Ms Sturgeon said: ""People in Scotland have now voted fairly convincingly for the SNP and sent a message that we want the Smith Commission proposals to go further and be built on.""The ball is in his court but I'm going into this in good faith.""She added: ""David Cameron and I are a world apart politically but, where we can, I'm determined to do business in the interests of the people of Scotland and across the UK.""She said she would have a ""constructive and business-like"" relationship with the prime minister. The two leaders shook hands on the front steps of Bute House as Mr Cameron arrived. Mr Cameron left the building shortly before 11:00, almost an hour after he had arrived.The two sides agreed to hold more regular discussions in the future, possibly quarterly. "

I'm human, the rest of my life is more important to me than politics.""The shadow business secretary has been distressed by the degree of scrutiny he, his family and his girlfriend have come under since he declared his intention to stand for the labour leadership.I am told that this includes reporters waiting outside the houses of relatives late at night.Friends of Mr Umunna deny that he is nervous of not getting the support of enough MPs to run for the leadership; they point out that he already has half the necessary names and that there are some weeks to go.The shadow business secretary now wants to play a leading role in arguing that Britain should stay in the EU and does not rule out seeking the leadership in the future.He said he thought he had understood ""the scrutiny and attention a leadership contest would bring"", but added: ""However, since the night of our defeat last week I have been subject to the added level of pressure that comes with being a leadership candidate.""The shadow business secretary said he had wondered if it was too soon for him to stand for the leadership, and ""I fear it was."" He also cited concerns about the impact on ""the rest of one's life"" and those close to him.""Consequently, after further reflection, I am withdrawing my candidacy,"" he said.Mr Umunna said he would continue to serve as shadow business secretary and hoped to ""play a leading role"" in Labour's campaign to keep the UK in the EU during the forthcoming in/out referendum.Commenting on the news, Labour former culture secretary Ben Bradshaw - who is expected to run for deputy leader - said Mr Umunna was a ""terrible loss"" to the field.He told the BBC's Daily Politics the Streatham MP had been the candidate the Conservative Party ""feared the most"".""And if it's the result of pressure on an extended family or an extended group of friends, I think that's a very sad reflection on our political culture,"" he said.Chuka Umunna feels ""liberated"", he told me, by his decision to quit the Labour leadership race.He hopes to be given a good role (shadow chancellor, I wonder?) by whoever becomes Labour leader. And I expect he'll become very high profile in the campaign to keep Britain in Europe, which is increasingly looking like it will be next May.He'll endorse a candidate in the next four weeks before nominations close. It will be very interesting to see who he piles in behind.Read more from Allegra (see post 13.23).Former Labour leader Lord Kinnock said he thought Mr Umunna had made the right decision.He said: ""If he felt in his soul that he wasn't prepared to subject himself - and more importantly his family - to the kind of attention which is fairly typical, sadly, these days, he has done absolutely the right thing.""There is no point at all in inflicting avoidable, unnecessary misery on those you love most.""Leadership contender Mary Creagh said she had ""huge respect"" for Mr Umunna, telling BBC Radio 4's World at One programme it took ""courage"" to withdraw from the leadership race.Mr Umunna was ""a big beast"" and would play a ""big role"" in the future of the Labour Party, she added.Yvette Cooper, Andy Burnham, Liz Kendall and Mary Creagh have already thrown their hats into the ring for Labour's top job while a number of other potential candidates, including Dan Jarvis, Alan Johnson and David Lammy, have ruled themselves out. Candidates must secure nominations from 34 colleagues - 15% of the party's MPs - by 15 June to make it on to ballot papers, which will be sent to members in August ahead of the leader's election a month later."

However, Mr Justice Stuart Smith at Southwark Crown Court said there was a ""very strong likelihood"" a custodial sentence would follow.The jury heard how Mote submitted numerous false expenses claims for payment for work that organisations had allegedly carried out on his behalf.Mote claimed the money was to pay whistleblowers in cash through third parties. He also said he had been ""targeted for being an anti-EU MEP.""During his time an MEP he also made £250,000 legitimate expenses claims.No date has been set for the sentencing."

2015-05-08,Round-up: BBC experts' analysis,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/election-2015-32650417,"The political future of the United Kingdom has become clearer after the results of the general election emerged around the country.David Cameron says he hopes to govern for all of the UK after the Conservatives took 331 seats - enough to form a slender majority in the Commons.Labour has been all but wiped out by the SNP in Scotland and suffered a disappointing set of results elsewhere, while the Lib Dems are left with just eight MPs after many party heavyweights such as Vince Cable and Danny Alexander lost their seats.So with battles won and lost and the fall-out and celebrations beginning, BBC correspondents examine the implications and challenges that lie ahead for the new government - and for those whose political careers have been ended by voters.No pollster, no pundit, no political leader saw it coming - not even David Cameron himself.Governing parties don't gain seats. Parties that have implemented painful cuts and are promising more certainly don't. Until that is the Conservative Party did - achieving what had seemed to be Mission Impossible - a Tory majority.Until that is David Cameron's personal triumph which triggered the near simultaneous resignation of his three principle opponents - Messrs Miliband, Clegg and Farage.They did so in part because they helped to crush their partners in coalition these last five years - reducing the Liberal Democrat parliamentary party to a size when it can fit into two London taxis and still have two seats to spare.In part because the extraordinary tidal wave of support for the SNP swept dozens of once safe Labour seats away.In part because Nigel Farage persuaded millions to vote for him but secured just one seat - not, though, the one he was standing in.Read more from Nick Robinson hereThe question uppermost in the prime minister's mind as he assembles his new government is how to keep the kingdom united.""Above all I want to bring our country together,"" he revealed after the result, ""to reclaim a mantle we should never have lost - the mantle of one nation, one United Kingdom"".Looking at the political landscape from Land's End today is very different to the view from John O'Groats.A sea of Conservative and Unionist blue dominates the scene across much of England, while a field of SNP nationalist yellow stretches to the horizon and beyond from the north.David Cameron's greatest challenge is to prevent the union he supports being torn apart by mutual resentment - resentment from Scotland at a Westminster government dominated by English Tories, and resentment from England at the preferential treatment people think is being given to the Scots.Those who assumed the future of the Union had been safeguarded by the Scottish referendum must think again.Read more from Mark Easton hereOne thing is rock-solid true: the Conservatives who worked on this campaign are as surprised by the result as the pollsters, pundits, politicians and general population.Maybe they shouldn't be - the economy is in good shape and the Conservatives had incumbency advantage.But when I travelled back from the prime minister's last rally with a group of exhausted Conservative campaign officials it was clear that 290 seats was a hoped-for target.No-one talked about anything over 300 seats, and no-one even mentioned an overall majority.So what special sauce pushed David Cameron into No 10 with a Commons majority?Mr Cameron had two simple messages in the campaign and he rarely veered away from them; the first - the economy is in good shape and the recovery is threatened by Labour. And the second - the SNP would hold a Labour-led government to ransom.Read more from Jonny Dymond hereBrian Taylor, BBC political editor, ScotlandOf all the comments on the overnight apocalypse, undoubtedly the most straightforward came from a defeated Scottish Labour MP.Since there were quite a few of them, let me narrow the focus a little. Come on down, Tom Harris.Mr Harris had plainly anticipated defeat. Nonetheless, he looked suitably lugubrious as his fate was confirmed.Why, he was asked eagerly, had Labour lost? ""Because we did not win enough votes.""Psephologically, it is perfect. Complete in itself. Psychologically, it sums up Labour's gloom without descending into subsidiary matters such as leadership, strategy and the rest. As a forward-thinking strategy, it is ideal. Win more votes. Simple.Read more from Brian Taylor hereThis has been an election which may have more profound consequences than almost any in living memory.We now face a generational decision about our future in Europe, with an EU referendum in two years' time almost certain.There will also be serious questions about the future of the Union, following an SNP landslide that has turned Scotland into a virtual one-party state.David Cameron's victory also represents a colossal achievement.Only once before in recent history has an incumbent government increased its majority - and that was Mrs Thatcher in her prime in the 1980s.It is also a significant personal victory for Mr Cameron and a rebuff for those in his party who had become increasingly sceptical about his ability to win.But while it may represent a defeat for those Tories who saw this election as a potential opportunity to rid themselves of David Cameron, he must now govern with a wafer-thin majority.For the SNP, their stunning victory can only increase the pressure on Nicola Sturgeon to include a commitment to a second independence referendum in her party's manifesto for next year's Scottish elections.It is an election which has not just defied all the predictions of the pollsters and pundits - but which may yet prompt the most fundamental re-casting of British politics for a generation.Read more from Norman Smith hereAfter an extraordinary night, some brief conclusions:Read more from James Landale hereIs this the end of the union?That is the question many people will be asking this morning after the party which has fought for Scottish independence for 80 years swept to victory.The answer from the jubilant Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon is a firm ""No"".She insists that her MPs will speak for all of Scotland, not just for the 45% who voted for the country to leave the United Kingdom last September.In the closing hours of the most extraordinary election campaign which anyone in Scotland can remember, Ms Sturgeon turned to talk of ""legitimacy.""That will be her watchword in the coming days as she argues that the prime minister cannot ignore the democratic will of the Scottish people.Politically, Scotland and England this morning look and feel like very different countries.Read more from James Cook hereAfter weeks of chatter about an election too close to call, it wasn't that close at all.David Cameron will be continuing as our prime minister.So, what is all this likely to mean?A referendum on whether the UK stays in, or leaves, the European Union, within the next two-and-a-half years.A race to be the next leader of the Labour Party.A race to be the next leader of the Liberal Democrats.And a huge new presence of Scottish National Party MPs at Westminster.And so here's another thing we know for certain this morning: Politics ain't going to be boring any time soon.Read more from Chris Mason hereFor Labour the story of their terrible night is rapidly turning into the search for a new leader. So who will that be?Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, is almost certain to run.  Even before this election, both he and another almost inevitable candidate, Chuka Umunna, had raised eyebrows inside the party at the work they had put in, preparing the ground with members and the unions for potential bids.Yvette Cooper, before the election, was still thought not to have made up her mind over whether to run. That decision has been made perhaps a little easier as her husband, Ed Balls, has lost his seat.She is certainly potentially in the frame, along with two lesser known names - Liz Kendall and Dan Jarvis - two MPs who were only elected in 2010 for the first time. This could be their moment. But whoever is in the job, they face a monumental task.Read Laura Kuenssberg's Twitter hereSterling is up (the most for seven years against the euro), share prices are up (especially bank shares like Lloyds and RBS, and energy shares such as Centrica), government bond prices are up.To state the obvious, investors love the Tories' general election victory.There are a few reasons.One (no surprise here) is that Labour's threat of breaking up banks and imposing energy price caps has been lifted.Second is that investors have been discounting days and weeks of wrangling after polling day over who would form the government - and so they are semi-euphoric that we already know who's in charge.Third, many investors tend to be economically conservative and instinctively Conservative.But although the City may be a bit drunk on the result, its pleasure in Ed Miliband's and Ed Balls' humiliation may be making it a bit blind - perhaps dangerously so - to some bumps in the economic road ahead.Read more from Robert Peston hereNigel Farage dreamed of holding the balance of power, but in the end his UKIP party is now worse off than when it came into the election.At the seventh time of asking he was rejected - this time by the people of Thanet South. It was a similar story in Rochester and Strood where Mark Reckless, who sensationally defected from the Tories last year, was also sent packing.In seats on UKIP's target list, like Thurrock in Essex, the party failed to make gains. In Grimsby - where Mr Farage went twice in the last six weeks - they came third.UKIP got around four million votes - with especially strong showings in north-east and south-east England - but it's ended up with just one MP, and a vacancy at the top. This has led to UKIP attacking the current system of choosing MPs, which it's described as ""busted"" and ""dysfunctional"".In one sense, this campaign was a complete failure and it's left an aftermath of angry voters, and others wondering if the UKIP bubble has burst.Read Robin Brant's Twitter hereI monitored 91 GB-wide voting intention polls during the 2015 election campaign and found nothing in them to prepare me for the final outcome.The good news for the pollsters was that their share for the Lib Dems was pretty close, as were the shares for UKIP, the Greens and the catch-all category of Others.The bad news for the polling industry was that the crucial shares for Conservative and Labour were the ones where they came most adrift.When all the qualifications of margins of error are allowed, there did appear to be a systematic overstatement of the Labour share and an equally systematic understatement of the Conservative one.It is for the pollsters to decide whether to conduct a review of their performance but I trust they will avoid the initial knee-jerk reaction of the immediate aftermath of the 1992 polls debacle.This general election performance follows the performance of the polls in the 2014 Scottish referendum where the choice was simply binary and yet all the polls were out by between 4-6%.Something is wrong. A lot of us would like to know what it is.Read more from David Cowling hereThe words ""political earthquake"" have been translated into numerous European languages, making front page news across the continent.While Britons now examine the domestic minutiae of the election result, here in mainland Europe the vote means one thing: a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU.

David Cameron's victory also represents a colossal achievement.""James Landale, deputy political editor: ""After an extraordinary night, some brief conclusions: With a small majority or slight minority for David Cameron, Tory MPs will be much empowered. As such, Mr Cameron will need support from other parties to get business through.

2015-05-08,A history of political plots,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32749971,"Nigel Farage has apparently seen off a challenge to his leadership of UKIP - a move described by his former election strategist as a ""coup"". He's not the only party leader to face an attempted ousting. But can you recover from such a revolt?In 2006, the Labour prime minister was the target of what became known as the ""curry house conspiracy"" - a coup to remove him and install his chancellor, Gordon Brown, as prime minister.It would lead to several of the plotters' resignations - but not Mr Blair's. However, it was successful to a degree in that it forced the party leader into naming a departure date.The move against him was reportedly masterminded by Tom Watson, a defence minister at the time, who was also rumoured to have had a secret meeting with Mr Brown on the eve of the revolt.Apparently, Mr Watson and three fellow West Midlands MPs - Sion Simon, David Wright (both ministerial aides) and Khalid Mahmood - met over a biryani at a Wolverhampton curry house to discuss the PM's future, before dispatching a missive calling for him to quit.The letter - which attracted the support of a number of normally loyal Labour MPs - was leaked to the press, and ultimately resulted in Mr Watson's resignation.In his parting letter, the West Bromwich East MP took a shot at the prime minister, who he said should step down in the interests of party and country.Mr Blair denounced his actions and branded the former minister ""disloyal, discourteous and wrong"", saying he would have sacked him if he had not resigned.But Mr Watson's departure was swiftly followed by the resignations of six other junior members of government - who had also signed the rebel letter - in protest at the prime minister's refusal to say when he would step down as Labour leader.The whole affair resulted in Mr Blair announcing his intention to step aside within 12 months - which he duly did, on 27 June 2007.But it did nothing to quash internal dissent and speculation in the party over the future leadership of the party.Labour prime minister Gordon Brown found his leadership under threat in 2009 after one of his cabinet ministers dramatically quit the government and called for him to resign.Work and Pensions Secretary James Purnell - a former aide to Tony Blair - resigned from his post after the polls closed in the local and European elections, in which Labour was forecast to do badly.Explaining his decision to quit, Mr Purnell said the prime minister made a Conservative victory ""more, not less, likely"".It was Mr Brown's first direct challenge from a cabinet minister - but it would not topple the Labour leader as senior members of government refused to follow Mr Purnell's lead.Mr Brown was safe for the time being. But several months later, in January 2010, a fresh leadership challenge was mounted by two senior former Labour cabinet ministers.Geoff Hoon and Patricia Hewitt wrote to all Labour MPs, saying the party was ""deeply divided"" over Mr Brown's leadership and that the best way to resolve the issue was by way of secret ballot.They insisted it was not an ""attempted coup"" but a necessary step to resolve divisions within the party.But the duo could only muster the public support of a handful of backbenchers long-opposed to Mr Brown, with the majority of the party's MPs less than impressed by the move, which came just weeks before the general election.As the day wore on, a succession of cabinet ministers came out to back the PM, suggesting there was little momentum behind the plot - although it was noted that several were not exactly gushing in their support of Mr Brown.As history tells us, neither leadership challenge bore fruit but they reflected the internal doubts and divisions over Mr Brown at the helm.As leadership toppling attempts go, this one in 2014 was regarded as a particularly ""botched"" and ""shambolic coup"". Indeed, former Lib Dem leader Lord (Paddy) Ashdown described the move as a ""plot of deep malice"".Its instigator, Lord (Matthew) Oakeshott - a close ally of the-then Business Secretary Vince Cable - tried to unseat Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg.The peer was found to have commissioned secret polls suggesting the party would do better at the 2015 general election without Mr Clegg in the driving seat.The man Lord Oakeshott had long had in mind to take Mr Clegg's place - Mr Cable, who was on government business in China at the time - was forced to publicly condemn his friend's actions and state his backing for Mr Clegg.But Lord Oakeshott said the business secretary had in fact known about his polls and their findings.Nevertheless, the peer - who was denounced by the Lib Dem leadership for spending money that could have been spent on campaigning - quit the party, and issued a warning shot on his way out about the Lib Dems' future prospects.Mr Cable largely emerged unscathed but he faced questions about his loyalty to the leader. Although the two sought to put paid to reports of a rift with a (painfully awkward, 'nothing to see here, folks') stage-managed pint in a pub.Although the revolt failed, and Mr Clegg remained at the helm, the Lib Dems did go on to suffer a trouncing at the general election, losing nearly 50 of its MPs - one of them, Mr Cable himself - prompting his leader to quit.The Conservatives have a reputation for being more ruthless than their party rivals when it comes to getting rid of leaders they sense are no longer effectual.But, in 1995, Prime Minister John Major - tired of persistent rumours of a leadership challenge - decided to take the bull by the horns and trigger a surprise leadership election to silence his detractors.His own backbenchers had questioned Mr Major's ability to unite and lead the party, which was deeply divided over Europe.So ""put up or shut up"", he told them as he tendered his resignation as Conservative Party leader but not prime minister.But then stepped forward eurosceptic MP John Redwood, who resigned from the cabinet in order to contest Mr Major's leadership.This was unexpected by many, as the PM had said there had been assurances from his cabinet that none would stand against him.But Mr Major went on to win the ensuing election with a comfortable defeat over his challenger, who was not included in the PM's consequent cabinet reshuffle.No further contested leadership election took place until after the Conservatives' defeat at the 1997 general election, paving the way for William Hague to take over the running of the party.Not all attempts to oust a party leader end in failure: as Margaret Thatcher found out to her peril.With three electoral victories under her belt, the Conservative prime minister's downfall would come at the hands of her own party - not the voters.It was on 1 November 1990 when Geoffrey (now Lord) Howe - one of Mrs Thatcher's longest-serving ministers - resigned over differences with the party leader over Europe.In his now infamous speech on the floor of the House of Commons, he attacked the PM's policies and leadership style, comparing being one of her cabinet ministers to opening the batting at cricket only to find his bat had been ""broken... by the team captain"".It sparked the beginning of the end of the 11-year Thatcher reign.Michael (now Lord) Heseltine seized on the opportunity to challenge the prime minister in the ensuing leadership contest, from which she would eventually withdraw and John Major emerge as her successor. Reflecting on the revolt and its implications on the Conservative Party, Baroness Thatcher's biographer Charles Moore wrote: ""Because the coup was unjustified, and so trust broke down, the politics of the next 15 years were those of civil war."""
2015-05-08,Election swings and roundabouts,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-32741924,"If election manifesto claims are all about smoke and mirrors, should we now add swings and roundabouts to the political metaphor?There's an intriguing aspect to the general election results in the Midlands that puzzled me.It's the striking contrast in the swings between Labour and the Conservatives.David Cameron and his campaign strategists knew they were home and dry when Nuneaton was the first Midlands marginal to declare.It was not only a Tory hold but a swing to the Conservatives from Labour of 3%.I was in the Nottingham suburb of Beeston awaiting the result of the Broxtowe count. Would its high profile Conservative MP Anna Soubry survive a red surge?Nuneaton set the pattern. Across the Midlands, both east and west, there was a uniform swing of between three and four per cent to the Tories - Warwickshire North 3%, Amber Valley 4%, Derbyshire South 4% and Sherwood 4%. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan topped the Tory swingometer in the Midlands marginals with 5% in Loughborough.Yet in the big cities, it was a very different story. The swing went to Labour.So in Nottingham East they enjoyed a 6% swing, Nottingham South 5.8%, Leicester South 7.3%, Leicester West 5%, Birmingham Hall Green 12%, Birmingham Hodge Hill 8%.If swings to Labour on this scale had gone beyond the city ring road roundabouts and into the suburbs, Ed Miliband would have become prime minister by now.In confidence, one senior Labour insider in Nottingham told me its success in the city wards was down to organisation, experience and its teams of activists.""We won the ground war. If Nottingham's city boundaries were extended into Sherwood and Broxtowe, we would have won those constituencies as well,"" he told me.Labour leadership candidate, Leicester West's Liz Kendall has identified her party's problem beyond the ring road roundabout.It's about reaching out to Middle England.""We need to show people that we understand their aspirations and ambitions for the future,"" she told the Sunday Times.The problem for Labour was that Middle England was not interested in what the party offered…and still isn't. The Cameron brand worked its magic in those Midlands marginals... it'll take something or someone special to break up that ballot box relationship."
2015-05-08,Royal 'lobbying',https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32740154,"Prince Charles sent 27 letters to then Prime Minister Tony Blair and members of his government between September 2004 and March 2005, ""despite the Freedom of Information Act!"" as the prince joked in one.But did his suggestions and concerns have any bearing on the behaviour of Mr Blair's government?The request: Prince Charles expresses his worries over an EU directive on complementary medicines ""which is… effectively outlawing the use of certain herbal extracts"".  Mr Blair replied, offering moral support and practical help. He agreed that ""the implementation as it is currently planned is crazy"" and set out an action plan that included delaying implementation for all existing products to 2011. What happened: Herbal products were not required to be authorised until 2011, just as Mr Blair had promised. Prince Charles continues to sell his own brand of complementary products, Duchy Herbals, through Boots and Waitrose. The request: Writing to Mr Blair, the prince expresses a ""growing sense of anxiety"" that the Hill Farming Allowance, which supports farmers working on Britain's uplands, could be scrapped. In his reply, the prime minister said he understood that the Hill Farm Allowance would continue until 2007. What happened: The allowance lasted until the end of Labour's tenure in 2010, when it was abolished.The request: Just 18 months after the US-led invasion of Iraq, Prince Charles raised the issue of poor performance of Lynx helicopters in high temperatures, saying: ""I fear that this is just one more example of where our Armed Forces are being asked to do an extremely challenging job (particularly in Iraq) without the necessary resources.""Mr Blair replied: ""On the subject of the Lynx helicopter, the limitations of the existing platform, particularly in the extremely challenging environment within Iraq, are well recognised by the Ministry of Defence."" He added that replacement of the helicopters would be a priority. What happened: Mr Blair's comments go much further than what he was saying about the subject at the time. In the event, though, the fleet was not fully upgraded until 2011.The request: Prince Charles lamented that the government's TB prevention plans might not ""include a commitment to deal with the badger problem in the immediate future"" and pushed strongly for a cull, saying: ""All I can say is that I do urge you to look again at introducing a proper cull of badgers where it is necessary.""Mr Blair sympathised, saying he could ""personally see the case for culling badgers"". However, he was unwilling to commit to a cull.  What happened: Culling trials were conducted from 1998-2005. The final results, published in 2008, said that the badger cull could ""make no meaningful contribution"" to curbing bovine TB. It wasn't until 2013 that a full culling programme began in two pilot areas. These ended with the conclusion that the pilots had been neither humane nor effective at curbing the spread of TB.The request: Then Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell wrote to Prince Charles to say she had decided to give parts of the historic Smithfield meat market Grade II listed status, and was trying to persuade deputy prime minister John Prescott to ""call in"" the planning application to prevent demolition of other parts of the site. She had been swayed by evidence provided by Sir Neil Cossons, who was English Heritage chair at the time, after he had been asked by the prince to add his support. Prince Charles replied that he was ""extremely glad to read of your appreciation of the value of this group of buildings"". According to the Guardian, market workers desperate to see the redevelopment of the site invited the prince to meet them to discuss it, but his office said he was ""unlikely to accept as he did not want to interfere in the planning process"".What happened: Smithfield market is still the subject of planning battles a decade on. Successive planning applications have been refused by ministers. Last year then Communities Secretary Eric Pickles rejected plans for an office development on the site, stating that ""the extent of damage that the application would cause to the important heritage assets at Smithfield runs entirely counter to national and policy objectives intended to protect such assets from harm"".In March, the Museum of London announced a move from its current Barbican site to the Smithfield market building."
2015-05-08,Election fallout,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32703139,"""Some of those gimmicks - that tombstone, whatever idiot thought that up I do not know!""I was talking to the former Mayor of Crawley in Sussex, John Mortimer, in the town's Labour Supporters Club about the vexed question of what went wrong, and where Labour should go next. This seat is one of those southern seats Labour hoped to take, but failed.I hear a whole range of views in the club.""They didn't give nothing to depend on, they should be clear, and a little bit more down to Earth."" ""Good party, wrong leader, they don't look after business enough.""Councillor John Stanley tells me: ""I think in a way we did go too left, but now we can go a bit centre-left, or centre, depending who the new leader is.""The former mayor sums up the mood on the doorstep: ""Whatever we told them, they didn't believe us.""  Expect to hear all those views, and more, in the coming leadership contest. Step back from the angst of supporters, and it may not be that hard to see why Labour failed.  An economic recovery, hailed by independent organisations as the result of government policy, undid a party that had loudly proclaimed for five years that the coalition's policies would lead to economic disaster. Combine that with an uncharismatic and uninspirational leader, then you might argue no further debate is necessary.Fat chance of that. Defeat breeds resentment, and this one has opened up old divisions.  A chorus of Blairties, led by the man himself, has declared that Ed's problem was ignoring those with aspiration and ambition, failing to appeal to those running business. Incidentally, I've been ticked off by the perspicacious editor of the New Statesman, Jason Cowley, for using the ""unhelpful"" term ""Blairites"".I can't think of another description that fits Tony, Lord Mandelson, Lord Adonis and David Miliband quite so well. But call them what you will, the message was clear - Ed was too left wing, Labour should move back to the centre, or, if you like, to the right.Reading Mr Blair's pithy analysis, listening to Lord Mandelson's gripping and savage eloquence, describing a party sent out to shout: ""We love the poor and hate the rich,"" and so ignoring the middle, and you realise strong emotions are in play.But back to the future may not be sufficient. Of course elections are won on the centre ground. But grandees grinding axes, affronted by the failure of boys who used to make their tea, may be creating so much noise that they can't hear more insistent sounds.  For there are several elephants trumpeting loudly as they cram into the small space of the shadow cabinet room. Imagine these beasts are as gaily decorated as Berlin buddy bears. One is decked out in red, another in imperial purple bunting, and another, a mammoth, strong tusked and ice rimmed, painted yellow with tartan trimmings.Take the last first. The Scottish wipeout is Labour's biggest problem. Fail to solve it, and Labour can forget ever having a comfortable majority again. It is hard to argue Labour were wiped out in Scotland because the SNP outflanked them to the right with their appeal to the business community and the ambitious and aspirational. But it is true the SNP drew in to people from left, right and centre, just as the modernisers say Labour should. It was the politics of economic self-interest, but cast in a very different light. Tribally sneering at ""the reactionary ideology of nationalism"" as Mr Blair does, will not reach the central belt of Scotland, the middle ground of  Midlothian.What about that purple pachyderm?  In Crawley - in fact in seat after seat - there is a similar pattern.  Labour did, in fact, often increase the size of their vote. So did the Conservatives, usually by a bit more. But the real dynamic was the total collapse of the Lib Dems and the dramatic rise of UKIP. The increase in votes for Nigel Farage's party wasn't translated into parliamentary seats, but, although it is early days in terms of research, it probably hurt Labour a lot. If we believe - and I do - Matthew Goodwin and Rob Ford, authors of Revolt on the Right, these voters are often former Labour supporters - older, less educated, those left behind on the tides of  globalisation, stranded on the shores of post-industrialisation. They may have had too many disappointments to feel much ambition or aspiration. They are a challenge for Labour, and any new leader will spend a good deal of time thinking how to deal with the concerns of Europe and immigration.Whether to share their fears, or confront them will be a big decision.Which brings us to Red Nellie. Those members who still proudly call themselves socialist. This is not about Old Labour - they are more likely to be baristas or barristers than boilermakers. It is easy as an outsider, as a journalist, to treat politics as an intellectual game about how best to win power - but many people, particularly the foot soldiers, particularly after the death of  purely tribal loyalties, are in it because they passionately believe in winning  power to do something specific.Many of them are suspicious of the later incarnations of New Labour, not because it reached an accommodation with wealth and business, but because it seemed to worship at the same altar, to regard the party's core beliefs in redistribution and equality as childish fantasies from a past age.Perhaps to Mr Blair, they are the problem, people who may equate ""ambition"" with greed. They might point out that a man who claims to be worth ""only"" £20m may find it harder than most to squeeze through the eye of a needle to understand their point of view. Most successful Labour leaders will confront the left at some point, but the concerns of this group go to the existential question ""What is the party for?""This is not a polemic - not an argument about what should be done, but a reflection on the complex conundrums that will face any new Labour leader, the tearing apart of the old alliance that made up a Labour majority, and so the political need to satisfy groups with very different, indeed, contradictory demands. But looking for a Social Democratic universal theory of everything may be missing the point. What the party desperately wants is a leader who can pull the disparate threads together and articulate them as common purpose. Whether she or he exists is another matter.Much more on that in the coming months."
2015-05-08,'Take us with you',https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-32736153,"Thousands of people in the north of England have been using the hashtag ""take us with you Scotland"" to express their upset about the result of last week's general election, and Scottish nationalists are welcoming this English minority with open arms. Last Thursday's general election was a rough one for the Labour Party in its traditional stronghold in the north of England. But further to the north, the left-leaning Scottish National Party won nearly every seat it contested. That political contrast has made some left-wing voters in places like Manchester, Leeds and Sheffield look fondly on their neighbours. Since last Thursday's election in Britain the phrase ""take us with you Scotland"" has been used more than 24,000 times. ""Genuinely beginning to wonder if the North of England becoming a part of Scotland would be better for us, I really am,"" tweeted Aaron Miller from Yorkshire. Some cracked jokes under the tag after the North West Motorway Police account, which gives traffic updates, announced that they had ""picked up a pedestrian on the M62 who was trying to walk to Scotland.""After an initial spike of jokes over the weekend, the hashtag really took off when users start to mobilise in support of around a year-old petition on the campaigning site Change.org. The petition calls for the north of England to secede from the rest of the country and join up with Scotland, and more than 12,000 people have signed it.Its creator, a Sheffield resident who calls himself ""Stu Dent"", set it up to coincide with last year's Scottish independence referendum, and he also created a map imagining the boundary of a ""Scotland plus the north"" country.Stu Dent runs the Twitter account Hunters Bar, named after an area of southwest Sheffield which is very popular with - you guessed it - students. Despite the account having thousands of followers on Twitter, when the map was first posted last year, the image was shared only about 100 times - however, in the past week it's been retweeted by thousands. Stu Dent told BBC Trending that he was surprised at how popular his idea has become. ""In hindsight, perhaps I shouldn't have been,"" he said. ""There is a huge frustration in parts of the UK about the things that have happened since 2010.""""I think people need a place to go where they can say 'not in my name!

2015-05-08,What Britain wants from Europe,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32695399,"David Cameron says he has a mandate to pursue EU reform following the Conservatives' general election victory. The PM, who will be hoping his majority government will give him extra leverage in Brussels, wants to renegotiate the terms of the UK's membership ahead of a referendum by the end of 2017. He has said he will campaign for Britain to remain in the EU if he gets the reforms he wants.Mr Cameron has said he does not want to reveal full details of his negotiating hand but he has given a broad indication, in a series of speeches and newspaper articles, of his priorities when he goes into talks with other EU leaders.These are: The prime minister has said Britain would resist any move towards a European Army and that he wants to free British police forces from EU interference. He has also ruled out Britain joining the euro.But he has placed less emphasis in recent years on demanding changes to EU social policy, such as the maximum 48-hour working week, agency workers, maternity leave and non-discrimination rules.The official UK government position is that a referendum will be held by the end of 2017 but Downing Street sources have said: ""If we can do it earlier we will.""There is speculation David Cameron is planning to hold the vote in 2016 to avoid a clash with French and German elections in 2017.The prime minister wants treaty change but even if the referendum was held in 2017 there may not be enough time to legally incorporate any reforms into a treaty and it would have to be done at a later stage.An early referendum would anger Eurosceptics who believe it would not allow enough time to make the case for exit or negotiate any meaningful concessions.""A rushed process would severely undermine the chances to secure a significant deal that both British business and voters could support and would waste the opportunity of a lifetime,"" Matthew Elliott, chief executive of Business for Britain told Breitbart London.The question is always crucial in any referendum and there is already a debate about what it should be. The Draft European Union (Referendum) Bill, published by the Conservatives in 2013, proposed this form of words: ""Do you think that the United Kingdom should remain a member of the European Union?""Some thought that leaned too far towards the status quo, encouraging a yes vote, and the Electoral Commission said it was not clear and direct enough. The watchdog proposed this form of words instead: ""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union?""The new Conservative government will attempt to repeal the Human Rights Act, which requires UK courts to treat the European Court of Human Rights as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. The European Court of Human Rights is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe (CoE), which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine.The freedom for people to move around Europe, enshrined in the EU treaties, works in parallel with the other three basic freedoms in the single market: freedom of goods, capital and services.It is likely to be a ""red line"" for other EU leaders, who do not want to see it eroded.Mr Cameron has steered clear of tackling it directly - for example by asking for an emergency ""brake"" on free movement, or a cap on numbers - focusing instead on reducing the incentive provided by welfare payments. In a speech last November, David Cameron set out measures to reduce the number of EU nationals moving to the UK.His main proposals were:Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission, has said he is ready to work with Mr Cameron to ""strike a fair deal for the United Kingdom in the EU"". The leaders of other EU nations have previously warned they are unlikely to support major changes to EU treaties to accommodate British demands. But Mr Cameron's general election victory may have given him extra leverage. ""The ball is very much in the court of the UK now,"" a senior EU official told The Guardian. ""It's up to the British to define what they want."" The key figure will be German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is very keen to keep Britain in the EU but has so far been unwilling to make major concessions to enable that to happen. There are fears that a ""pick and mix"" approach to EU treaties would undermine EU cohesion.Mr Cameron has said there is ""no doubt"" his planned reforms will require changes to the treaties governing the European Union. But this would require the unanimous support of all EU members, and may not be possible within the deadline he has set of a referendum before the end of 2017. Any attempt to change EU laws on free movement would meet fierce resistance from some EU nations, particularly Eastern European states. Mr Juncker has said free movement is non-negotiable.Mr Cameron may find it difficult to get unanimous support for his proposals for a four-year waiting period for migrant workers claiming UK benefits. East European EU members would be likely to oppose this, on the grounds that it would discriminate against their citizens.  Attempts to secure opt-outs for the City are unlikely to go down well with other European leaders.However, there are precedents for EU treaty changes to accommodate some countries' specific concerns - for example, the protocol attached to the Lisbon Treaty for Ireland.Mr Cameron has faced repeated calls to say whether he would campaign for Britain's exit from the EU in the referendum if he fails to get what he wants from the renegotiation process. All he has said is that he will ""rule nothing out"". Some Conservative MPs want Britain to leave the EU no matter what David Cameron manages to renegotiate. A larger group are likely to want more concessions than Mr Cameron has so far indicated he is prepared to demand.Senior backbencher David Davis, who was defeated by Mr Cameron for the Tory leadership in 2005, told the Daily Telegraph the majority of the 332 Conservative MPs want Mr Cameron to negotiate an ""opt-out"" power to stop individual EU laws from applying to Britain. The prime minister has said this would be ""impossible"" without Britain leaving the EU.Mr Davis claims as many as 60 Tory MPs would be prepared to rebel and vote for Britain's exit from the EU if the prime minister fails to deliver.Graham Brady, chairman of the Tory backbench 1922 committee, which represents backbenchers, has urged David Cameron to give all Conservative MPs, including ministers, a free vote in the EU referendum.In January, Mr Cameron warned that serving cabinet ministers would have to quit the government if they wanted to campaign to leave the EU if he had secured the reforms to it he wants.In the 1975 referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Economic Community, as the EU was then called, Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson decided to suspend collective responsibility because his cabinet was split on the issue. Ministers were allowed to vote with their consciences and campaign against each other. The majority of them, including Mr Wilson, joined the Yes camp, but left-wingers, such as Tony Benn, played a leading role in the No campaign. The Yes campaign won easily with 67% of the vote."

2015-05-09,Scots Labour leader Murphy to resign,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32760196,"Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy is to resign next month, he has announced.It comes despite Mr Murphy narrowly surviving a vote of no confidence at a meeting of the party's national executive in Glasgow. Mr Murphy said he would tender his resignation alongside a plan to reform the party.He lost his seat in last week's general election as the SNP won 56 of the 59 Scottish seats, leaving Labour with a single MP in Scotland.Mr Murphy said he wanted to have a successor as leader in place by the summer, and confirmed he would not be standing for a seat at the Scottish Parliament in next year's election. Instead, he said it was time to ""do something else"" and that he believed the party would continue to be divided if he remained as leader. His deputy, Kezia Dugdale MSP, will become acting leader until a permanent successor is found. Mr Murphy had faced calls to resign from several MSPs, trade unions and former MPs in the wake of his party's near wipeout at the general election.He insisted he had decided to stand down ahead of the national executive voting by 17-14 in favour of him staying in the job.Speaking at a media conference after the national executive meeting, he said: ""It is clear that a small minority who didn't accept my election as leader of the Scottish Labour Party just five months ago won't accept the vote of the executive today and that will continue to divide the party.""Today I received more support in the executive vote than I did from members of the executive when I stood for election five months ago.""He said it would be up to the executive whether to accept the reforms he would be proposing before he left the post. But he warned: ""A party in such urgent need of reform blocks those changes at its peril.""The former East Renfrewshire MP said Labour had been crushed between ""two nationalisms"" in Scotland and England.Mr Murphy said he left no legacy of bitterness for anyone in the Labour Party, and the only person he was angry at was the person who blamed Scottish Labour for the party's UK-wide general election defeat - a reference to Unite leader Len McCluskey.And he said that in many ways Scottish Labour was the ""least modernised part of the Labour movement"" and that he wanted his successor to be elected under a one member, one vote system.Mr Murphy added: ""The Labour Party's problem is not the link with trade unions, or even the relationship with Unite members - far from it. It is the destructive behaviour of one high profile trade unionist.""The leader of the Scottish Labour Party doesn't serve at the grace of Len McCluskey, and the next leader of the UK Labour Party should not be picked by Len McCluskey.""Mr McCluskey has been a vocal critic of Mr Murphy's leadership and opposed his appointment in December when Mr Murphy won the contest to replace Johann Lamont.Jim Murphy laughed and joked with Scottish Labour's sole MP as he made his way down the hotel corridor to announce his resignation.He certainly brought energy and dynamism to his election campaign - but all that achieved was Ian Murray in Edinburgh South.So as Mr Murphy bows out, who could replace him?The deputy leader Kezia Dugdale may want to step up or Neil Findlay could try again after challenging last time. Maybe the party's finance spokeswoman Jackie Baillie thinks her steady hand could steer the ship.Jenny Marra is also often talked about as future face of the party.Whoever steps into Jim Murphy's red shoes he or she will have to face a difficult 2016 Holyrood election, to put it mildly.There are also more fundamental questions about how the party can possibly move on as it faces a surging SNP.Mr Murphy was very much a creature of ""New Labour"" - but to today's generation that's old Labour.Party members may start looking for someone with no links to the past, neither a Brownite nor a Blairite. A 'cleanskin' - as the politicos put it - may well help re-connect with voters.That's a long way from now though - even some of the party's opponents may view this latest train wreck with a modicum of sympathy. Ms Lamont had resigned after claiming Scottish Labour was treated like a ""branch office"" by the London-based party leadership.Mr Murphy concluded his speech by saying: ""Scotland needs a strong Labour party; Scotland needs a united Labour party. We have been the greatest force for change in our nation's remarkable history. ""The Scottish Labour party will rise again. It will be under someone else's leadership and I am confident about my party's future.""Harriet Harman MP, acting leader of the UK Labour Party, said it would be for Scottish Labour to choose a new leader. She added: ""As a cabinet minister and leader of his party in Scotland, Jim has been a hugely important figure in the Labour Party. He leaves with the best wishes and thanks of our movement.""Labour peer Lord McConnell, a former Scottish first minister, said the party's problems were ""much deeper than one individual and one affiliate"".He said: ""We have a disconnect locally and nationally with wider Scottish society. ""We have a problem with our political positioning in the post devolution age where the party particularly at the UK level has never been comfortable with success in the Scottish parliament and has always tried to see things through a UK prism rather than a Scottish prism.""We need to find a new generation, a new leader, new generation, new ideas, a fresh approach.""In a tweet, Scottish first minister and SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said: ""I wish Jim Murphy all the very best for the future. Leadership is not easy and he deserves credit for standing up for what he believes in.""Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson also reacted on Twitter, saying: ""Jim Murphy announces a managed exit in order to help the party, which is to his credit. But leaves a tough gig for whoever comes next.""The meeting of Scottish Labour's executive was disrupted by protesters who entered the party's headquarters.Police were called and the protesters, who included persistent anti-austerity activists Sean Clerkin and Piers Doughty-Brown, left the building to protest further from the street outside.The protesters were calling for Mr Murphy to remain as leader to ""finish the job of destroying Scottish Labour"".A Police Scotland spokeswoman said officers had been called and found two protestors on the third floor of the building. She added: ""Both left on police arrival. Advice and assistance was given."""
2015-05-09,Labour contenders clash on spending,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32761561,"Prospective Labour leaders have clashed over Labour's record in government in their first public debate in the race to succeed Ed Miliband.Former cabinet ministers including Yvette Cooper and Andy Burnham defended Labour's fiscal record and spending on schools and hospitals.However, candidates from the 2010 intake of MPs argued that the party spent too much while in office.The debate followed Chuka Umunna's withdrawal from the leadership contest.The remaining candidates appeared at the annual conference of the Progress think tank in London.There was agreement that Labour needed to demonstrate economic credibility to regain power, with shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt telling the meeting that the party needed to be ""trusted with public finances and the family finances"".Mr Hunt, who was first elected to Parliament in 2010 when Labour lost power, argued the last Labour government ""spent too much"" and failed to ""leave enough economic headroom to deal with the economic crisis and the recession"".Shadow health minister Liz Kendall said: ""There's absolutely nothing progressive about spending more on debt interest payments than on educating our children.""But shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: ""The Tories have had a triumph of spin over the facts in saying what they said about the economic record of the last Labour government.""The former chief secretary to the Treasury said the deficit did ""grow too large"" in the government's later years but insisted: ""The last Labour government ran more surpluses in its first term than the Tories did in 18 years.""Yvette Cooper, another former chief secretary to the Treasury, said: ""We should never let anybody tell us that it was too many teachers, doctors or nurses that caused Lehman Brothers bank in New York to crash.""Shadow international development secretary Mary Creagh said: ""People have forgotten the economic credibility that the last Labour government had.""She said Labour had built schools and hospitals that were ""treasured in our communities"".Ms Cooper, Mr Burnham, Ms Kendall and Ms Creagh have declared their intention to run for leader, while Mr Hunt told the conference he would make an announcement next week.At the same event, shadow energy secretary Caroline Flint announced she would be running for deputy leader.The Don Valley MP told the Today programme ahead of the debate that Labour lost the election because ""fundamentally the public did not trust us on the economy"".Exeter MP Ben Bradshaw has already announced a bid to be deputy, saying Labour ""must and could win the next election"", but only if it ""broadens its appeal by adopting sensible, centre-left politics which celebrate wealth creation and entrepreneurship"".Former Labour campaign co-ordinator Tom Watson is reported to be crowd-funding a deputy leadership bid, while Walthamstow MP Stella Creasy has said she is ""open to the question"" of running.Barnsley East MP and shadow transport secretary Michael Dugher - a fierce critic of Ed Miliband's election campaign - is to run Mr Burnham's campaign, according to the website LabourList.It is reported that Mr Burnham also has the backing of Labour peer Lord Falconer, who was lord chancellor and justice secretary under Tony Blair and was close to the former PM.Shadow culture secretary Chris Bryant has signalled his backing for Ms Cooper, tweeting that the next leader must be ""someone who's been tried in the fiery furnace of public opinion"".Mr Hunt said on Friday he would be be attending the debate - along with the other four hopefuls - to ""set out my analysis on how we begin to understand what went so wrong and why"".He added: ""We must use this leadership election to ask some very profound questions.""All voices in the party must be heard so that we can have a full and proper assessment as to why the politics of nationalism triumphed in Scotland and huge swathes of England, and how we have allowed the Conservative Party to present a more compelling vision for Britain to so many millions of people.""Speculation still surrounds shadow business secretary Mr Umunna's decision to pull out on Friday, when he said he was not ""comfortable"" with the ""pressure"" of being a candidate.As well as citing extensive pressure and scrutiny Mr Umunna also said he was ruling himself out because of concerns about the impact of the bid on his family.A rising star of the party, Mr Umunna was first elected to Parliament in 2010 - alongside Tristram Hunt and Liz Kendall - before joining the shadow cabinet.Asked about the candidate who might win, Conservative Chancellor George Osborne said: ""The Labour leadership contest has descended into farce.""But it's not actually about personalities. I don't think the Labour Party any more represents the working people of this country who aspire to a better life."""

I'm not suggesting he takes a break from being leader.""Clearly the national executive has the authority, they're the ruling body. ""I'm told that they made a decision. I'm told it was a procedurally correct decision, he is the leader but I think it's important that as leader he takes a break and I think it's important that we work out how these complex questions are answered by a team.""No one person has all the answers. I'm particularly concerned about tone, making sure we get a tone that ensures that the 27 million people who didn't vote for UKIP last week may be persuaded to vote for us in future.""The party has been beset by wrangling since Mr Farage agreed to stay on as leader, days after standing down after failing to get elected in Thanet South.He had pledged before the general election that he would quit the post if he failed to get elected to Parliament.Senior aide Matthew Richardson has left the party, following claims from MEP Patrick O'Flynn that Mr Farage had fallen under the influence of ""inexperienced"" advisers.UKIP has also confirmed the departure of Mr Farage's chief of staff Raheem Kassam.Mr Farage ruled out quitting as leader on BBC's Question Time on Thursday, saying he had ""phenomenal"" support, and has challenged his critics to decide whether they want to stay in the party.In his article, Mr Carswell had said that ""knowing how difficult it is to lead a party makes me admire Nigel Farage all the more"".""I know that I never could,"" he added, stressing that he would find it ""impossible to simultaneously lead UKIP, be the voice of the party in the Commons, represent my Clacton constituents and at the same time be a husband and a dad"".However, he said that ""even leaders need to take a break"", adding: ""Nigel needs to take a break now.""UKIP got nearly four million votes at the election, but returned only one MP - former Conservative Mr Carswell in the Clacton constituency."
2015-05-09,Coasting schools 'must improve',https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/education-32763097,"Education Secretary Nicky Morgan has said new powers to sack head teachers in coasting schools will show ""it is not OK to be just above the level of failing"". Under the plans, ministers could force schools rated as ""requiring improvement"" and missing new government benchmarks to become an academy.Coasting schools have average results which have often flatlined over time.Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, Mrs Morgan said faster action was needed.She said: ""Our big priorities will be to speed up the process for tackling failing schools; extend our academies programme to tackle 'coasting' schools; and deliver on our commitment to open new free schools.""The proposals will be in a new bill due to be introduced in the Queen's Speech. ""First, we will take new powers to step in from the moment that a school is found to be failing,"" Mrs Morgan said.""From day one, regional schools commissioners will be able to bring in new leadership and support from other excellent schools and heads, and we will speed up the process of turning schools into academies to make sure that new expert leadership is found for all schools that need it as quickly as possible.""She said that coasting schools will be put on an immediate notice to improve and could then be taken over and turned into an academy.They will be required to work with a team of ""expert"" head teachers.She said: ""Those that aren't able to demonstrate a clear plan for improvement will be given new leadership - we know this works in turning schools around.""More than 3,300 schools in England are labelled ""requires improvement"", but the plans are unlikely to cover that many schools.Under the current system, secondary schools are considered to be failing, and therefore eligible for intervention, if fewer than 40% of their students score at least five Cs at GCSE, including English and maths, and they do not meet national averages in pupil progress.In primary schools, the threshold for intervention is if fewer than 65% of pupils get Level 4 in reading, writing and maths and a below average number of pupils make the expected amount of progress.It is not yet clear how coasting schools will be deemed in need of intervention.It is understood that a new category will be devised covering schools which are rated as ""requires improvement"" and which fail to meet a new set of standards on improvement."
2015-05-09,Co-op Group to keep political funding,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-32762858,"The Co-operative Group has decided to continue financially supporting the Co-operative Party, which has strong ties to Labour.Members of the group, the UK's biggest mutual organisation, voted on the issue at their annual general meeting.They passed a motion by 48,579 for, to 39,479 against, to approve ""political expenditures"" of up to £1m which support the movement's objectives.Last year the Co-op Group gave £625,000 to the Co-op Party.This figure was down on the sums donated in previous years. The AGM also included a vote on new corporate governance procedures which would mean members having less of a direct say.The Co-operative Group is still recovering from a period of financial mismanagement and some members have recently expressed concerns about how elections to the board are chosen.The banking arm of the group came close to collapse in 2013, bringing the whole group to a £2.5bn annual loss that year. The Co-op Party includes among its members a number of Labour MPs, including shadow chancellor Chris Leslie and Walthamstow MP Stella Creasy. The politicians stand as candidates of both the Co-operative Party and the Labour Party, and the two political movements have strong historical ties. The board asked the members of the Co-operative Group whether they wanted to continue financially supporting the Co-operative Party, or any other party. Allan Leighton, chairman of the Co-op Group, said: ""There's a clear remit from the members to continue to support the Labour Party.""It allows us to now have a conversation with the Co-op Labour Party about what we do next.""There was also a members' motion on the agenda, put forward by those in favour of making political donations of up to £1m a year.The motion to approve political funding ""not to exceed £1m per annum"" was carried by 55.17% to 44.83%.BBC business correspondent Joe Lynam said: ""To meet a £1.5bn hole in its accounts - mostly stemming from its banking division - the Co-op Group has had to sell off parts of its businesses and hand over majority control of its bank to American hedge funds.""It's also in the process of radically changing the way it runs itself into a more corporate structure with less of a direct say by its members.""He said that ""in theory"", each of the 2.8 million Co-op members could vote on a series of motions about the reforms, as well as how its bosses are paid, and retaining the links to the Co-operative party.One of the group's largest independent societies, Midcounties, recently threatened legal action over a shortlist of six candidates for the group's board being reduced to three - the number of positions available - before a member vote.

2015-05-09,Osborne plans July 'stability' Budget,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32761566,"Chancellor George Osborne has said that he will deliver a new Budget on 8 July.He claimed it would have ""a laser-like focus"" on raising productivity and living standards.He said he was making the unusual move of having a second Budget in one year in order to ""deliver on the commitments we have made to working people"".Labour said the chancellor would have to set out ""who is going to pay"" for what it called ""uncosted promises"" in the election campaign.Speaking outside 11 Downing Street, the chancellor gave a broad outline of his plans for the forthcoming Budget but refused to be drawn on the details, including the Conservatives' planned £12bn of welfare cuts.""I don't want to wait to deliver on the commitments we have made to working people,"" he said.""It will continue with the balanced plan we have to deal with our debts, invest in our health service and reform welfare to make work pay.""But there will also be a laser-like focus on making our economy more productive so we raise living standards across our country.""We're going to put Britain into good shape for the long term.""The last Budget was held on 18 March and included tax cuts for first-time house buyers.Writing in the Sun, Mr Osborne admitted it was ""unusual"" to have two Budgets in the same year, but he wanted to turn ""promises made in the election into a reality"".Again, Mr Osborne did not specifically outline how the Conservatives plan to fulfil a pledge to cut £12bn in welfare spending but said he wants to make the welfare system ""fair for the people who pay for it"".He writes: ""We will protect the NHS and give it more funding each and every year, while making savings across Whitehall. ""We'll crack down hard on tax avoidance and aggressive tax planning by the rich - because everyone should pay their fair share.  ""We will always protect the most vulnerable, but we also need a welfare system that's fair to the people who pay for it. If you can work you should be working, so we'll take the next steps in our benefit reforms to make sure that happens.""Second, we've got to go on helping businesses create jobs in Britain, so we move towards full employment. That means facing a hard truth: in Britain we produce about a quarter less for every hour we work than countries like America or Germany. Fixing that long-running productivity weakness is the big challenge for the next five years.""So in the Budget we'll spend less on welfare, and instead invest to create three million more apprenticeships, so that young people can learn a trade, get better jobs and earn more.""After the Budget in March independent forecaster the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said that Mr Osborne needed to spell out exactly how he plans to cut £12bn from welfare spending.Of those £12bn planned cuts, £2bn were outlined ahead of the general election - all the cuts are supposed to be in place by 2017-18.Labour's shadow energy and climate change secretary, Caroline Flint, accused the Tories of making ""a number of uncosted promises"" during the election campaign.She told the BBC: ""It will be interesting to see who is going to pay for those uncosted policies when they bring the Budget in July."""
2015-05-09,Farage should take a break - Carswell,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32761766,"UKIP leader Nigel Farage ""needs to take a break now"", the party's only MP Douglas Carswell has said.Writing in the Times, Mr Carswell said he admired Mr Farage, but questioned his ""ill-advised"" comments about HIV patients, made in a TV leaders' debate.Mr Farage ruled out quitting as leader on BBC's Question Time on Thursday, saying he had ""phenomenal"" support.It follows a bitter internal row within the party, which has seen two of Mr Farage's senior aides resigning.In his article, Mr Carswell said that ""knowing how difficult it is to lead a party makes me admire Nigel Farage all the more"".""I know that I never could,"" he added, stressing that he would find it ""impossible to simultaneously lead UKIP, be the voice of the party in the Commons, represent my Clacton constituents and at the same time be a husband and a dad"".However, he said that ""even leaders need to take a break"", adding: ""Nigel needs to take a break now.""He described Mr Farage as ""inspirational"", saying the party had ""done extraordinarily well"" under his leadership but now needed to ""consider carefully what comes next"".Earlier, Mr Farage challenged his critics to decide whether they wanted him to stay in the party.He said he had ""massive"" support from UKIP MEPs, donors and party members to continue in the role, suggesting one person, whom he did not name, was ""agitating for change"".Addressing the prospect of a future EU referendum, Mr Carswell said: ""All of us UKIP supporters should ask one question; Is what I'm doing at this moment making an 'out' vote more likely? If it isn't, stop it and do something else.""He also criticised Mr Farage's comments about HIV patients during the TV leaders' debate last month.While debating about the NHS, Mr Farage said: ""You can come into Britain from anywhere in the world and get diagnosed with HIV and get the retro-viral drugs that cost up to £25,000 per year per patient.""Mr Carswell wrote: ""By all means we should highlight the problem of health tourism. But we need to admit that using the example of HIV patients to make the point was ill-advised.""He said the party needed to strike ""the right tone"" and added: ""UKIP has been at its most persuasive when we have been most optimistic.""Anger is never a great way to motivate people - at least not for very long.""The party has been beset by wrangling since Mr Farage agreed to stay on as leader, days after standing down after failing to get elected in Thanet South.He had pledged before the general election that he would quit the post if he failed to get elected to Parliament.Matthew Richardson has left the party, following claims from MEP Patrick O'Flynn that Mr Farage had fallen under the influence of ""inexperienced"" advisers. UKIP has also confirmed the departure of Mr Farage's chief of staff Raheem Kassam.UKIP got nearly four million votes at the election, but returned only one MP - former Conservative Mr Carswell in the Clacton constituency."
2015-05-09,Tributes as ex-Conservative MP dies,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-northamptonshire-32764540,"Tributes have been paid to former Conservative MP Sir Peter Fry who has died at the age of 83.Sir Peter, who had been ill for a year, was MP for Wellingborough and Rushden, in Northamptonshire, for 28 years from 1969 until his defeat by Labour in 1997.In government he was notable as an expert on transport issues.Current Wellingborough Conservative MP Peter Bone said Sir Peter remained ""extremely well thought of"".""When I was canvassing in the last election, people were still talking about him. They absolutely loved how he helped them and he was a highly-regarded local MP,"" Mr Bone said.""He stood up for what was right rather than what the party line was. In those days - the John Major years - it was much more difficult to stand up against the party machine. He had strong views on Europe.""Sir Peter started his career as an insurance broker, joining the Wycombe Young Conservatives in 1949 and the Oxford University Conservative Association in 1951.He went on to become a Conservative councillor on Buckinghamshire County Council between 1961 and 1967.Wellingborough mayor-elect Barry Graves also paid tribute to Sir Peter, remembering him as a ""very strong constituency MP"".""I remember going out and canvassing with him and he would go everywhere. He knew the area and the people. He was very much a man of the local constituency.""He was ""a very approachable man"", Mr Graves added.Sir Peter was knighted in 1994. "

2015-05-09,PM will 'look at' powers proposals,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32746049,"David Cameron has said he would ""look at"" any proposals for further powers for Scotland but wants to get the Smith Commission plans implemented first.The prime minister was speaking after meeting Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon in Edinburgh.Mr Cameron said he made a ""commitment"" to include a devolution bill in the Queen's Speech later this month.Ms Sturgeon argued the Smith Commission proposals were ""a good starting point"" but did not go far enough.The prime minister has pledged to include a bill on devolution in this month's Queen's Speech which would be based on the cross-party Smith Commission agreement. The Smith proposals included giving Holyrood the power to set income tax rates and bands, as well as control over a share of VAT and some welfare benefits. But Ms Sturgeon's SNP also wants the Scottish Parliament to be given powers over business taxes, employment law, the minimum wage and additional powers over welfare.Speaking after meeting Ms Sturgeon, Mr Cameron told the BBC: ""Let's make sure Smith is implemented in full. I'm going to keep the commitment I made to the people of Scotland. Let's get that done first because it does create a really strong Scottish Parliament.""He added: ""Of course, if people want to make future proposals I'll look at them.""The prime minister again said he did not support full fiscal autonomy for Scotland - the responsibility for all areas of tax and spending except defence and foreign affairs - stating that it would mean £7bn of cuts or extra tax-raising.What Nicola Sturgeon is trying to say is she has a mandate. She has 56 out of the 59 MPs elected in Scotland and she won 50% of the vote - unprecedented here in Scotland.She says that gives her leverage to push David Cameron. David Cameron says he wants to keep the nation together.The language coming out of Westminster last week was very much a cordial one. 'We will listen'.Nicola Sturgeon has warned him that if he doesn't listen, then the people of Scotland will judge him accordingly.Ms  Sturgeon described the hour-long talks at her official residence at Bute House as ""constructive and business-like"". She said Mr Cameron had made a ""commitment"" that the Smith proposals would be implemented ""as agreed"".""But secondly the prime minister agreed that he would look at proposals that we would now send to suggest the areas we can go beyond Smith,"" Ms Sturgeon said.""There was no agreement in terms of the substance of that but we will submit those proposals, the prime minister has said they will consider them and there will be a meeting to look at how we take that further forward.""Referring to her party's success in last week's general election, which saw the SNP win 56 out of 59 Scottish seats, Ms Sturgeon said: ""People in Scotland have now voted fairly convincingly for the SNP and sent a message that we want the Smith Commission proposals to go further and be built on.""The ball is in his court but I'm going into this in good faith.""She added: ""David Cameron and I are a world apart politically but, where we can, I'm determined to do business in the interests of the people of Scotland and across the UK.""She said she would have a ""constructive and business-like"" relationship with the prime minister. The two leaders shook hands on the front steps of Bute House as Mr Cameron arrived. Mr Cameron left the building shortly before 11:00, almost an hour after he had arrived.The two sides agreed to hold more regular discussions in the future, possibly quarterly. "
2015-05-09,Umunna withdraws Labour leader bid,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32748106,"Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna has withdrawn from the Labour party leadership contest, just days after throwing his hat into the ring.The MP, 36, said in a statement that he was not comfortable with the level of pressure and scrutiny that came with being a leadership candidate.Mr Umunna also cited concerns about the impact of the bid on his family.BBC political editor Nick Robinson said the MP's team insisted no ""unwelcome press story"" lay behind the move.But Mr Umunna had been shocked by the level of scrutiny of himself, his mother, sister and girlfriend, he said.You can follow the latest reaction here.A rising star of the party, Mr Umunna was first elected to Parliament in 2010 before joining the shadow cabinet.He confirmed his candidacy for the Labour leadership via a post on his Facebook page on 12 May, saying the party under Ed Miliband had failed to appeal to enough voters in England.But on Friday he said he had not found the leadership bid to be ""a comfortable experience"".I understand that Chuka Umunna has told friends that ""this is not right for me or people close to me. I'm human, the rest of my life is more important to me than politics.""The shadow business secretary has been distressed by the degree of scrutiny he, his family and his girlfriend have come under since he declared his intention to stand for the labour leadership.I am told that this includes reporters waiting outside the houses of relatives late at night.Friends of Mr Umunna deny that he is nervous of not getting the support of enough MPs to run for the leadership; they point out that he already has half the necessary names and that there are some weeks to go.The shadow business secretary now wants to play a leading role in arguing that Britain should stay in the EU and does not rule out seeking the leadership in the future.He said he thought he had understood ""the scrutiny and attention a leadership contest would bring"", but added: ""However, since the night of our defeat last week I have been subject to the added level of pressure that comes with being a leadership candidate.""The shadow business secretary said he had wondered if it was too soon for him to stand for the leadership, and ""I fear it was."" He also cited concerns about the impact on ""the rest of one's life"" and those close to him.""Consequently, after further reflection, I am withdrawing my candidacy,"" he said.Mr Umunna said he would continue to serve as shadow business secretary and hoped to ""play a leading role"" in Labour's campaign to keep the UK in the EU during the forthcoming in/out referendum.Commenting on the news, Labour former culture secretary Ben Bradshaw - who is expected to run for deputy leader - said Mr Umunna was a ""terrible loss"" to the field.He told the BBC's Daily Politics the Streatham MP had been the candidate the Conservative Party ""feared the most"".""And if it's the result of pressure on an extended family or an extended group of friends, I think that's a very sad reflection on our political culture,"" he said.Chuka Umunna feels ""liberated"", he told me, by his decision to quit the Labour leadership race.He hopes to be given a good role (shadow chancellor, I wonder?) by whoever becomes Labour leader. And I expect he'll become very high profile in the campaign to keep Britain in Europe, which is increasingly looking like it will be next May.He'll endorse a candidate in the next four weeks before nominations close. It will be very interesting to see who he piles in behind.Read more from Allegra (see post 13.23).Former Labour leader Lord Kinnock said he thought Mr Umunna had made the right decision.He said: ""If he felt in his soul that he wasn't prepared to subject himself - and more importantly his family - to the kind of attention which is fairly typical, sadly, these days, he has done absolutely the right thing.""There is no point at all in inflicting avoidable, unnecessary misery on those you love most.""Leadership contender Mary Creagh said she had ""huge respect"" for Mr Umunna, telling BBC Radio 4's World at One programme it took ""courage"" to withdraw from the leadership race.Mr Umunna was ""a big beast"" and would play a ""big role"" in the future of the Labour Party, she added.Yvette Cooper, Andy Burnham, Liz Kendall and Mary Creagh have already thrown their hats into the ring for Labour's top job while a number of other potential candidates, including Dan Jarvis, Alan Johnson and David Lammy, have ruled themselves out. Candidates must secure nominations from 34 colleagues - 15% of the party's MPs - by 15 June to make it on to ballot papers, which will be sent to members in August ahead of the leader's election a month later."

However, Mr Justice Stuart Smith at Southwark Crown Court said there was a ""very strong likelihood"" a custodial sentence would follow.The jury heard how Mote submitted numerous false expenses claims for payment for work that organisations had allegedly carried out on his behalf.Mote claimed the money was to pay whistleblowers in cash through third parties. He also said he had been ""targeted for being an anti-EU MEP.""During his time an MEP he also made £250,000 legitimate expenses claims.No date has been set for the sentencing."

2015-05-09,Round-up: BBC experts' analysis,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/election-2015-32650417,"The political future of the United Kingdom has become clearer after the results of the general election emerged around the country.David Cameron says he hopes to govern for all of the UK after the Conservatives took 331 seats - enough to form a slender majority in the Commons.Labour has been all but wiped out by the SNP in Scotland and suffered a disappointing set of results elsewhere, while the Lib Dems are left with just eight MPs after many party heavyweights such as Vince Cable and Danny Alexander lost their seats.So with battles won and lost and the fall-out and celebrations beginning, BBC correspondents examine the implications and challenges that lie ahead for the new government - and for those whose political careers have been ended by voters.No pollster, no pundit, no political leader saw it coming - not even David Cameron himself.Governing parties don't gain seats. Parties that have implemented painful cuts and are promising more certainly don't. Until that is the Conservative Party did - achieving what had seemed to be Mission Impossible - a Tory majority.Until that is David Cameron's personal triumph which triggered the near simultaneous resignation of his three principle opponents - Messrs Miliband, Clegg and Farage.They did so in part because they helped to crush their partners in coalition these last five years - reducing the Liberal Democrat parliamentary party to a size when it can fit into two London taxis and still have two seats to spare.In part because the extraordinary tidal wave of support for the SNP swept dozens of once safe Labour seats away.In part because Nigel Farage persuaded millions to vote for him but secured just one seat - not, though, the one he was standing in.Read more from Nick Robinson hereThe question uppermost in the prime minister's mind as he assembles his new government is how to keep the kingdom united.""Above all I want to bring our country together,"" he revealed after the result, ""to reclaim a mantle we should never have lost - the mantle of one nation, one United Kingdom"".Looking at the political landscape from Land's End today is very different to the view from John O'Groats.A sea of Conservative and Unionist blue dominates the scene across much of England, while a field of SNP nationalist yellow stretches to the horizon and beyond from the north.David Cameron's greatest challenge is to prevent the union he supports being torn apart by mutual resentment - resentment from Scotland at a Westminster government dominated by English Tories, and resentment from England at the preferential treatment people think is being given to the Scots.Those who assumed the future of the Union had been safeguarded by the Scottish referendum must think again.Read more from Mark Easton hereOne thing is rock-solid true: the Conservatives who worked on this campaign are as surprised by the result as the pollsters, pundits, politicians and general population.Maybe they shouldn't be - the economy is in good shape and the Conservatives had incumbency advantage.But when I travelled back from the prime minister's last rally with a group of exhausted Conservative campaign officials it was clear that 290 seats was a hoped-for target.No-one talked about anything over 300 seats, and no-one even mentioned an overall majority.So what special sauce pushed David Cameron into No 10 with a Commons majority?Mr Cameron had two simple messages in the campaign and he rarely veered away from them; the first - the economy is in good shape and the recovery is threatened by Labour. And the second - the SNP would hold a Labour-led government to ransom.Read more from Jonny Dymond hereBrian Taylor, BBC political editor, ScotlandOf all the comments on the overnight apocalypse, undoubtedly the most straightforward came from a defeated Scottish Labour MP.Since there were quite a few of them, let me narrow the focus a little. Come on down, Tom Harris.Mr Harris had plainly anticipated defeat. Nonetheless, he looked suitably lugubrious as his fate was confirmed.Why, he was asked eagerly, had Labour lost? ""Because we did not win enough votes.""Psephologically, it is perfect. Complete in itself. Psychologically, it sums up Labour's gloom without descending into subsidiary matters such as leadership, strategy and the rest. As a forward-thinking strategy, it is ideal. Win more votes. Simple.Read more from Brian Taylor hereThis has been an election which may have more profound consequences than almost any in living memory.We now face a generational decision about our future in Europe, with an EU referendum in two years' time almost certain.There will also be serious questions about the future of the Union, following an SNP landslide that has turned Scotland into a virtual one-party state.David Cameron's victory also represents a colossal achievement.Only once before in recent history has an incumbent government increased its majority - and that was Mrs Thatcher in her prime in the 1980s.It is also a significant personal victory for Mr Cameron and a rebuff for those in his party who had become increasingly sceptical about his ability to win.But while it may represent a defeat for those Tories who saw this election as a potential opportunity to rid themselves of David Cameron, he must now govern with a wafer-thin majority.For the SNP, their stunning victory can only increase the pressure on Nicola Sturgeon to include a commitment to a second independence referendum in her party's manifesto for next year's Scottish elections.It is an election which has not just defied all the predictions of the pollsters and pundits - but which may yet prompt the most fundamental re-casting of British politics for a generation.Read more from Norman Smith hereAfter an extraordinary night, some brief conclusions:Read more from James Landale hereIs this the end of the union?That is the question many people will be asking this morning after the party which has fought for Scottish independence for 80 years swept to victory.The answer from the jubilant Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon is a firm ""No"".She insists that her MPs will speak for all of Scotland, not just for the 45% who voted for the country to leave the United Kingdom last September.In the closing hours of the most extraordinary election campaign which anyone in Scotland can remember, Ms Sturgeon turned to talk of ""legitimacy.""That will be her watchword in the coming days as she argues that the prime minister cannot ignore the democratic will of the Scottish people.Politically, Scotland and England this morning look and feel like very different countries.Read more from James Cook hereAfter weeks of chatter about an election too close to call, it wasn't that close at all.David Cameron will be continuing as our prime minister.So, what is all this likely to mean?A referendum on whether the UK stays in, or leaves, the European Union, within the next two-and-a-half years.A race to be the next leader of the Labour Party.A race to be the next leader of the Liberal Democrats.And a huge new presence of Scottish National Party MPs at Westminster.And so here's another thing we know for certain this morning: Politics ain't going to be boring any time soon.Read more from Chris Mason hereFor Labour the story of their terrible night is rapidly turning into the search for a new leader. So who will that be?Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, is almost certain to run.  Even before this election, both he and another almost inevitable candidate, Chuka Umunna, had raised eyebrows inside the party at the work they had put in, preparing the ground with members and the unions for potential bids.Yvette Cooper, before the election, was still thought not to have made up her mind over whether to run. That decision has been made perhaps a little easier as her husband, Ed Balls, has lost his seat.She is certainly potentially in the frame, along with two lesser known names - Liz Kendall and Dan Jarvis - two MPs who were only elected in 2010 for the first time. This could be their moment. But whoever is in the job, they face a monumental task.Read Laura Kuenssberg's Twitter hereSterling is up (the most for seven years against the euro), share prices are up (especially bank shares like Lloyds and RBS, and energy shares such as Centrica), government bond prices are up.To state the obvious, investors love the Tories' general election victory.There are a few reasons.One (no surprise here) is that Labour's threat of breaking up banks and imposing energy price caps has been lifted.Second is that investors have been discounting days and weeks of wrangling after polling day over who would form the government - and so they are semi-euphoric that we already know who's in charge.Third, many investors tend to be economically conservative and instinctively Conservative.But although the City may be a bit drunk on the result, its pleasure in Ed Miliband's and Ed Balls' humiliation may be making it a bit blind - perhaps dangerously so - to some bumps in the economic road ahead.Read more from Robert Peston hereNigel Farage dreamed of holding the balance of power, but in the end his UKIP party is now worse off than when it came into the election.At the seventh time of asking he was rejected - this time by the people of Thanet South. It was a similar story in Rochester and Strood where Mark Reckless, who sensationally defected from the Tories last year, was also sent packing.In seats on UKIP's target list, like Thurrock in Essex, the party failed to make gains. In Grimsby - where Mr Farage went twice in the last six weeks - they came third.UKIP got around four million votes - with especially strong showings in north-east and south-east England - but it's ended up with just one MP, and a vacancy at the top. This has led to UKIP attacking the current system of choosing MPs, which it's described as ""busted"" and ""dysfunctional"".In one sense, this campaign was a complete failure and it's left an aftermath of angry voters, and others wondering if the UKIP bubble has burst.Read Robin Brant's Twitter hereI monitored 91 GB-wide voting intention polls during the 2015 election campaign and found nothing in them to prepare me for the final outcome.The good news for the pollsters was that their share for the Lib Dems was pretty close, as were the shares for UKIP, the Greens and the catch-all category of Others.The bad news for the polling industry was that the crucial shares for Conservative and Labour were the ones where they came most adrift.When all the qualifications of margins of error are allowed, there did appear to be a systematic overstatement of the Labour share and an equally systematic understatement of the Conservative one.It is for the pollsters to decide whether to conduct a review of their performance but I trust they will avoid the initial knee-jerk reaction of the immediate aftermath of the 1992 polls debacle.This general election performance follows the performance of the polls in the 2014 Scottish referendum where the choice was simply binary and yet all the polls were out by between 4-6%.Something is wrong. A lot of us would like to know what it is.Read more from David Cowling hereThe words ""political earthquake"" have been translated into numerous European languages, making front page news across the continent.While Britons now examine the domestic minutiae of the election result, here in mainland Europe the vote means one thing: a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU. And that has the potential to create an earthquake of its own.The guardian of the EU treaties Mr Cameron wants to change - Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker - has said again he'd listen to what Britain's new government proposed.Read more from Katya Adler here"

2015-05-09,A history of political plots,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32749971,"Nigel Farage has apparently seen off a challenge to his leadership of UKIP - a move described by his former election strategist as a ""coup"". He's not the only party leader to face an attempted ousting. But can you recover from such a revolt?In 2006, the Labour prime minister was the target of what became known as the ""curry house conspiracy"" - a coup to remove him and install his chancellor, Gordon Brown, as prime minister.It would lead to several of the plotters' resignations - but not Mr Blair's. However, it was successful to a degree in that it forced the party leader into naming a departure date.The move against him was reportedly masterminded by Tom Watson, a defence minister at the time, who was also rumoured to have had a secret meeting with Mr Brown on the eve of the revolt.Apparently, Mr Watson and three fellow West Midlands MPs - Sion Simon, David Wright (both ministerial aides) and Khalid Mahmood - met over a biryani at a Wolverhampton curry house to discuss the PM's future, before dispatching a missive calling for him to quit.The letter - which attracted the support of a number of normally loyal Labour MPs - was leaked to the press, and ultimately resulted in Mr Watson's resignation.In his parting letter, the West Bromwich East MP took a shot at the prime minister, who he said should step down in the interests of party and country.Mr Blair denounced his actions and branded the former minister ""disloyal, discourteous and wrong"", saying he would have sacked him if he had not resigned.But Mr Watson's departure was swiftly followed by the resignations of six other junior members of government - who had also signed the rebel letter - in protest at the prime minister's refusal to say when he would step down as Labour leader.The whole affair resulted in Mr Blair announcing his intention to step aside within 12 months - which he duly did, on 27 June 2007.But it did nothing to quash internal dissent and speculation in the party over the future leadership of the party.Labour prime minister Gordon Brown found his leadership under threat in 2009 after one of his cabinet ministers dramatically quit the government and called for him to resign.Work and Pensions Secretary James Purnell - a former aide to Tony Blair - resigned from his post after the polls closed in the local and European elections, in which Labour was forecast to do badly.Explaining his decision to quit, Mr Purnell said the prime minister made a Conservative victory ""more, not less, likely"".It was Mr Brown's first direct challenge from a cabinet minister - but it would not topple the Labour leader as senior members of government refused to follow Mr Purnell's lead.Mr Brown was safe for the time being. But several months later, in January 2010, a fresh leadership challenge was mounted by two senior former Labour cabinet ministers.Geoff Hoon and Patricia Hewitt wrote to all Labour MPs, saying the party was ""deeply divided"" over Mr Brown's leadership and that the best way to resolve the issue was by way of secret ballot.They insisted it was not an ""attempted coup"" but a necessary step to resolve divisions within the party.But the duo could only muster the public support of a handful of backbenchers long-opposed to Mr Brown, with the majority of the party's MPs less than impressed by the move, which came just weeks before the general election.As the day wore on, a succession of cabinet ministers came out to back the PM, suggesting there was little momentum behind the plot - although it was noted that several were not exactly gushing in their support of Mr Brown.As history tells us, neither leadership challenge bore fruit but they reflected the internal doubts and divisions over Mr Brown at the helm.As leadership toppling attempts go, this one in 2014 was regarded as a particularly ""botched"" and ""shambolic coup"". Indeed, former Lib Dem leader Lord (Paddy) Ashdown described the move as a ""plot of deep malice"".Its instigator, Lord (Matthew) Oakeshott - a close ally of the-then Business Secretary Vince Cable - tried to unseat Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg.The peer was found to have commissioned secret polls suggesting the party would do better at the 2015 general election without Mr Clegg in the driving seat.The man Lord Oakeshott had long had in mind to take Mr Clegg's place - Mr Cable, who was on government business in China at the time - was forced to publicly condemn his friend's actions and state his backing for Mr Clegg.But Lord Oakeshott said the business secretary had in fact known about his polls and their findings.Nevertheless, the peer - who was denounced by the Lib Dem leadership for spending money that could have been spent on campaigning - quit the party, and issued a warning shot on his way out about the Lib Dems' future prospects.Mr Cable largely emerged unscathed but he faced questions about his loyalty to the leader. Although the two sought to put paid to reports of a rift with a (painfully awkward, 'nothing to see here, folks') stage-managed pint in a pub.Although the revolt failed, and Mr Clegg remained at the helm, the Lib Dems did go on to suffer a trouncing at the general election, losing nearly 50 of its MPs - one of them, Mr Cable himself - prompting his leader to quit.The Conservatives have a reputation for being more ruthless than their party rivals when it comes to getting rid of leaders they sense are no longer effectual.But, in 1995, Prime Minister John Major - tired of persistent rumours of a leadership challenge - decided to take the bull by the horns and trigger a surprise leadership election to silence his detractors.His own backbenchers had questioned Mr Major's ability to unite and lead the party, which was deeply divided over Europe.So ""put up or shut up"", he told them as he tendered his resignation as Conservative Party leader but not prime minister.But then stepped forward eurosceptic MP John Redwood, who resigned from the cabinet in order to contest Mr Major's leadership.This was unexpected by many, as the PM had said there had been assurances from his cabinet that none would stand against him.But Mr Major went on to win the ensuing election with a comfortable defeat over his challenger, who was not included in the PM's consequent cabinet reshuffle.No further contested leadership election took place until after the Conservatives' defeat at the 1997 general election, paving the way for William Hague to take over the running of the party.Not all attempts to oust a party leader end in failure: as Margaret Thatcher found out to her peril.With three electoral victories under her belt, the Conservative prime minister's downfall would come at the hands of her own party - not the voters.It was on 1 November 1990 when Geoffrey (now Lord) Howe - one of Mrs Thatcher's longest-serving ministers - resigned over differences with the party leader over Europe.In his now infamous speech on the floor of the House of Commons, he attacked the PM's policies and leadership style, comparing being one of her cabinet ministers to opening the batting at cricket only to find his bat had been ""broken... by the team captain"".It sparked the beginning of the end of the 11-year Thatcher reign.Michael (now Lord) Heseltine seized on the opportunity to challenge the prime minister in the ensuing leadership contest, from which she would eventually withdraw and John Major emerge as her successor. Reflecting on the revolt and its implications on the Conservative Party, Baroness Thatcher's biographer Charles Moore wrote: ""Because the coup was unjustified, and so trust broke down, the politics of the next 15 years were those of civil war."""
2015-05-09,Election swings and roundabouts,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-32741924,"If election manifesto claims are all about smoke and mirrors, should we now add swings and roundabouts to the political metaphor?There's an intriguing aspect to the general election results in the Midlands that puzzled me.It's the striking contrast in the swings between Labour and the Conservatives.David Cameron and his campaign strategists knew they were home and dry when Nuneaton was the first Midlands marginal to declare.It was not only a Tory hold but a swing to the Conservatives from Labour of 3%.I was in the Nottingham suburb of Beeston awaiting the result of the Broxtowe count. Would its high profile Conservative MP Anna Soubry survive a red surge?Nuneaton set the pattern. Across the Midlands, both east and west, there was a uniform swing of between three and four per cent to the Tories - Warwickshire North 3%, Amber Valley 4%, Derbyshire South 4% and Sherwood 4%. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan topped the Tory swingometer in the Midlands marginals with 5% in Loughborough.Yet in the big cities, it was a very different story. The swing went to Labour.So in Nottingham East they enjoyed a 6% swing, Nottingham South 5.8%, Leicester South 7.3%, Leicester West 5%, Birmingham Hall Green 12%, Birmingham Hodge Hill 8%.If swings to Labour on this scale had gone beyond the city ring road roundabouts and into the suburbs, Ed Miliband would have become prime minister by now.In confidence, one senior Labour insider in Nottingham told me its success in the city wards was down to organisation, experience and its teams of activists.""We won the ground war. If Nottingham's city boundaries were extended into Sherwood and Broxtowe, we would have won those constituencies as well,"" he told me.Labour leadership candidate, Leicester West's Liz Kendall has identified her party's problem beyond the ring road roundabout.It's about reaching out to Middle England.""We need to show people that we understand their aspirations and ambitions for the future,"" she told the Sunday Times.The problem for Labour was that Middle England was not interested in what the party offered…and still isn't. The Cameron brand worked its magic in those Midlands marginals... it'll take something or someone special to break up that ballot box relationship."
2015-05-09,Royal 'lobbying',https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32740154,"Prince Charles sent 27 letters to then Prime Minister Tony Blair and members of his government between September 2004 and March 2005, ""despite the Freedom of Information Act!"" as the prince joked in one.But did his suggestions and concerns have any bearing on the behaviour of Mr Blair's government?The request: Prince Charles expresses his worries over an EU directive on complementary medicines ""which is… effectively outlawing the use of certain herbal extracts"".  Mr Blair replied, offering moral support and practical help. He agreed that ""the implementation as it is currently planned is crazy"" and set out an action plan that included delaying implementation for all existing products to 2011. What happened: Herbal products were not required to be authorised until 2011, just as Mr Blair had promised. Prince Charles continues to sell his own brand of complementary products, Duchy Herbals, through Boots and Waitrose. The request: Writing to Mr Blair, the prince expresses a ""growing sense of anxiety"" that the Hill Farming Allowance, which supports farmers working on Britain's uplands, could be scrapped. In his reply, the prime minister said he understood that the Hill Farm Allowance would continue until 2007. What happened: The allowance lasted until the end of Labour's tenure in 2010, when it was abolished.The request: Just 18 months after the US-led invasion of Iraq, Prince Charles raised the issue of poor performance of Lynx helicopters in high temperatures, saying: ""I fear that this is just one more example of where our Armed Forces are being asked to do an extremely challenging job (particularly in Iraq) without the necessary resources.""Mr Blair replied: ""On the subject of the Lynx helicopter, the limitations of the existing platform, particularly in the extremely challenging environment within Iraq, are well recognised by the Ministry of Defence."" He added that replacement of the helicopters would be a priority. What happened: Mr Blair's comments go much further than what he was saying about the subject at the time. In the event, though, the fleet was not fully upgraded until 2011.The request: Prince Charles lamented that the government's TB prevention plans might not ""include a commitment to deal with the badger problem in the immediate future"" and pushed strongly for a cull, saying: ""All I can say is that I do urge you to look again at introducing a proper cull of badgers where it is necessary.""Mr Blair sympathised, saying he could ""personally see the case for culling badgers"". However, he was unwilling to commit to a cull.  What happened: Culling trials were conducted from 1998-2005. The final results, published in 2008, said that the badger cull could ""make no meaningful contribution"" to curbing bovine TB. It wasn't until 2013 that a full culling programme began in two pilot areas. These ended with the conclusion that the pilots had been neither humane nor effective at curbing the spread of TB.The request: Then Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell wrote to Prince Charles to say she had decided to give parts of the historic Smithfield meat market Grade II listed status, and was trying to persuade deputy prime minister John Prescott to ""call in"" the planning application to prevent demolition of other parts of the site. She had been swayed by evidence provided by Sir Neil Cossons, who was English Heritage chair at the time, after he had been asked by the prince to add his support. Prince Charles replied that he was ""extremely glad to read of your appreciation of the value of this group of buildings"". According to the Guardian, market workers desperate to see the redevelopment of the site invited the prince to meet them to discuss it, but his office said he was ""unlikely to accept as he did not want to interfere in the planning process"".What happened: Smithfield market is still the subject of planning battles a decade on. Successive planning applications have been refused by ministers. Last year then Communities Secretary Eric Pickles rejected plans for an office development on the site, stating that ""the extent of damage that the application would cause to the important heritage assets at Smithfield runs entirely counter to national and policy objectives intended to protect such assets from harm"".In March, the Museum of London announced a move from its current Barbican site to the Smithfield market building."
2015-05-09,Election fallout,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32703139,"""Some of those gimmicks - that tombstone, whatever idiot thought that up I do not know!""I was talking to the former Mayor of Crawley in Sussex, John Mortimer, in the town's Labour Supporters Club about the vexed question of what went wrong, and where Labour should go next. This seat is one of those southern seats Labour hoped to take, but failed.I hear a whole range of views in the club.""They didn't give nothing to depend on, they should be clear, and a little bit more down to Earth."" ""Good party, wrong leader, they don't look after business enough.""Councillor John Stanley tells me: ""I think in a way we did go too left, but now we can go a bit centre-left, or centre, depending who the new leader is.""The former mayor sums up the mood on the doorstep: ""Whatever we told them, they didn't believe us.""  Expect to hear all those views, and more, in the coming leadership contest. Step back from the angst of supporters, and it may not be that hard to see why Labour failed.  An economic recovery, hailed by independent organisations as the result of government policy, undid a party that had loudly proclaimed for five years that the coalition's policies would lead to economic disaster. Combine that with an uncharismatic and uninspirational leader, then you might argue no further debate is necessary.Fat chance of that. Defeat breeds resentment, and this one has opened up old divisions.  A chorus of Blairties, led by the man himself, has declared that Ed's problem was ignoring those with aspiration and ambition, failing to appeal to those running business. Incidentally, I've been ticked off by the perspicacious editor of the New Statesman, Jason Cowley, for using the ""unhelpful"" term ""Blairites"".I can't think of another description that fits Tony, Lord Mandelson, Lord Adonis and David Miliband quite so well. But call them what you will, the message was clear - Ed was too left wing, Labour should move back to the centre, or, if you like, to the right.Reading Mr Blair's pithy analysis, listening to Lord Mandelson's gripping and savage eloquence, describing a party sent out to shout: ""We love the poor and hate the rich,"" and so ignoring the middle, and you realise strong emotions are in play.But back to the future may not be sufficient. Of course elections are won on the centre ground. But grandees grinding axes, affronted by the failure of boys who used to make their tea, may be creating so much noise that they can't hear more insistent sounds.  For there are several elephants trumpeting loudly as they cram into the small space of the shadow cabinet room. Imagine these beasts are as gaily decorated as Berlin buddy bears. One is decked out in red, another in imperial purple bunting, and another, a mammoth, strong tusked and ice rimmed, painted yellow with tartan trimmings.Take the last first. The Scottish wipeout is Labour's biggest problem. Fail to solve it, and Labour can forget ever having a comfortable majority again. It is hard to argue Labour were wiped out in Scotland because the SNP outflanked them to the right with their appeal to the business community and the ambitious and aspirational. But it is true the SNP drew in to people from left, right and centre, just as the modernisers say Labour should. It was the politics of economic self-interest, but cast in a very different light. Tribally sneering at ""the reactionary ideology of nationalism"" as Mr Blair does, will not reach the central belt of Scotland, the middle ground of  Midlothian.What about that purple pachyderm?  In Crawley - in fact in seat after seat - there is a similar pattern.  Labour did, in fact, often increase the size of their vote. So did the Conservatives, usually by a bit more. But the real dynamic was the total collapse of the Lib Dems and the dramatic rise of UKIP. The increase in votes for Nigel Farage's party wasn't translated into parliamentary seats, but, although it is early days in terms of research, it probably hurt Labour a lot. If we believe - and I do - Matthew Goodwin and Rob Ford, authors of Revolt on the Right, these voters are often former Labour supporters - older, less educated, those left behind on the tides of  globalisation, stranded on the shores of post-industrialisation. They may have had too many disappointments to feel much ambition or aspiration. They are a challenge for Labour, and any new leader will spend a good deal of time thinking how to deal with the concerns of Europe and immigration.Whether to share their fears, or confront them will be a big decision.Which brings us to Red Nellie. Those members who still proudly call themselves socialist. This is not about Old Labour - they are more likely to be baristas or barristers than boilermakers. It is easy as an outsider, as a journalist, to treat politics as an intellectual game about how best to win power - but many people, particularly the foot soldiers, particularly after the death of  purely tribal loyalties, are in it because they passionately believe in winning  power to do something specific.Many of them are suspicious of the later incarnations of New Labour, not because it reached an accommodation with wealth and business, but because it seemed to worship at the same altar, to regard the party's core beliefs in redistribution and equality as childish fantasies from a past age.Perhaps to Mr Blair, they are the problem, people who may equate ""ambition"" with greed. They might point out that a man who claims to be worth ""only"" £20m may find it harder than most to squeeze through the eye of a needle to understand their point of view. Most successful Labour leaders will confront the left at some point, but the concerns of this group go to the existential question ""What is the party for?""This is not a polemic - not an argument about what should be done, but a reflection on the complex conundrums that will face any new Labour leader, the tearing apart of the old alliance that made up a Labour majority, and so the political need to satisfy groups with very different, indeed, contradictory demands. But looking for a Social Democratic universal theory of everything may be missing the point. What the party desperately wants is a leader who can pull the disparate threads together and articulate them as common purpose. Whether she or he exists is another matter.Much more on that in the coming months."
2015-05-09,'Take us with you',https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-32736153,"Thousands of people in the north of England have been using the hashtag ""take us with you Scotland"" to express their upset about the result of last week's general election, and Scottish nationalists are welcoming this English minority with open arms. Last Thursday's general election was a rough one for the Labour Party in its traditional stronghold in the north of England. But further to the north, the left-leaning Scottish National Party won nearly every seat it contested. That political contrast has made some left-wing voters in places like Manchester, Leeds and Sheffield look fondly on their neighbours. Since last Thursday's election in Britain the phrase ""take us with you Scotland"" has been used more than 24,000 times. ""Genuinely beginning to wonder if the North of England becoming a part of Scotland would be better for us, I really am,"" tweeted Aaron Miller from Yorkshire. Some cracked jokes under the tag after the North West Motorway Police account, which gives traffic updates, announced that they had ""picked up a pedestrian on the M62 who was trying to walk to Scotland.""After an initial spike of jokes over the weekend, the hashtag really took off when users start to mobilise in support of around a year-old petition on the campaigning site Change.org. The petition calls for the north of England to secede from the rest of the country and join up with Scotland, and more than 12,000 people have signed it.Its creator, a Sheffield resident who calls himself ""Stu Dent"", set it up to coincide with last year's Scottish independence referendum, and he also created a map imagining the boundary of a ""Scotland plus the north"" country.Stu Dent runs the Twitter account Hunters Bar, named after an area of southwest Sheffield which is very popular with - you guessed it - students. Despite the account having thousands of followers on Twitter, when the map was first posted last year, the image was shared only about 100 times - however, in the past week it's been retweeted by thousands. Stu Dent told BBC Trending that he was surprised at how popular his idea has become. ""In hindsight, perhaps I shouldn't have been,"" he said. ""There is a huge frustration in parts of the UK about the things that have happened since 2010.""""I think people need a place to go where they can say 'not in my name! This is not the England I want',"" he added. But in addition to disappointment from some quarters about the election result, there might be another reason why the petition is getting a boost now: the power of the Scottish Nationalists on Twitter. What started as a post-election joke in the North of England was quickly embraced by the so-called ""Cyber Nats"" - and a trend was born.The SNP's social media strategist Ross Colquhoun expressed the party's mood about the hashtag best, in a post which was shared more than 500 times. ""2014: #LetsStayTogether 2015: #TakeUsWithYouScotland What a difference a year makes"" he tweeted.Blog by Hannah HendersonNext story: The sport reporter and the obscene ranter who lost his jobFollow BBC Trending on Twitter @BBCtrending, and find us on Facebook."
2015-05-09,What Britain wants from Europe,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32695399,"David Cameron says he has a mandate to pursue EU reform following the Conservatives' general election victory. The PM, who will be hoping his majority government will give him extra leverage in Brussels, wants to renegotiate the terms of the UK's membership ahead of a referendum by the end of 2017. He has said he will campaign for Britain to remain in the EU if he gets the reforms he wants.Mr Cameron has said he does not want to reveal full details of his negotiating hand but he has given a broad indication, in a series of speeches and newspaper articles, of his priorities when he goes into talks with other EU leaders.These are: The prime minister has said Britain would resist any move towards a European Army and that he wants to free British police forces from EU interference. He has also ruled out Britain joining the euro.But he has placed less emphasis in recent years on demanding changes to EU social policy, such as the maximum 48-hour working week, agency workers, maternity leave and non-discrimination rules.The official UK government position is that a referendum will be held by the end of 2017 but Downing Street sources have said: ""If we can do it earlier we will.""There is speculation David Cameron is planning to hold the vote in 2016 to avoid a clash with French and German elections in 2017.The prime minister wants treaty change but even if the referendum was held in 2017 there may not be enough time to legally incorporate any reforms into a treaty and it would have to be done at a later stage.An early referendum would anger Eurosceptics who believe it would not allow enough time to make the case for exit or negotiate any meaningful concessions.""A rushed process would severely undermine the chances to secure a significant deal that both British business and voters could support and would waste the opportunity of a lifetime,"" Matthew Elliott, chief executive of Business for Britain told Breitbart London.The question is always crucial in any referendum and there is already a debate about what it should be. The Draft European Union (Referendum) Bill, published by the Conservatives in 2013, proposed this form of words: ""Do you think that the United Kingdom should remain a member of the European Union?""Some thought that leaned too far towards the status quo, encouraging a yes vote, and the Electoral Commission said it was not clear and direct enough. The watchdog proposed this form of words instead: ""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union?""The new Conservative government will attempt to repeal the Human Rights Act, which requires UK courts to treat the European Court of Human Rights as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. The European Court of Human Rights is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe (CoE), which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine.The freedom for people to move around Europe, enshrined in the EU treaties, works in parallel with the other three basic freedoms in the single market: freedom of goods, capital and services.It is likely to be a ""red line"" for other EU leaders, who do not want to see it eroded.Mr Cameron has steered clear of tackling it directly - for example by asking for an emergency ""brake"" on free movement, or a cap on numbers - focusing instead on reducing the incentive provided by welfare payments. In a speech last November, David Cameron set out measures to reduce the number of EU nationals moving to the UK.His main proposals were:Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission, has said he is ready to work with Mr Cameron to ""strike a fair deal for the United Kingdom in the EU"". The leaders of other EU nations have previously warned they are unlikely to support major changes to EU treaties to accommodate British demands. But Mr Cameron's general election victory may have given him extra leverage. ""The ball is very much in the court of the UK now,"" a senior EU official told The Guardian. ""It's up to the British to define what they want."" The key figure will be German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is very keen to keep Britain in the EU but has so far been unwilling to make major concessions to enable that to happen. There are fears that a ""pick and mix"" approach to EU treaties would undermine EU cohesion.Mr Cameron has said there is ""no doubt"" his planned reforms will require changes to the treaties governing the European Union. But this would require the unanimous support of all EU members, and may not be possible within the deadline he has set of a referendum before the end of 2017. Any attempt to change EU laws on free movement would meet fierce resistance from some EU nations, particularly Eastern European states. Mr Juncker has said free movement is non-negotiable.Mr Cameron may find it difficult to get unanimous support for his proposals for a four-year waiting period for migrant workers claiming UK benefits. East European EU members would be likely to oppose this, on the grounds that it would discriminate against their citizens.  Attempts to secure opt-outs for the City are unlikely to go down well with other European leaders.However, there are precedents for EU treaty changes to accommodate some countries' specific concerns - for example, the protocol attached to the Lisbon Treaty for Ireland.Mr Cameron has faced repeated calls to say whether he would campaign for Britain's exit from the EU in the referendum if he fails to get what he wants from the renegotiation process. All he has said is that he will ""rule nothing out"". Some Conservative MPs want Britain to leave the EU no matter what David Cameron manages to renegotiate. A larger group are likely to want more concessions than Mr Cameron has so far indicated he is prepared to demand.Senior backbencher David Davis, who was defeated by Mr Cameron for the Tory leadership in 2005, told the Daily Telegraph the majority of the 332 Conservative MPs want Mr Cameron to negotiate an ""opt-out"" power to stop individual EU laws from applying to Britain. The prime minister has said this would be ""impossible"" without Britain leaving the EU.Mr Davis claims as many as 60 Tory MPs would be prepared to rebel and vote for Britain's exit from the EU if the prime minister fails to deliver.Graham Brady, chairman of the Tory backbench 1922 committee, which represents backbenchers, has urged David Cameron to give all Conservative MPs, including ministers, a free vote in the EU referendum.In January, Mr Cameron warned that serving cabinet ministers would have to quit the government if they wanted to campaign to leave the EU if he had secured the reforms to it he wants.In the 1975 referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Economic Community, as the EU was then called, Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson decided to suspend collective responsibility because his cabinet was split on the issue. Ministers were allowed to vote with their consciences and campaign against each other. The majority of them, including Mr Wilson, joined the Yes camp, but left-wingers, such as Tony Benn, played a leading role in the No campaign. The Yes campaign won easily with 67% of the vote."

2015-05-10,Scots Labour leader Murphy to resign,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32760196,"Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy is to resign next month, he has announced.It comes despite Mr Murphy narrowly surviving a vote of no confidence at a meeting of the party's national executive in Glasgow. Mr Murphy said he would tender his resignation alongside a plan to reform the party.He lost his seat in last week's general election as the SNP won 56 of the 59 Scottish seats, leaving Labour with a single MP in Scotland.Mr Murphy said he wanted to have a successor as leader in place by the summer, and confirmed he would not be standing for a seat at the Scottish Parliament in next year's election. Instead, he said it was time to ""do something else"" and that he believed the party would continue to be divided if he remained as leader. His deputy, Kezia Dugdale MSP, will become acting leader until a permanent successor is found. Mr Murphy had faced calls to resign from several MSPs, trade unions and former MPs in the wake of his party's near wipeout at the general election.He insisted he had decided to stand down ahead of the national executive voting by 17-14 in favour of him staying in the job.Speaking at a media conference after the national executive meeting, he said: ""It is clear that a small minority who didn't accept my election as leader of the Scottish Labour Party just five months ago won't accept the vote of the executive today and that will continue to divide the party.""Today I received more support in the executive vote than I did from members of the executive when I stood for election five months ago.""He said it would be up to the executive whether to accept the reforms he would be proposing before he left the post. But he warned: ""A party in such urgent need of reform blocks those changes at its peril.""The former East Renfrewshire MP said Labour had been crushed between ""two nationalisms"" in Scotland and England.Mr Murphy said he left no legacy of bitterness for anyone in the Labour Party, and the only person he was angry at was the person who blamed Scottish Labour for the party's UK-wide general election defeat - a reference to Unite leader Len McCluskey.And he said that in many ways Scottish Labour was the ""least modernised part of the Labour movement"" and that he wanted his successor to be elected under a one member, one vote system.Mr Murphy added: ""The Labour Party's problem is not the link with trade unions, or even the relationship with Unite members - far from it. It is the destructive behaviour of one high profile trade unionist.""The leader of the Scottish Labour Party doesn't serve at the grace of Len McCluskey, and the next leader of the UK Labour Party should not be picked by Len McCluskey.""Mr McCluskey has been a vocal critic of Mr Murphy's leadership and opposed his appointment in December when Mr Murphy won the contest to replace Johann Lamont.Jim Murphy laughed and joked with Scottish Labour's sole MP as he made his way down the hotel corridor to announce his resignation.He certainly brought energy and dynamism to his election campaign - but all that achieved was Ian Murray in Edinburgh South.So as Mr Murphy bows out, who could replace him?The deputy leader Kezia Dugdale may want to step up or Neil Findlay could try again after challenging last time. Maybe the party's finance spokeswoman Jackie Baillie thinks her steady hand could steer the ship.Jenny Marra is also often talked about as future face of the party.Whoever steps into Jim Murphy's red shoes he or she will have to face a difficult 2016 Holyrood election, to put it mildly.There are also more fundamental questions about how the party can possibly move on as it faces a surging SNP.Mr Murphy was very much a creature of ""New Labour"" - but to today's generation that's old Labour.Party members may start looking for someone with no links to the past, neither a Brownite nor a Blairite. A 'cleanskin' - as the politicos put it - may well help re-connect with voters.That's a long way from now though - even some of the party's opponents may view this latest train wreck with a modicum of sympathy. Ms Lamont had resigned after claiming Scottish Labour was treated like a ""branch office"" by the London-based party leadership.Mr Murphy concluded his speech by saying: ""Scotland needs a strong Labour party; Scotland needs a united Labour party. We have been the greatest force for change in our nation's remarkable history. ""The Scottish Labour party will rise again. It will be under someone else's leadership and I am confident about my party's future.""Harriet Harman MP, acting leader of the UK Labour Party, said it would be for Scottish Labour to choose a new leader. She added: ""As a cabinet minister and leader of his party in Scotland, Jim has been a hugely important figure in the Labour Party. He leaves with the best wishes and thanks of our movement.""Labour peer Lord McConnell, a former Scottish first minister, said the party's problems were ""much deeper than one individual and one affiliate"".He said: ""We have a disconnect locally and nationally with wider Scottish society. ""We have a problem with our political positioning in the post devolution age where the party particularly at the UK level has never been comfortable with success in the Scottish parliament and has always tried to see things through a UK prism rather than a Scottish prism.""We need to find a new generation, a new leader, new generation, new ideas, a fresh approach.""In a tweet, Scottish first minister and SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said: ""I wish Jim Murphy all the very best for the future. Leadership is not easy and he deserves credit for standing up for what he believes in.""Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson also reacted on Twitter, saying: ""Jim Murphy announces a managed exit in order to help the party, which is to his credit. But leaves a tough gig for whoever comes next.""The meeting of Scottish Labour's executive was disrupted by protesters who entered the party's headquarters.Police were called and the protesters, who included persistent anti-austerity activists Sean Clerkin and Piers Doughty-Brown, left the building to protest further from the street outside.The protesters were calling for Mr Murphy to remain as leader to ""finish the job of destroying Scottish Labour"".A Police Scotland spokeswoman said officers had been called and found two protestors on the third floor of the building. She added: ""Both left on police arrival. Advice and assistance was given."""
2015-05-10,Labour contenders clash on spending,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32761561,"Prospective Labour leaders have clashed over Labour's record in government in their first public debate in the race to succeed Ed Miliband.Former cabinet ministers including Yvette Cooper and Andy Burnham defended Labour's fiscal record and spending on schools and hospitals.However, candidates from the 2010 intake of MPs argued that the party spent too much while in office.The debate followed Chuka Umunna's withdrawal from the leadership contest.The remaining candidates appeared at the annual conference of the Progress think tank in London.There was agreement that Labour needed to demonstrate economic credibility to regain power, with shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt telling the meeting that the party needed to be ""trusted with public finances and the family finances"".Mr Hunt, who was first elected to Parliament in 2010 when Labour lost power, argued the last Labour government ""spent too much"" and failed to ""leave enough economic headroom to deal with the economic crisis and the recession"".Shadow health minister Liz Kendall said: ""There's absolutely nothing progressive about spending more on debt interest payments than on educating our children.""But shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: ""The Tories have had a triumph of spin over the facts in saying what they said about the economic record of the last Labour government.""The former chief secretary to the Treasury said the deficit did ""grow too large"" in the government's later years but insisted: ""The last Labour government ran more surpluses in its first term than the Tories did in 18 years.""Yvette Cooper, another former chief secretary to the Treasury, said: ""We should never let anybody tell us that it was too many teachers, doctors or nurses that caused Lehman Brothers bank in New York to crash.""Shadow international development secretary Mary Creagh said: ""People have forgotten the economic credibility that the last Labour government had.""She said Labour had built schools and hospitals that were ""treasured in our communities"".Ms Cooper, Mr Burnham, Ms Kendall and Ms Creagh have declared their intention to run for leader, while Mr Hunt told the conference he would make an announcement next week.At the same event, shadow energy secretary Caroline Flint announced she would be running for deputy leader.The Don Valley MP told the Today programme ahead of the debate that Labour lost the election because ""fundamentally the public did not trust us on the economy"".Exeter MP Ben Bradshaw has already announced a bid to be deputy, saying Labour ""must and could win the next election"", but only if it ""broadens its appeal by adopting sensible, centre-left politics which celebrate wealth creation and entrepreneurship"".Former Labour campaign co-ordinator Tom Watson is reported to be crowd-funding a deputy leadership bid, while Walthamstow MP Stella Creasy has said she is ""open to the question"" of running.Barnsley East MP and shadow transport secretary Michael Dugher - a fierce critic of Ed Miliband's election campaign - is to run Mr Burnham's campaign, according to the website LabourList.It is reported that Mr Burnham also has the backing of Labour peer Lord Falconer, who was lord chancellor and justice secretary under Tony Blair and was close to the former PM.Shadow culture secretary Chris Bryant has signalled his backing for Ms Cooper, tweeting that the next leader must be ""someone who's been tried in the fiery furnace of public opinion"".Mr Hunt said on Friday he would be be attending the debate - along with the other four hopefuls - to ""set out my analysis on how we begin to understand what went so wrong and why"".He added: ""We must use this leadership election to ask some very profound questions.""All voices in the party must be heard so that we can have a full and proper assessment as to why the politics of nationalism triumphed in Scotland and huge swathes of England, and how we have allowed the Conservative Party to present a more compelling vision for Britain to so many millions of people.""Speculation still surrounds shadow business secretary Mr Umunna's decision to pull out on Friday, when he said he was not ""comfortable"" with the ""pressure"" of being a candidate.As well as citing extensive pressure and scrutiny Mr Umunna also said he was ruling himself out because of concerns about the impact of the bid on his family.A rising star of the party, Mr Umunna was first elected to Parliament in 2010 - alongside Tristram Hunt and Liz Kendall - before joining the shadow cabinet.Asked about the candidate who might win, Conservative Chancellor George Osborne said: ""The Labour leadership contest has descended into farce.""But it's not actually about personalities. I don't think the Labour Party any more represents the working people of this country who aspire to a better life."""

I'm not suggesting he takes a break from being leader.""Clearly the national executive has the authority, they're the ruling body. ""I'm told that they made a decision. I'm told it was a procedurally correct decision, he is the leader but I think it's important that as leader he takes a break and I think it's important that we work out how these complex questions are answered by a team.""No one person has all the answers. I'm particularly concerned about tone, making sure we get a tone that ensures that the 27 million people who didn't vote for UKIP last week may be persuaded to vote for us in future.""The party has been beset by wrangling since Mr Farage agreed to stay on as leader, days after standing down after failing to get elected in Thanet South.He had pledged before the general election that he would quit the post if he failed to get elected to Parliament.Senior aide Matthew Richardson has left the party, following claims from MEP Patrick O'Flynn that Mr Farage had fallen under the influence of ""inexperienced"" advisers.UKIP has also confirmed the departure of Mr Farage's chief of staff Raheem Kassam.Mr Farage ruled out quitting as leader on BBC's Question Time on Thursday, saying he had ""phenomenal"" support, and has challenged his critics to decide whether they want to stay in the party.In his article, Mr Carswell had said that ""knowing how difficult it is to lead a party makes me admire Nigel Farage all the more"".""I know that I never could,"" he added, stressing that he would find it ""impossible to simultaneously lead UKIP, be the voice of the party in the Commons, represent my Clacton constituents and at the same time be a husband and a dad"".However, he said that ""even leaders need to take a break"", adding: ""Nigel needs to take a break now.""UKIP got nearly four million votes at the election, but returned only one MP - former Conservative Mr Carswell in the Clacton constituency."
2015-05-10,Coasting schools 'must improve',https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/education-32763097,"Education Secretary Nicky Morgan has said new powers to sack head teachers in coasting schools will show ""it is not OK to be just above the level of failing"". Under the plans, ministers could force schools rated as ""requiring improvement"" and missing new government benchmarks to become an academy.Coasting schools have average results which have often flatlined over time.Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, Mrs Morgan said faster action was needed.She said: ""Our big priorities will be to speed up the process for tackling failing schools; extend our academies programme to tackle 'coasting' schools; and deliver on our commitment to open new free schools.""The proposals will be in a new bill due to be introduced in the Queen's Speech. ""First, we will take new powers to step in from the moment that a school is found to be failing,"" Mrs Morgan said.""From day one, regional schools commissioners will be able to bring in new leadership and support from other excellent schools and heads, and we will speed up the process of turning schools into academies to make sure that new expert leadership is found for all schools that need it as quickly as possible.""She said that coasting schools will be put on an immediate notice to improve and could then be taken over and turned into an academy.They will be required to work with a team of ""expert"" head teachers.She said: ""Those that aren't able to demonstrate a clear plan for improvement will be given new leadership - we know this works in turning schools around.""More than 3,300 schools in England are labelled ""requires improvement"", but the plans are unlikely to cover that many schools.Under the current system, secondary schools are considered to be failing, and therefore eligible for intervention, if fewer than 40% of their students score at least five Cs at GCSE, including English and maths, and they do not meet national averages in pupil progress.In primary schools, the threshold for intervention is if fewer than 65% of pupils get Level 4 in reading, writing and maths and a below average number of pupils make the expected amount of progress.It is not yet clear how coasting schools will be deemed in need of intervention.It is understood that a new category will be devised covering schools which are rated as ""requires improvement"" and which fail to meet a new set of standards on improvement."
2015-05-10,Co-op Group to keep political funding,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-32762858,"The Co-operative Group has decided to continue financially supporting the Co-operative Party, which has strong ties to Labour.Members of the group, the UK's biggest mutual organisation, voted on the issue at their annual general meeting.They passed a motion by 48,579 for, to 39,479 against, to approve ""political expenditures"" of up to £1m which support the movement's objectives.Last year the Co-op Group gave £625,000 to the Co-op Party.This figure was down on the sums donated in previous years. The AGM also included a vote on new corporate governance procedures which would mean members having less of a direct say.The Co-operative Group is still recovering from a period of financial mismanagement and some members have recently expressed concerns about how elections to the board are chosen.The banking arm of the group came close to collapse in 2013, bringing the whole group to a £2.5bn annual loss that year. The Co-op Party includes among its members a number of Labour MPs, including shadow chancellor Chris Leslie and Walthamstow MP Stella Creasy. The politicians stand as candidates of both the Co-operative Party and the Labour Party, and the two political movements have strong historical ties. The board asked the members of the Co-operative Group whether they wanted to continue financially supporting the Co-operative Party, or any other party. Allan Leighton, chairman of the Co-op Group, said: ""There's a clear remit from the members to continue to support the Labour Party.""It allows us to now have a conversation with the Co-op Labour Party about what we do next.""There was also a members' motion on the agenda, put forward by those in favour of making political donations of up to £1m a year.The motion to approve political funding ""not to exceed £1m per annum"" was carried by 55.17% to 44.83%.BBC business correspondent Joe Lynam said: ""To meet a £1.5bn hole in its accounts - mostly stemming from its banking division - the Co-op Group has had to sell off parts of its businesses and hand over majority control of its bank to American hedge funds.""It's also in the process of radically changing the way it runs itself into a more corporate structure with less of a direct say by its members.""He said that ""in theory"", each of the 2.8 million Co-op members could vote on a series of motions about the reforms, as well as how its bosses are paid, and retaining the links to the Co-operative party.One of the group's largest independent societies, Midcounties, recently threatened legal action over a shortlist of six candidates for the group's board being reduced to three - the number of positions available - before a member vote.

2015-05-10,Osborne plans July 'stability' Budget,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32761566,"Chancellor George Osborne has said that he will deliver a new Budget on 8 July.He claimed it would have ""a laser-like focus"" on raising productivity and living standards.He said he was making the unusual move of having a second Budget in one year in order to ""deliver on the commitments we have made to working people"".Labour said the chancellor would have to set out ""who is going to pay"" for what it called ""uncosted promises"" in the election campaign.Speaking outside 11 Downing Street, the chancellor gave a broad outline of his plans for the forthcoming Budget but refused to be drawn on the details, including the Conservatives' planned £12bn of welfare cuts.""I don't want to wait to deliver on the commitments we have made to working people,"" he said.""It will continue with the balanced plan we have to deal with our debts, invest in our health service and reform welfare to make work pay.""But there will also be a laser-like focus on making our economy more productive so we raise living standards across our country.""We're going to put Britain into good shape for the long term.""The last Budget was held on 18 March and included tax cuts for first-time house buyers.Writing in the Sun, Mr Osborne admitted it was ""unusual"" to have two Budgets in the same year, but he wanted to turn ""promises made in the election into a reality"".Again, Mr Osborne did not specifically outline how the Conservatives plan to fulfil a pledge to cut £12bn in welfare spending but said he wants to make the welfare system ""fair for the people who pay for it"".He writes: ""We will protect the NHS and give it more funding each and every year, while making savings across Whitehall. ""We'll crack down hard on tax avoidance and aggressive tax planning by the rich - because everyone should pay their fair share.  ""We will always protect the most vulnerable, but we also need a welfare system that's fair to the people who pay for it. If you can work you should be working, so we'll take the next steps in our benefit reforms to make sure that happens.""Second, we've got to go on helping businesses create jobs in Britain, so we move towards full employment. That means facing a hard truth: in Britain we produce about a quarter less for every hour we work than countries like America or Germany. Fixing that long-running productivity weakness is the big challenge for the next five years.""So in the Budget we'll spend less on welfare, and instead invest to create three million more apprenticeships, so that young people can learn a trade, get better jobs and earn more.""After the Budget in March independent forecaster the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said that Mr Osborne needed to spell out exactly how he plans to cut £12bn from welfare spending.Of those £12bn planned cuts, £2bn were outlined ahead of the general election - all the cuts are supposed to be in place by 2017-18.Labour's shadow energy and climate change secretary, Caroline Flint, accused the Tories of making ""a number of uncosted promises"" during the election campaign.She told the BBC: ""It will be interesting to see who is going to pay for those uncosted policies when they bring the Budget in July."""

If it isn't, stop it and do something else.""He also criticised Mr Farage's comments about HIV patients during the TV leaders' debate last month.While debating about the NHS, Mr Farage said: ""You can come into Britain from anywhere in the world and get diagnosed with HIV and get the retro-viral drugs that cost up to £25,000 per year per patient.""Mr Carswell wrote: ""By all means we should highlight the problem of health tourism. But we need to admit that using the example of HIV patients to make the point was ill-advised.""He said the party needed to strike ""the right tone"" and added: ""UKIP has been at its most persuasive when we have been most optimistic.""Anger is never a great way to motivate people - at least not for very long.""The party has been beset by wrangling since Mr Farage agreed to stay on as leader, days after standing down after failing to get elected in Thanet South.He had pledged before the general election that he would quit the post if he failed to get elected to Parliament.Matthew Richardson has left the party, following claims from MEP Patrick O'Flynn that Mr Farage had fallen under the influence of ""inexperienced"" advisers.

They absolutely loved how he helped them and he was a highly-regarded local MP,"" Mr Bone said.""He stood up for what was right rather than what the party line was. In those days - the John Major years - it was much more difficult to stand up against the party machine. He had strong views on Europe.""Sir Peter started his career as an insurance broker, joining the Wycombe Young Conservatives in 1949 and the Oxford University Conservative Association in 1951.He went on to become a Conservative councillor on Buckinghamshire County Council between 1961 and 1967.Wellingborough mayor-elect Barry Graves also paid tribute to Sir Peter, remembering him as a ""very strong constituency MP"".""I remember going out and canvassing with him and he would go everywhere. He knew the area and the people. He was very much a man of the local constituency.""He was ""a very approachable man"", Mr Graves added.Sir Peter was knighted in 1994. "

2015-05-10,PM will 'look at' powers proposals,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32746049,"David Cameron has said he would ""look at"" any proposals for further powers for Scotland but wants to get the Smith Commission plans implemented first.The prime minister was speaking after meeting Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon in Edinburgh.Mr Cameron said he made a ""commitment"" to include a devolution bill in the Queen's Speech later this month.Ms Sturgeon argued the Smith Commission proposals were ""a good starting point"" but did not go far enough.The prime minister has pledged to include a bill on devolution in this month's Queen's Speech which would be based on the cross-party Smith Commission agreement. The Smith proposals included giving Holyrood the power to set income tax rates and bands, as well as control over a share of VAT and some welfare benefits. But Ms Sturgeon's SNP also wants the Scottish Parliament to be given powers over business taxes, employment law, the minimum wage and additional powers over welfare.Speaking after meeting Ms Sturgeon, Mr Cameron told the BBC: ""Let's make sure Smith is implemented in full. I'm going to keep the commitment I made to the people of Scotland. Let's get that done first because it does create a really strong Scottish Parliament.""He added: ""Of course, if people want to make future proposals I'll look at them.""The prime minister again said he did not support full fiscal autonomy for Scotland - the responsibility for all areas of tax and spending except defence and foreign affairs - stating that it would mean £7bn of cuts or extra tax-raising.What Nicola Sturgeon is trying to say is she has a mandate. She has 56 out of the 59 MPs elected in Scotland and she won 50% of the vote - unprecedented here in Scotland.She says that gives her leverage to push David Cameron. David Cameron says he wants to keep the nation together.The language coming out of Westminster last week was very much a cordial one. 'We will listen'.Nicola Sturgeon has warned him that if he doesn't listen, then the people of Scotland will judge him accordingly.Ms  Sturgeon described the hour-long talks at her official residence at Bute House as ""constructive and business-like"". She said Mr Cameron had made a ""commitment"" that the Smith proposals would be implemented ""as agreed"".""But secondly the prime minister agreed that he would look at proposals that we would now send to suggest the areas we can go beyond Smith,"" Ms Sturgeon said.""There was no agreement in terms of the substance of that but we will submit those proposals, the prime minister has said they will consider them and there will be a meeting to look at how we take that further forward.""Referring to her party's success in last week's general election, which saw the SNP win 56 out of 59 Scottish seats, Ms Sturgeon said: ""People in Scotland have now voted fairly convincingly for the SNP and sent a message that we want the Smith Commission proposals to go further and be built on.""The ball is in his court but I'm going into this in good faith.""She added: ""David Cameron and I are a world apart politically but, where we can, I'm determined to do business in the interests of the people of Scotland and across the UK.""She said she would have a ""constructive and business-like"" relationship with the prime minister. The two leaders shook hands on the front steps of Bute House as Mr Cameron arrived. Mr Cameron left the building shortly before 11:00, almost an hour after he had arrived.The two sides agreed to hold more regular discussions in the future, possibly quarterly. "
2015-05-10,Umunna withdraws Labour leader bid,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32748106,"Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna has withdrawn from the Labour party leadership contest, just days after throwing his hat into the ring.The MP, 36, said in a statement that he was not comfortable with the level of pressure and scrutiny that came with being a leadership candidate.Mr Umunna also cited concerns about the impact of the bid on his family.BBC political editor Nick Robinson said the MP's team insisted no ""unwelcome press story"" lay behind the move.But Mr Umunna had been shocked by the level of scrutiny of himself, his mother, sister and girlfriend, he said.You can follow the latest reaction here.A rising star of the party, Mr Umunna was first elected to Parliament in 2010 before joining the shadow cabinet.He confirmed his candidacy for the Labour leadership via a post on his Facebook page on 12 May, saying the party under Ed Miliband had failed to appeal to enough voters in England.But on Friday he said he had not found the leadership bid to be ""a comfortable experience"".I understand that Chuka Umunna has told friends that ""this is not right for me or people close to me. I'm human, the rest of my life is more important to me than politics.""The shadow business secretary has been distressed by the degree of scrutiny he, his family and his girlfriend have come under since he declared his intention to stand for the labour leadership.I am told that this includes reporters waiting outside the houses of relatives late at night.Friends of Mr Umunna deny that he is nervous of not getting the support of enough MPs to run for the leadership; they point out that he already has half the necessary names and that there are some weeks to go.The shadow business secretary now wants to play a leading role in arguing that Britain should stay in the EU and does not rule out seeking the leadership in the future.He said he thought he had understood ""the scrutiny and attention a leadership contest would bring"", but added: ""However, since the night of our defeat last week I have been subject to the added level of pressure that comes with being a leadership candidate.""The shadow business secretary said he had wondered if it was too soon for him to stand for the leadership, and ""I fear it was."" He also cited concerns about the impact on ""the rest of one's life"" and those close to him.""Consequently, after further reflection, I am withdrawing my candidacy,"" he said.Mr Umunna said he would continue to serve as shadow business secretary and hoped to ""play a leading role"" in Labour's campaign to keep the UK in the EU during the forthcoming in/out referendum.Commenting on the news, Labour former culture secretary Ben Bradshaw - who is expected to run for deputy leader - said Mr Umunna was a ""terrible loss"" to the field.He told the BBC's Daily Politics the Streatham MP had been the candidate the Conservative Party ""feared the most"".""And if it's the result of pressure on an extended family or an extended group of friends, I think that's a very sad reflection on our political culture,"" he said.Chuka Umunna feels ""liberated"", he told me, by his decision to quit the Labour leadership race.He hopes to be given a good role (shadow chancellor, I wonder?) by whoever becomes Labour leader. And I expect he'll become very high profile in the campaign to keep Britain in Europe, which is increasingly looking like it will be next May.He'll endorse a candidate in the next four weeks before nominations close. It will be very interesting to see who he piles in behind.Read more from Allegra (see post 13.23).Former Labour leader Lord Kinnock said he thought Mr Umunna had made the right decision.He said: ""If he felt in his soul that he wasn't prepared to subject himself - and more importantly his family - to the kind of attention which is fairly typical, sadly, these days, he has done absolutely the right thing.""There is no point at all in inflicting avoidable, unnecessary misery on those you love most.""Leadership contender Mary Creagh said she had ""huge respect"" for Mr Umunna, telling BBC Radio 4's World at One programme it took ""courage"" to withdraw from the leadership race.Mr Umunna was ""a big beast"" and would play a ""big role"" in the future of the Labour Party, she added.Yvette Cooper, Andy Burnham, Liz Kendall and Mary Creagh have already thrown their hats into the ring for Labour's top job while a number of other potential candidates, including Dan Jarvis, Alan Johnson and David Lammy, have ruled themselves out. Candidates must secure nominations from 34 colleagues - 15% of the party's MPs - by 15 June to make it on to ballot papers, which will be sent to members in August ahead of the leader's election a month later."

However, Mr Justice Stuart Smith at Southwark Crown Court said there was a ""very strong likelihood"" a custodial sentence would follow.The jury heard how Mote submitted numerous false expenses claims for payment for work that organisations had allegedly carried out on his behalf.Mote claimed the money was to pay whistleblowers in cash through third parties. He also said he had been ""targeted for being an anti-EU MEP.""During his time an MEP he also made £250,000 legitimate expenses claims.No date has been set for the sentencing."

2015-05-10,Round-up: BBC experts' analysis,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/election-2015-32650417,"The political future of the United Kingdom has become clearer after the results of the general election emerged around the country.David Cameron says he hopes to govern for all of the UK after the Conservatives took 331 seats - enough to form a slender majority in the Commons.Labour has been all but wiped out by the SNP in Scotland and suffered a disappointing set of results elsewhere, while the Lib Dems are left with just eight MPs after many party heavyweights such as Vince Cable and Danny Alexander lost their seats.So with battles won and lost and the fall-out and celebrations beginning, BBC correspondents examine the implications and challenges that lie ahead for the new government - and for those whose political careers have been ended by voters.No pollster, no pundit, no political leader saw it coming - not even David Cameron himself.Governing parties don't gain seats. Parties that have implemented painful cuts and are promising more certainly don't. Until that is the Conservative Party did - achieving what had seemed to be Mission Impossible - a Tory majority.Until that is David Cameron's personal triumph which triggered the near simultaneous resignation of his three principle opponents - Messrs Miliband, Clegg and Farage.They did so in part because they helped to crush their partners in coalition these last five years - reducing the Liberal Democrat parliamentary party to a size when it can fit into two London taxis and still have two seats to spare.In part because the extraordinary tidal wave of support for the SNP swept dozens of once safe Labour seats away.In part because Nigel Farage persuaded millions to vote for him but secured just one seat - not, though, the one he was standing in.Read more from Nick Robinson hereThe question uppermost in the prime minister's mind as he assembles his new government is how to keep the kingdom united.""Above all I want to bring our country together,"" he revealed after the result, ""to reclaim a mantle we should never have lost - the mantle of one nation, one United Kingdom"".Looking at the political landscape from Land's End today is very different to the view from John O'Groats.A sea of Conservative and Unionist blue dominates the scene across much of England, while a field of SNP nationalist yellow stretches to the horizon and beyond from the north.David Cameron's greatest challenge is to prevent the union he supports being torn apart by mutual resentment - resentment from Scotland at a Westminster government dominated by English Tories, and resentment from England at the preferential treatment people think is being given to the Scots.Those who assumed the future of the Union had been safeguarded by the Scottish referendum must think again.Read more from Mark Easton hereOne thing is rock-solid true: the Conservatives who worked on this campaign are as surprised by the result as the pollsters, pundits, politicians and general population.Maybe they shouldn't be - the economy is in good shape and the Conservatives had incumbency advantage.But when I travelled back from the prime minister's last rally with a group of exhausted Conservative campaign officials it was clear that 290 seats was a hoped-for target.No-one talked about anything over 300 seats, and no-one even mentioned an overall majority.So what special sauce pushed David Cameron into No 10 with a Commons majority?Mr Cameron had two simple messages in the campaign and he rarely veered away from them; the first - the economy is in good shape and the recovery is threatened by Labour. And the second - the SNP would hold a Labour-led government to ransom.Read more from Jonny Dymond hereBrian Taylor, BBC political editor, ScotlandOf all the comments on the overnight apocalypse, undoubtedly the most straightforward came from a defeated Scottish Labour MP.Since there were quite a few of them, let me narrow the focus a little. Come on down, Tom Harris.Mr Harris had plainly anticipated defeat. Nonetheless, he looked suitably lugubrious as his fate was confirmed.Why, he was asked eagerly, had Labour lost? ""Because we did not win enough votes.""Psephologically, it is perfect. Complete in itself. Psychologically, it sums up Labour's gloom without descending into subsidiary matters such as leadership, strategy and the rest. As a forward-thinking strategy, it is ideal. Win more votes. Simple.Read more from Brian Taylor hereThis has been an election which may have more profound consequences than almost any in living memory.We now face a generational decision about our future in Europe, with an EU referendum in two years' time almost certain.There will also be serious questions about the future of the Union, following an SNP landslide that has turned Scotland into a virtual one-party state.David Cameron's victory also represents a colossal achievement.Only once before in recent history has an incumbent government increased its majority - and that was Mrs Thatcher in her prime in the 1980s.It is also a significant personal victory for Mr Cameron and a rebuff for those in his party who had become increasingly sceptical about his ability to win.But while it may represent a defeat for those Tories who saw this election as a potential opportunity to rid themselves of David Cameron, he must now govern with a wafer-thin majority.For the SNP, their stunning victory can only increase the pressure on Nicola Sturgeon to include a commitment to a second independence referendum in her party's manifesto for next year's Scottish elections.It is an election which has not just defied all the predictions of the pollsters and pundits - but which may yet prompt the most fundamental re-casting of British politics for a generation.Read more from Norman Smith hereAfter an extraordinary night, some brief conclusions:Read more from James Landale hereIs this the end of the union?That is the question many people will be asking this morning after the party which has fought for Scottish independence for 80 years swept to victory.The answer from the jubilant Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon is a firm ""No"".She insists that her MPs will speak for all of Scotland, not just for the 45% who voted for the country to leave the United Kingdom last September.In the closing hours of the most extraordinary election campaign which anyone in Scotland can remember, Ms Sturgeon turned to talk of ""legitimacy.""That will be her watchword in the coming days as she argues that the prime minister cannot ignore the democratic will of the Scottish people.Politically, Scotland and England this morning look and feel like very different countries.Read more from James Cook hereAfter weeks of chatter about an election too close to call, it wasn't that close at all.David Cameron will be continuing as our prime minister.So, what is all this likely to mean?A referendum on whether the UK stays in, or leaves, the European Union, within the next two-and-a-half years.A race to be the next leader of the Labour Party.A race to be the next leader of the Liberal Democrats.And a huge new presence of Scottish National Party MPs at Westminster.And so here's another thing we know for certain this morning: Politics ain't going to be boring any time soon.Read more from Chris Mason hereFor Labour the story of their terrible night is rapidly turning into the search for a new leader. So who will that be?Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, is almost certain to run.  Even before this election, both he and another almost inevitable candidate, Chuka Umunna, had raised eyebrows inside the party at the work they had put in, preparing the ground with members and the unions for potential bids.Yvette Cooper, before the election, was still thought not to have made up her mind over whether to run. That decision has been made perhaps a little easier as her husband, Ed Balls, has lost his seat.She is certainly potentially in the frame, along with two lesser known names - Liz Kendall and Dan Jarvis - two MPs who were only elected in 2010 for the first time. This could be their moment. But whoever is in the job, they face a monumental task.Read Laura Kuenssberg's Twitter hereSterling is up (the most for seven years against the euro), share prices are up (especially bank shares like Lloyds and RBS, and energy shares such as Centrica), government bond prices are up.To state the obvious, investors love the Tories' general election victory.There are a few reasons.One (no surprise here) is that Labour's threat of breaking up banks and imposing energy price caps has been lifted.Second is that investors have been discounting days and weeks of wrangling after polling day over who would form the government - and so they are semi-euphoric that we already know who's in charge.Third, many investors tend to be economically conservative and instinctively Conservative.But although the City may be a bit drunk on the result, its pleasure in Ed Miliband's and Ed Balls' humiliation may be making it a bit blind - perhaps dangerously so - to some bumps in the economic road ahead.Read more from Robert Peston hereNigel Farage dreamed of holding the balance of power, but in the end his UKIP party is now worse off than when it came into the election.At the seventh time of asking he was rejected - this time by the people of Thanet South. It was a similar story in Rochester and Strood where Mark Reckless, who sensationally defected from the Tories last year, was also sent packing.In seats on UKIP's target list, like Thurrock in Essex, the party failed to make gains. In Grimsby - where Mr Farage went twice in the last six weeks - they came third.UKIP got around four million votes - with especially strong showings in north-east and south-east England - but it's ended up with just one MP, and a vacancy at the top. This has led to UKIP attacking the current system of choosing MPs, which it's described as ""busted"" and ""dysfunctional"".In one sense, this campaign was a complete failure and it's left an aftermath of angry voters, and others wondering if the UKIP bubble has burst.Read Robin Brant's Twitter hereI monitored 91 GB-wide voting intention polls during the 2015 election campaign and found nothing in them to prepare me for the final outcome.The good news for the pollsters was that their share for the Lib Dems was pretty close, as were the shares for UKIP, the Greens and the catch-all category of Others.The bad news for the polling industry was that the crucial shares for Conservative and Labour were the ones where they came most adrift.When all the qualifications of margins of error are allowed, there did appear to be a systematic overstatement of the Labour share and an equally systematic understatement of the Conservative one.It is for the pollsters to decide whether to conduct a review of their performance but I trust they will avoid the initial knee-jerk reaction of the immediate aftermath of the 1992 polls debacle.This general election performance follows the performance of the polls in the 2014 Scottish referendum where the choice was simply binary and yet all the polls were out by between 4-6%.Something is wrong. A lot of us would like to know what it is.Read more from David Cowling hereThe words ""political earthquake"" have been translated into numerous European languages, making front page news across the continent.While Britons now examine the domestic minutiae of the election result, here in mainland Europe the vote means one thing: a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU. And that has the potential to create an earthquake of its own.The guardian of the EU treaties Mr Cameron wants to change - Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker - has said again he'd listen to what Britain's new government proposed.Read more from Katya Adler here"

He's not the only party leader to face an attempted ousting. But can you recover from such a revolt?In 2006, the Labour prime minister was the target of what became known as the ""curry house conspiracy"" - a coup to remove him and install his chancellor, Gordon Brown, as prime minister.It would lead to several of the plotters' resignations - but not Mr Blair's. However, it was successful to a degree in that it forced the party leader into naming a departure date.The move against him was reportedly masterminded by Tom Watson, a defence minister at the time, who was also rumoured to have had a secret meeting with Mr Brown on the eve of the revolt.Apparently, Mr Watson and three fellow West Midlands MPs - Sion Simon, David Wright (both ministerial aides) and Khalid Mahmood - met over a biryani at a Wolverhampton curry house to discuss the PM's future, before dispatching a missive calling for him to quit.The letter - which attracted the support of a number of normally loyal Labour MPs - was leaked to the press, and ultimately resulted in Mr Watson's resignation.In his parting letter, the West Bromwich East MP took a shot at the prime minister, who he said should step down in the interests of party and country.Mr Blair denounced his actions and branded the former minister ""disloyal, discourteous and wrong"", saying he would have sacked him if he had not resigned.But Mr Watson's departure was swiftly followed by the resignations of six other junior members of government - who had also signed the rebel letter - in protest at the prime minister's refusal to say when he would step down as Labour leader.The whole affair resulted in Mr Blair announcing his intention to step aside within 12 months - which he duly did, on 27 June 2007.But it did nothing to quash internal dissent and speculation in the party over the future leadership of the party.Labour prime minister Gordon Brown found his leadership under threat in 2009 after one of his cabinet ministers dramatically quit the government and called for him to resign.Work and Pensions Secretary James Purnell - a former aide to Tony Blair - resigned from his post after the polls closed in the local and European elections, in which Labour was forecast to do badly.Explaining his decision to quit, Mr Purnell said the prime minister made a Conservative victory ""more, not less, likely"".It was Mr Brown's first direct challenge from a cabinet minister - but it would not topple the Labour leader as senior members of government refused to follow Mr Purnell's lead.Mr Brown was safe for the time being. But several months later, in January 2010, a fresh leadership challenge was mounted by two senior former Labour cabinet ministers.Geoff Hoon and Patricia Hewitt wrote to all Labour MPs, saying the party was ""deeply divided"" over Mr Brown's leadership and that the best way to resolve the issue was by way of secret ballot.They insisted it was not an ""attempted coup"" but a necessary step to resolve divisions within the party.But the duo could only muster the public support of a handful of backbenchers long-opposed to Mr Brown, with the majority of the party's MPs less than impressed by the move, which came just weeks before the general election.As the day wore on, a succession of cabinet ministers came out to back the PM, suggesting there was little momentum behind the plot - although it was noted that several were not exactly gushing in their support of Mr Brown.As history tells us, neither leadership challenge bore fruit but they reflected the internal doubts and divisions over Mr Brown at the helm.As leadership toppling attempts go, this one in 2014 was regarded as a particularly ""botched"" and ""shambolic coup"". Indeed, former Lib Dem leader Lord (Paddy) Ashdown described the move as a ""plot of deep malice"".Its instigator, Lord (Matthew) Oakeshott - a close ally of the-then Business Secretary Vince Cable - tried to unseat Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg.The peer was found to have commissioned secret polls suggesting the party would do better at the 2015 general election without Mr Clegg in the driving seat.The man Lord Oakeshott had long had in mind to take Mr Clegg's place - Mr Cable, who was on government business in China at the time - was forced to publicly condemn his friend's actions and state his backing for Mr Clegg.But Lord Oakeshott said the business secretary had in fact known about his polls and their findings.Nevertheless, the peer - who was denounced by the Lib Dem leadership for spending money that could have been spent on campaigning - quit the party, and issued a warning shot on his way out about the Lib Dems' future prospects.Mr Cable largely emerged unscathed but he faced questions about his loyalty to the leader. Although the two sought to put paid to reports of a rift with a (painfully awkward, 'nothing to see here, folks') stage-managed pint in a pub.Although the revolt failed, and Mr Clegg remained at the helm, the Lib Dems did go on to suffer a trouncing at the general election, losing nearly 50 of its MPs - one of them, Mr Cable himself - prompting his leader to quit.The Conservatives have a reputation for being more ruthless than their party rivals when it comes to getting rid of leaders they sense are no longer effectual.But, in 1995, Prime Minister John Major - tired of persistent rumours of a leadership challenge - decided to take the bull by the horns and trigger a surprise leadership election to silence his detractors.His own backbenchers had questioned Mr Major's ability to unite and lead the party, which was deeply divided over Europe.So ""put up or shut up"", he told them as he tendered his resignation as Conservative Party leader but not prime minister.But then stepped forward eurosceptic MP John Redwood, who resigned from the cabinet in order to contest Mr Major's leadership.This was unexpected by many, as the PM had said there had been assurances from his cabinet that none would stand against him.But Mr Major went on to win the ensuing election with a comfortable defeat over his challenger, who was not included in the PM's consequent cabinet reshuffle.No further contested leadership election took place until after the Conservatives' defeat at the 1997 general election, paving the way for William Hague to take over the running of the party.Not all attempts to oust a party leader end in failure: as Margaret Thatcher found out to her peril.With three electoral victories under her belt, the Conservative prime minister's downfall would come at the hands of her own party - not the voters.It was on 1 November 1990 when Geoffrey (now Lord) Howe - one of Mrs Thatcher's longest-serving ministers - resigned over differences with the party leader over Europe.In his now infamous speech on the floor of the House of Commons, he attacked the PM's policies and leadership style, comparing being one of her cabinet ministers to opening the batting at cricket only to find his bat had been ""broken... by the team captain"".It sparked the beginning of the end of the 11-year Thatcher reign.Michael (now Lord) Heseltine seized on the opportunity to challenge the prime minister in the ensuing leadership contest, from which she would eventually withdraw and John Major emerge as her successor. Reflecting on the revolt and its implications on the Conservative Party, Baroness Thatcher's biographer Charles Moore wrote: ""Because the coup was unjustified, and so trust broke down, the politics of the next 15 years were those of civil war."""
2015-05-10,Election swings and roundabouts,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-32741924,"If election manifesto claims are all about smoke and mirrors, should we now add swings and roundabouts to the political metaphor?There's an intriguing aspect to the general election results in the Midlands that puzzled me.It's the striking contrast in the swings between Labour and the Conservatives.David Cameron and his campaign strategists knew they were home and dry when Nuneaton was the first Midlands marginal to declare.It was not only a Tory hold but a swing to the Conservatives from Labour of 3%.I was in the Nottingham suburb of Beeston awaiting the result of the Broxtowe count. Would its high profile Conservative MP Anna Soubry survive a red surge?Nuneaton set the pattern. Across the Midlands, both east and west, there was a uniform swing of between three and four per cent to the Tories - Warwickshire North 3%, Amber Valley 4%, Derbyshire South 4% and Sherwood 4%. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan topped the Tory swingometer in the Midlands marginals with 5% in Loughborough.Yet in the big cities, it was a very different story. The swing went to Labour.So in Nottingham East they enjoyed a 6% swing, Nottingham South 5.8%, Leicester South 7.3%, Leicester West 5%, Birmingham Hall Green 12%, Birmingham Hodge Hill 8%.If swings to Labour on this scale had gone beyond the city ring road roundabouts and into the suburbs, Ed Miliband would have become prime minister by now.In confidence, one senior Labour insider in Nottingham told me its success in the city wards was down to organisation, experience and its teams of activists.""We won the ground war. If Nottingham's city boundaries were extended into Sherwood and Broxtowe, we would have won those constituencies as well,"" he told me.Labour leadership candidate, Leicester West's Liz Kendall has identified her party's problem beyond the ring road roundabout.It's about reaching out to Middle England.""We need to show people that we understand their aspirations and ambitions for the future,"" she told the Sunday Times.The problem for Labour was that Middle England was not interested in what the party offered…and still isn't. The Cameron brand worked its magic in those Midlands marginals... it'll take something or someone special to break up that ballot box relationship."
2015-05-10,Royal 'lobbying',https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32740154,"Prince Charles sent 27 letters to then Prime Minister Tony Blair and members of his government between September 2004 and March 2005, ""despite the Freedom of Information Act!"" as the prince joked in one.But did his suggestions and concerns have any bearing on the behaviour of Mr Blair's government?The request: Prince Charles expresses his worries over an EU directive on complementary medicines ""which is… effectively outlawing the use of certain herbal extracts"".  Mr Blair replied, offering moral support and practical help. He agreed that ""the implementation as it is currently planned is crazy"" and set out an action plan that included delaying implementation for all existing products to 2011. What happened: Herbal products were not required to be authorised until 2011, just as Mr Blair had promised. Prince Charles continues to sell his own brand of complementary products, Duchy Herbals, through Boots and Waitrose. The request: Writing to Mr Blair, the prince expresses a ""growing sense of anxiety"" that the Hill Farming Allowance, which supports farmers working on Britain's uplands, could be scrapped. In his reply, the prime minister said he understood that the Hill Farm Allowance would continue until 2007. What happened: The allowance lasted until the end of Labour's tenure in 2010, when it was abolished.The request: Just 18 months after the US-led invasion of Iraq, Prince Charles raised the issue of poor performance of Lynx helicopters in high temperatures, saying: ""I fear that this is just one more example of where our Armed Forces are being asked to do an extremely challenging job (particularly in Iraq) without the necessary resources.""Mr Blair replied: ""On the subject of the Lynx helicopter, the limitations of the existing platform, particularly in the extremely challenging environment within Iraq, are well recognised by the Ministry of Defence."" He added that replacement of the helicopters would be a priority. What happened: Mr Blair's comments go much further than what he was saying about the subject at the time. In the event, though, the fleet was not fully upgraded until 2011.The request: Prince Charles lamented that the government's TB prevention plans might not ""include a commitment to deal with the badger problem in the immediate future"" and pushed strongly for a cull, saying: ""All I can say is that I do urge you to look again at introducing a proper cull of badgers where it is necessary.""Mr Blair sympathised, saying he could ""personally see the case for culling badgers"". However, he was unwilling to commit to a cull.  What happened: Culling trials were conducted from 1998-2005. The final results, published in 2008, said that the badger cull could ""make no meaningful contribution"" to curbing bovine TB. It wasn't until 2013 that a full culling programme began in two pilot areas. These ended with the conclusion that the pilots had been neither humane nor effective at curbing the spread of TB.The request: Then Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell wrote to Prince Charles to say she had decided to give parts of the historic Smithfield meat market Grade II listed status, and was trying to persuade deputy prime minister John Prescott to ""call in"" the planning application to prevent demolition of other parts of the site. She had been swayed by evidence provided by Sir Neil Cossons, who was English Heritage chair at the time, after he had been asked by the prince to add his support. Prince Charles replied that he was ""extremely glad to read of your appreciation of the value of this group of buildings"". According to the Guardian, market workers desperate to see the redevelopment of the site invited the prince to meet them to discuss it, but his office said he was ""unlikely to accept as he did not want to interfere in the planning process"".What happened: Smithfield market is still the subject of planning battles a decade on. Successive planning applications have been refused by ministers. Last year then Communities Secretary Eric Pickles rejected plans for an office development on the site, stating that ""the extent of damage that the application would cause to the important heritage assets at Smithfield runs entirely counter to national and policy objectives intended to protect such assets from harm"".In March, the Museum of London announced a move from its current Barbican site to the Smithfield market building."
2015-05-10,Election fallout,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32703139,"""Some of those gimmicks - that tombstone, whatever idiot thought that up I do not know!""I was talking to the former Mayor of Crawley in Sussex, John Mortimer, in the town's Labour Supporters Club about the vexed question of what went wrong, and where Labour should go next. This seat is one of those southern seats Labour hoped to take, but failed.I hear a whole range of views in the club.""They didn't give nothing to depend on, they should be clear, and a little bit more down to Earth."" ""Good party, wrong leader, they don't look after business enough.""Councillor John Stanley tells me: ""I think in a way we did go too left, but now we can go a bit centre-left, or centre, depending who the new leader is.""The former mayor sums up the mood on the doorstep: ""Whatever we told them, they didn't believe us.""  Expect to hear all those views, and more, in the coming leadership contest. Step back from the angst of supporters, and it may not be that hard to see why Labour failed.  An economic recovery, hailed by independent organisations as the result of government policy, undid a party that had loudly proclaimed for five years that the coalition's policies would lead to economic disaster. Combine that with an uncharismatic and uninspirational leader, then you might argue no further debate is necessary.Fat chance of that. Defeat breeds resentment, and this one has opened up old divisions.  A chorus of Blairties, led by the man himself, has declared that Ed's problem was ignoring those with aspiration and ambition, failing to appeal to those running business. Incidentally, I've been ticked off by the perspicacious editor of the New Statesman, Jason Cowley, for using the ""unhelpful"" term ""Blairites"".I can't think of another description that fits Tony, Lord Mandelson, Lord Adonis and David Miliband quite so well. But call them what you will, the message was clear - Ed was too left wing, Labour should move back to the centre, or, if you like, to the right.Reading Mr Blair's pithy analysis, listening to Lord Mandelson's gripping and savage eloquence, describing a party sent out to shout: ""We love the poor and hate the rich,"" and so ignoring the middle, and you realise strong emotions are in play.But back to the future may not be sufficient. Of course elections are won on the centre ground. But grandees grinding axes, affronted by the failure of boys who used to make their tea, may be creating so much noise that they can't hear more insistent sounds.  For there are several elephants trumpeting loudly as they cram into the small space of the shadow cabinet room. Imagine these beasts are as gaily decorated as Berlin buddy bears. One is decked out in red, another in imperial purple bunting, and another, a mammoth, strong tusked and ice rimmed, painted yellow with tartan trimmings.Take the last first. The Scottish wipeout is Labour's biggest problem. Fail to solve it, and Labour can forget ever having a comfortable majority again. It is hard to argue Labour were wiped out in Scotland because the SNP outflanked them to the right with their appeal to the business community and the ambitious and aspirational. But it is true the SNP drew in to people from left, right and centre, just as the modernisers say Labour should. It was the politics of economic self-interest, but cast in a very different light. Tribally sneering at ""the reactionary ideology of nationalism"" as Mr Blair does, will not reach the central belt of Scotland, the middle ground of  Midlothian.What about that purple pachyderm?  In Crawley - in fact in seat after seat - there is a similar pattern.  Labour did, in fact, often increase the size of their vote. So did the Conservatives, usually by a bit more. But the real dynamic was the total collapse of the Lib Dems and the dramatic rise of UKIP. The increase in votes for Nigel Farage's party wasn't translated into parliamentary seats, but, although it is early days in terms of research, it probably hurt Labour a lot. If we believe - and I do - Matthew Goodwin and Rob Ford, authors of Revolt on the Right, these voters are often former Labour supporters - older, less educated, those left behind on the tides of  globalisation, stranded on the shores of post-industrialisation. They may have had too many disappointments to feel much ambition or aspiration. They are a challenge for Labour, and any new leader will spend a good deal of time thinking how to deal with the concerns of Europe and immigration.Whether to share their fears, or confront them will be a big decision.Which brings us to Red Nellie. Those members who still proudly call themselves socialist. This is not about Old Labour - they are more likely to be baristas or barristers than boilermakers. It is easy as an outsider, as a journalist, to treat politics as an intellectual game about how best to win power - but many people, particularly the foot soldiers, particularly after the death of  purely tribal loyalties, are in it because they passionately believe in winning  power to do something specific.Many of them are suspicious of the later incarnations of New Labour, not because it reached an accommodation with wealth and business, but because it seemed to worship at the same altar, to regard the party's core beliefs in redistribution and equality as childish fantasies from a past age.Perhaps to Mr Blair, they are the problem, people who may equate ""ambition"" with greed. They might point out that a man who claims to be worth ""only"" £20m may find it harder than most to squeeze through the eye of a needle to understand their point of view. Most successful Labour leaders will confront the left at some point, but the concerns of this group go to the existential question ""What is the party for?""This is not a polemic - not an argument about what should be done, but a reflection on the complex conundrums that will face any new Labour leader, the tearing apart of the old alliance that made up a Labour majority, and so the political need to satisfy groups with very different, indeed, contradictory demands. But looking for a Social Democratic universal theory of everything may be missing the point. What the party desperately wants is a leader who can pull the disparate threads together and articulate them as common purpose. Whether she or he exists is another matter.Much more on that in the coming months."
2015-05-10,'Take us with you',https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-32736153,"Thousands of people in the north of England have been using the hashtag ""take us with you Scotland"" to express their upset about the result of last week's general election, and Scottish nationalists are welcoming this English minority with open arms. Last Thursday's general election was a rough one for the Labour Party in its traditional stronghold in the north of England. But further to the north, the left-leaning Scottish National Party won nearly every seat it contested. That political contrast has made some left-wing voters in places like Manchester, Leeds and Sheffield look fondly on their neighbours. Since last Thursday's election in Britain the phrase ""take us with you Scotland"" has been used more than 24,000 times. ""Genuinely beginning to wonder if the North of England becoming a part of Scotland would be better for us, I really am,"" tweeted Aaron Miller from Yorkshire. Some cracked jokes under the tag after the North West Motorway Police account, which gives traffic updates, announced that they had ""picked up a pedestrian on the M62 who was trying to walk to Scotland.""After an initial spike of jokes over the weekend, the hashtag really took off when users start to mobilise in support of around a year-old petition on the campaigning site Change.org. The petition calls for the north of England to secede from the rest of the country and join up with Scotland, and more than 12,000 people have signed it.Its creator, a Sheffield resident who calls himself ""Stu Dent"", set it up to coincide with last year's Scottish independence referendum, and he also created a map imagining the boundary of a ""Scotland plus the north"" country.Stu Dent runs the Twitter account Hunters Bar, named after an area of southwest Sheffield which is very popular with - you guessed it - students. Despite the account having thousands of followers on Twitter, when the map was first posted last year, the image was shared only about 100 times - however, in the past week it's been retweeted by thousands. Stu Dent told BBC Trending that he was surprised at how popular his idea has become. ""In hindsight, perhaps I shouldn't have been,"" he said. ""There is a huge frustration in parts of the UK about the things that have happened since 2010.""""I think people need a place to go where they can say 'not in my name! This is not the England I want',"" he added. But in addition to disappointment from some quarters about the election result, there might be another reason why the petition is getting a boost now: the power of the Scottish Nationalists on Twitter. What started as a post-election joke in the North of England was quickly embraced by the so-called ""Cyber Nats"" - and a trend was born.The SNP's social media strategist Ross Colquhoun expressed the party's mood about the hashtag best, in a post which was shared more than 500 times. ""2014: #LetsStayTogether 2015: #TakeUsWithYouScotland What a difference a year makes"" he tweeted.Blog by Hannah HendersonNext story: The sport reporter and the obscene ranter who lost his jobFollow BBC Trending on Twitter @BBCtrending, and find us on Facebook."
2015-05-10,What Britain wants from Europe,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32695399,"David Cameron says he has a mandate to pursue EU reform following the Conservatives' general election victory. The PM, who will be hoping his majority government will give him extra leverage in Brussels, wants to renegotiate the terms of the UK's membership ahead of a referendum by the end of 2017. He has said he will campaign for Britain to remain in the EU if he gets the reforms he wants.Mr Cameron has said he does not want to reveal full details of his negotiating hand but he has given a broad indication, in a series of speeches and newspaper articles, of his priorities when he goes into talks with other EU leaders.These are: The prime minister has said Britain would resist any move towards a European Army and that he wants to free British police forces from EU interference. He has also ruled out Britain joining the euro.But he has placed less emphasis in recent years on demanding changes to EU social policy, such as the maximum 48-hour working week, agency workers, maternity leave and non-discrimination rules.The official UK government position is that a referendum will be held by the end of 2017 but Downing Street sources have said: ""If we can do it earlier we will.""There is speculation David Cameron is planning to hold the vote in 2016 to avoid a clash with French and German elections in 2017.The prime minister wants treaty change but even if the referendum was held in 2017 there may not be enough time to legally incorporate any reforms into a treaty and it would have to be done at a later stage.An early referendum would anger Eurosceptics who believe it would not allow enough time to make the case for exit or negotiate any meaningful concessions.""A rushed process would severely undermine the chances to secure a significant deal that both British business and voters could support and would waste the opportunity of a lifetime,"" Matthew Elliott, chief executive of Business for Britain told Breitbart London.The question is always crucial in any referendum and there is already a debate about what it should be. The Draft European Union (Referendum) Bill, published by the Conservatives in 2013, proposed this form of words: ""Do you think that the United Kingdom should remain a member of the European Union?""Some thought that leaned too far towards the status quo, encouraging a yes vote, and the Electoral Commission said it was not clear and direct enough. The watchdog proposed this form of words instead: ""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union?""The new Conservative government will attempt to repeal the Human Rights Act, which requires UK courts to treat the European Court of Human Rights as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. The European Court of Human Rights is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe (CoE), which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine.The freedom for people to move around Europe, enshrined in the EU treaties, works in parallel with the other three basic freedoms in the single market: freedom of goods, capital and services.It is likely to be a ""red line"" for other EU leaders, who do not want to see it eroded.Mr Cameron has steered clear of tackling it directly - for example by asking for an emergency ""brake"" on free movement, or a cap on numbers - focusing instead on reducing the incentive provided by welfare payments. In a speech last November, David Cameron set out measures to reduce the number of EU nationals moving to the UK.His main proposals were:Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission, has said he is ready to work with Mr Cameron to ""strike a fair deal for the United Kingdom in the EU"". The leaders of other EU nations have previously warned they are unlikely to support major changes to EU treaties to accommodate British demands. But Mr Cameron's general election victory may have given him extra leverage. ""The ball is very much in the court of the UK now,"" a senior EU official told The Guardian. ""It's up to the British to define what they want."" The key figure will be German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is very keen to keep Britain in the EU but has so far been unwilling to make major concessions to enable that to happen. There are fears that a ""pick and mix"" approach to EU treaties would undermine EU cohesion.Mr Cameron has said there is ""no doubt"" his planned reforms will require changes to the treaties governing the European Union. But this would require the unanimous support of all EU members, and may not be possible within the deadline he has set of a referendum before the end of 2017. Any attempt to change EU laws on free movement would meet fierce resistance from some EU nations, particularly Eastern European states. Mr Juncker has said free movement is non-negotiable.Mr Cameron may find it difficult to get unanimous support for his proposals for a four-year waiting period for migrant workers claiming UK benefits. East European EU members would be likely to oppose this, on the grounds that it would discriminate against their citizens.  Attempts to secure opt-outs for the City are unlikely to go down well with other European leaders.However, there are precedents for EU treaty changes to accommodate some countries' specific concerns - for example, the protocol attached to the Lisbon Treaty for Ireland.Mr Cameron has faced repeated calls to say whether he would campaign for Britain's exit from the EU in the referendum if he fails to get what he wants from the renegotiation process. All he has said is that he will ""rule nothing out"". Some Conservative MPs want Britain to leave the EU no matter what David Cameron manages to renegotiate. A larger group are likely to want more concessions than Mr Cameron has so far indicated he is prepared to demand.Senior backbencher David Davis, who was defeated by Mr Cameron for the Tory leadership in 2005, told the Daily Telegraph the majority of the 332 Conservative MPs want Mr Cameron to negotiate an ""opt-out"" power to stop individual EU laws from applying to Britain. The prime minister has said this would be ""impossible"" without Britain leaving the EU.Mr Davis claims as many as 60 Tory MPs would be prepared to rebel and vote for Britain's exit from the EU if the prime minister fails to deliver.Graham Brady, chairman of the Tory backbench 1922 committee, which represents backbenchers, has urged David Cameron to give all Conservative MPs, including ministers, a free vote in the EU referendum.In January, Mr Cameron warned that serving cabinet ministers would have to quit the government if they wanted to campaign to leave the EU if he had secured the reforms to it he wants.In the 1975 referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Economic Community, as the EU was then called, Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson decided to suspend collective responsibility because his cabinet was split on the issue. Ministers were allowed to vote with their consciences and campaign against each other. The majority of them, including Mr Wilson, joined the Yes camp, but left-wingers, such as Tony Benn, played a leading role in the No campaign. The Yes campaign won easily with 67% of the vote."

Mr Murphy said he would tender his resignation alongside a plan to reform the party.He lost his seat in last week's general election as the SNP won 56 of the 59 Scottish seats, leaving Labour with a single MP in Scotland.Mr Murphy said he wanted to have a successor as leader in place by the summer, and confirmed he would not be standing for a seat at the Scottish Parliament in next year's election. Instead, he said it was time to ""do something else"" and that he believed the party would continue to be divided if he remained as leader. His deputy, Kezia Dugdale MSP, will become acting leader until a permanent successor is found. Mr Murphy had faced calls to resign from several MSPs, trade unions and former MPs in the wake of his party's near wipeout at the general election.He insisted he had decided to stand down ahead of the national executive voting by 17-14 in favour of him staying in the job.Speaking at a media conference after the national executive meeting, he said: ""It is clear that a small minority who didn't accept my election as leader of the Scottish Labour Party just five months ago won't accept the vote of the executive today and that will continue to divide the party.""Today I received more support in the executive vote than I did from members of the executive when I stood for election five months ago.""He said it would be up to the executive whether to accept the reforms he would be proposing before he left the post. But he warned: ""A party in such urgent need of reform blocks those changes at its peril.""The former East Renfrewshire MP said Labour had been crushed between ""two nationalisms"" in Scotland and England.Mr Murphy said he left no legacy of bitterness for anyone in the Labour Party, and the only person he was angry at was the person who blamed Scottish Labour for the party's UK-wide general election defeat - a reference to Unite leader Len McCluskey.And he said that in many ways Scottish Labour was the ""least modernised part of the Labour movement"" and that he wanted his successor to be elected under a one member, one vote system.Mr Murphy added: ""The Labour Party's problem is not the link with trade unions, or even the relationship with Unite members - far from it. It is the destructive behaviour of one high profile trade unionist.""The leader of the Scottish Labour Party doesn't serve at the grace of Len McCluskey, and the next leader of the UK Labour Party should not be picked by Len McCluskey.""Mr McCluskey has been a vocal critic of Mr Murphy's leadership and opposed his appointment in December when Mr Murphy won the contest to replace Johann Lamont.Jim Murphy laughed and joked with Scottish Labour's sole MP as he made his way down the hotel corridor to announce his resignation.He certainly brought energy and dynamism to his election campaign - but all that achieved was Ian Murray in Edinburgh South.So as Mr Murphy bows out, who could replace him?The deputy leader Kezia Dugdale may want to step up or Neil Findlay could try again after challenging last time. Maybe the party's finance spokeswoman Jackie Baillie thinks her steady hand could steer the ship.Jenny Marra is also often talked about as future face of the party.Whoever steps into Jim Murphy's red shoes he or she will have to face a difficult 2016 Holyrood election, to put it mildly.There are also more fundamental questions about how the party can possibly move on as it faces a surging SNP.Mr Murphy was very much a creature of ""New Labour"" - but to today's generation that's old Labour.Party members may start looking for someone with no links to the past, neither a Brownite nor a Blairite. A 'cleanskin' - as the politicos put it - may well help re-connect with voters.That's a long way from now though - even some of the party's opponents may view this latest train wreck with a modicum of sympathy. Ms Lamont had resigned after claiming Scottish Labour was treated like a ""branch office"" by the London-based party leadership.Mr Murphy concluded his speech by saying: ""Scotland needs a strong Labour party; Scotland needs a united Labour party. We have been the greatest force for change in our nation's remarkable history. ""The Scottish Labour party will rise again. It will be under someone else's leadership and I am confident about my party's future.""Harriet Harman MP, acting leader of the UK Labour Party, said it would be for Scottish Labour to choose a new leader. She added: ""As a cabinet minister and leader of his party in Scotland, Jim has been a hugely important figure in the Labour Party. He leaves with the best wishes and thanks of our movement.""Labour peer Lord McConnell, a former Scottish first minister, said the party's problems were ""much deeper than one individual and one affiliate"".He said: ""We have a disconnect locally and nationally with wider Scottish society. ""We have a problem with our political positioning in the post devolution age where the party particularly at the UK level has never been comfortable with success in the Scottish parliament and has always tried to see things through a UK prism rather than a Scottish prism.""We need to find a new generation, a new leader, new generation, new ideas, a fresh approach.""In a tweet, Scottish first minister and SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said: ""I wish Jim Murphy all the very best for the future. Leadership is not easy and he deserves credit for standing up for what he believes in.""Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson also reacted on Twitter, saying: ""Jim Murphy announces a managed exit in order to help the party, which is to his credit. But leaves a tough gig for whoever comes next.""The meeting of Scottish Labour's executive was disrupted by protesters who entered the party's headquarters.Police were called and the protesters, who included persistent anti-austerity activists Sean Clerkin and Piers Doughty-Brown, left the building to protest further from the street outside.The protesters were calling for Mr Murphy to remain as leader to ""finish the job of destroying Scottish Labour"".A Police Scotland spokeswoman said officers had been called and found two protestors on the third floor of the building. She added: ""Both left on police arrival. Advice and assistance was given."""
2015-05-11,Labour contenders clash on spending,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32761561,"Prospective Labour leaders have clashed over Labour's record in government in their first public debate in the race to succeed Ed Miliband.Former cabinet ministers including Yvette Cooper and Andy Burnham defended Labour's fiscal record and spending on schools and hospitals.However, candidates from the 2010 intake of MPs argued that the party spent too much while in office.The debate followed Chuka Umunna's withdrawal from the leadership contest.The remaining candidates appeared at the annual conference of the Progress think tank in London.There was agreement that Labour needed to demonstrate economic credibility to regain power, with shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt telling the meeting that the party needed to be ""trusted with public finances and the family finances"".Mr Hunt, who was first elected to Parliament in 2010 when Labour lost power, argued the last Labour government ""spent too much"" and failed to ""leave enough economic headroom to deal with the economic crisis and the recession"".Shadow health minister Liz Kendall said: ""There's absolutely nothing progressive about spending more on debt interest payments than on educating our children.""But shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: ""The Tories have had a triumph of spin over the facts in saying what they said about the economic record of the last Labour government.""The former chief secretary to the Treasury said the deficit did ""grow too large"" in the government's later years but insisted: ""The last Labour government ran more surpluses in its first term than the Tories did in 18 years.""Yvette Cooper, another former chief secretary to the Treasury, said: ""We should never let anybody tell us that it was too many teachers, doctors or nurses that caused Lehman Brothers bank in New York to crash.""Shadow international development secretary Mary Creagh said: ""People have forgotten the economic credibility that the last Labour government had.""She said Labour had built schools and hospitals that were ""treasured in our communities"".Ms Cooper, Mr Burnham, Ms Kendall and Ms Creagh have declared their intention to run for leader, while Mr Hunt told the conference he would make an announcement next week.At the same event, shadow energy secretary Caroline Flint announced she would be running for deputy leader.The Don Valley MP told the Today programme ahead of the debate that Labour lost the election because ""fundamentally the public did not trust us on the economy"".Exeter MP Ben Bradshaw has already announced a bid to be deputy, saying Labour ""must and could win the next election"", but only if it ""broadens its appeal by adopting sensible, centre-left politics which celebrate wealth creation and entrepreneurship"".Former Labour campaign co-ordinator Tom Watson is reported to be crowd-funding a deputy leadership bid, while Walthamstow MP Stella Creasy has said she is ""open to the question"" of running.Barnsley East MP and shadow transport secretary Michael Dugher - a fierce critic of Ed Miliband's election campaign - is to run Mr Burnham's campaign, according to the website LabourList.It is reported that Mr Burnham also has the backing of Labour peer Lord Falconer, who was lord chancellor and justice secretary under Tony Blair and was close to the former PM.Shadow culture secretary Chris Bryant has signalled his backing for Ms Cooper, tweeting that the next leader must be ""someone who's been tried in the fiery furnace of public opinion"".Mr Hunt said on Friday he would be be attending the debate - along with the other four hopefuls - to ""set out my analysis on how we begin to understand what went so wrong and why"".He added: ""We must use this leadership election to ask some very profound questions.""All voices in the party must be heard so that we can have a full and proper assessment as to why the politics of nationalism triumphed in Scotland and huge swathes of England, and how we have allowed the Conservative Party to present a more compelling vision for Britain to so many millions of people.""Speculation still surrounds shadow business secretary Mr Umunna's decision to pull out on Friday, when he said he was not ""comfortable"" with the ""pressure"" of being a candidate.As well as citing extensive pressure and scrutiny Mr Umunna also said he was ruling himself out because of concerns about the impact of the bid on his family.A rising star of the party, Mr Umunna was first elected to Parliament in 2010 - alongside Tristram Hunt and Liz Kendall - before joining the shadow cabinet.Asked about the candidate who might win, Conservative Chancellor George Osborne said: ""The Labour leadership contest has descended into farce.""But it's not actually about personalities. I don't think the Labour Party any more represents the working people of this country who aspire to a better life."""

I'm not suggesting he takes a break from being leader.""Clearly the national executive has the authority, they're the ruling body. ""I'm told that they made a decision. I'm told it was a procedurally correct decision, he is the leader but I think it's important that as leader he takes a break and I think it's important that we work out how these complex questions are answered by a team.""No one person has all the answers. I'm particularly concerned about tone, making sure we get a tone that ensures that the 27 million people who didn't vote for UKIP last week may be persuaded to vote for us in future.""The party has been beset by wrangling since Mr Farage agreed to stay on as leader, days after standing down after failing to get elected in Thanet South.He had pledged before the general election that he would quit the post if he failed to get elected to Parliament.Senior aide Matthew Richardson has left the party, following claims from MEP Patrick O'Flynn that Mr Farage had fallen under the influence of ""inexperienced"" advisers.UKIP has also confirmed the departure of Mr Farage's chief of staff Raheem Kassam.Mr Farage ruled out quitting as leader on BBC's Question Time on Thursday, saying he had ""phenomenal"" support, and has challenged his critics to decide whether they want to stay in the party.In his article, Mr Carswell had said that ""knowing how difficult it is to lead a party makes me admire Nigel Farage all the more"".""I know that I never could,"" he added, stressing that he would find it ""impossible to simultaneously lead UKIP, be the voice of the party in the Commons, represent my Clacton constituents and at the same time be a husband and a dad"".However, he said that ""even leaders need to take a break"", adding: ""Nigel needs to take a break now.""UKIP got nearly four million votes at the election, but returned only one MP - former Conservative Mr Carswell in the Clacton constituency."

Under the plans, ministers could force schools rated as ""requiring improvement"" and missing new government benchmarks to become an academy.Coasting schools have average results which have often flatlined over time.Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, Mrs Morgan said faster action was needed.She said: ""Our big priorities will be to speed up the process for tackling failing schools; extend our academies programme to tackle 'coasting' schools; and deliver on our commitment to open new free schools.""The proposals will be in a new bill due to be introduced in the Queen's Speech. ""First, we will take new powers to step in from the moment that a school is found to be failing,"" Mrs Morgan said.""From day one, regional schools commissioners will be able to bring in new leadership and support from other excellent schools and heads, and we will speed up the process of turning schools into academies to make sure that new expert leadership is found for all schools that need it as quickly as possible.""She said that coasting schools will be put on an immediate notice to improve and could then be taken over and turned into an academy.They will be required to work with a team of ""expert"" head teachers.She said: ""Those that aren't able to demonstrate a clear plan for improvement will be given new leadership - we know this works in turning schools around.""More than 3,300 schools in England are labelled ""requires improvement"", but the plans are unlikely to cover that many schools.Under the current system, secondary schools are considered to be failing, and therefore eligible for intervention, if fewer than 40% of their students score at least five Cs at GCSE, including English and maths, and they do not meet national averages in pupil progress.In primary schools, the threshold for intervention is if fewer than 65% of pupils get Level 4 in reading, writing and maths and a below average number of pupils make the expected amount of progress.It is not yet clear how coasting schools will be deemed in need of intervention.It is understood that a new category will be devised covering schools which are rated as ""requires improvement"" and which fail to meet a new set of standards on improvement."
2015-05-11,Co-op Group to keep political funding,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-32762858,"The Co-operative Group has decided to continue financially supporting the Co-operative Party, which has strong ties to Labour.Members of the group, the UK's biggest mutual organisation, voted on the issue at their annual general meeting.They passed a motion by 48,579 for, to 39,479 against, to approve ""political expenditures"" of up to £1m which support the movement's objectives.Last year the Co-op Group gave £625,000 to the Co-op Party.This figure was down on the sums donated in previous years. The AGM also included a vote on new corporate governance procedures which would mean members having less of a direct say.The Co-operative Group is still recovering from a period of financial mismanagement and some members have recently expressed concerns about how elections to the board are chosen.The banking arm of the group came close to collapse in 2013, bringing the whole group to a £2.5bn annual loss that year. The Co-op Party includes among its members a number of Labour MPs, including shadow chancellor Chris Leslie and Walthamstow MP Stella Creasy. The politicians stand as candidates of both the Co-operative Party and the Labour Party, and the two political movements have strong historical ties. The board asked the members of the Co-operative Group whether they wanted to continue financially supporting the Co-operative Party, or any other party. Allan Leighton, chairman of the Co-op Group, said: ""There's a clear remit from the members to continue to support the Labour Party.""It allows us to now have a conversation with the Co-op Labour Party about what we do next.""There was also a members' motion on the agenda, put forward by those in favour of making political donations of up to £1m a year.The motion to approve political funding ""not to exceed £1m per annum"" was carried by 55.17% to 44.83%.BBC business correspondent Joe Lynam said: ""To meet a £1.5bn hole in its accounts - mostly stemming from its banking division - the Co-op Group has had to sell off parts of its businesses and hand over majority control of its bank to American hedge funds.""It's also in the process of radically changing the way it runs itself into a more corporate structure with less of a direct say by its members.""He said that ""in theory"", each of the 2.8 million Co-op members could vote on a series of motions about the reforms, as well as how its bosses are paid, and retaining the links to the Co-operative party.One of the group's largest independent societies, Midcounties, recently threatened legal action over a shortlist of six candidates for the group's board being reduced to three - the number of positions available - before a member vote.

2015-05-11,Osborne plans July 'stability' Budget,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32761566,"Chancellor George Osborne has said that he will deliver a new Budget on 8 July.He claimed it would have ""a laser-like focus"" on raising productivity and living standards.He said he was making the unusual move of having a second Budget in one year in order to ""deliver on the commitments we have made to working people"".Labour said the chancellor would have to set out ""who is going to pay"" for what it called ""uncosted promises"" in the election campaign.Speaking outside 11 Downing Street, the chancellor gave a broad outline of his plans for the forthcoming Budget but refused to be drawn on the details, including the Conservatives' planned £12bn of welfare cuts.""I don't want to wait to deliver on the commitments we have made to working people,"" he said.""It will continue with the balanced plan we have to deal with our debts, invest in our health service and reform welfare to make work pay.""But there will also be a laser-like focus on making our economy more productive so we raise living standards across our country.""We're going to put Britain into good shape for the long term.""The last Budget was held on 18 March and included tax cuts for first-time house buyers.Writing in the Sun, Mr Osborne admitted it was ""unusual"" to have two Budgets in the same year, but he wanted to turn ""promises made in the election into a reality"".Again, Mr Osborne did not specifically outline how the Conservatives plan to fulfil a pledge to cut £12bn in welfare spending but said he wants to make the welfare system ""fair for the people who pay for it"".He writes: ""We will protect the NHS and give it more funding each and every year, while making savings across Whitehall. ""We'll crack down hard on tax avoidance and aggressive tax planning by the rich - because everyone should pay their fair share.  ""We will always protect the most vulnerable, but we also need a welfare system that's fair to the people who pay for it. If you can work you should be working, so we'll take the next steps in our benefit reforms to make sure that happens.""Second, we've got to go on helping businesses create jobs in Britain, so we move towards full employment. That means facing a hard truth: in Britain we produce about a quarter less for every hour we work than countries like America or Germany. Fixing that long-running productivity weakness is the big challenge for the next five years.""So in the Budget we'll spend less on welfare, and instead invest to create three million more apprenticeships, so that young people can learn a trade, get better jobs and earn more.""After the Budget in March independent forecaster the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said that Mr Osborne needed to spell out exactly how he plans to cut £12bn from welfare spending.Of those £12bn planned cuts, £2bn were outlined ahead of the general election - all the cuts are supposed to be in place by 2017-18.Labour's shadow energy and climate change secretary, Caroline Flint, accused the Tories of making ""a number of uncosted promises"" during the election campaign.She told the BBC: ""It will be interesting to see who is going to pay for those uncosted policies when they bring the Budget in July."""

If it isn't, stop it and do something else.""He also criticised Mr Farage's comments about HIV patients during the TV leaders' debate last month.While debating about the NHS, Mr Farage said: ""You can come into Britain from anywhere in the world and get diagnosed with HIV and get the retro-viral drugs that cost up to £25,000 per year per patient.""Mr Carswell wrote: ""By all means we should highlight the problem of health tourism. But we need to admit that using the example of HIV patients to make the point was ill-advised.""He said the party needed to strike ""the right tone"" and added: ""UKIP has been at its most persuasive when we have been most optimistic.""Anger is never a great way to motivate people - at least not for very long.""The party has been beset by wrangling since Mr Farage agreed to stay on as leader, days after standing down after failing to get elected in Thanet South.He had pledged before the general election that he would quit the post if he failed to get elected to Parliament.Matthew Richardson has left the party, following claims from MEP Patrick O'Flynn that Mr Farage had fallen under the influence of ""inexperienced"" advisers.

They absolutely loved how he helped them and he was a highly-regarded local MP,"" Mr Bone said.""He stood up for what was right rather than what the party line was. In those days - the John Major years - it was much more difficult to stand up against the party machine. He had strong views on Europe.""Sir Peter started his career as an insurance broker, joining the Wycombe Young Conservatives in 1949 and the Oxford University Conservative Association in 1951.He went on to become a Conservative councillor on Buckinghamshire County Council between 1961 and 1967.Wellingborough mayor-elect Barry Graves also paid tribute to Sir Peter, remembering him as a ""very strong constituency MP"".""I remember going out and canvassing with him and he would go everywhere. He knew the area and the people. He was very much a man of the local constituency.""He was ""a very approachable man"", Mr Graves added.Sir Peter was knighted in 1994. "

The Smith proposals included giving Holyrood the power to set income tax rates and bands, as well as control over a share of VAT and some welfare benefits. But Ms Sturgeon's SNP also wants the Scottish Parliament to be given powers over business taxes, employment law, the minimum wage and additional powers over welfare.Speaking after meeting Ms Sturgeon, Mr Cameron told the BBC: ""Let's make sure Smith is implemented in full. I'm going to keep the commitment I made to the people of Scotland. Let's get that done first because it does create a really strong Scottish Parliament.""He added: ""Of course, if people want to make future proposals I'll look at them.""The prime minister again said he did not support full fiscal autonomy for Scotland - the responsibility for all areas of tax and spending except defence and foreign affairs - stating that it would mean £7bn of cuts or extra tax-raising.What Nicola Sturgeon is trying to say is she has a mandate. She has 56 out of the 59 MPs elected in Scotland and she won 50% of the vote - unprecedented here in Scotland.She says that gives her leverage to push David Cameron. David Cameron says he wants to keep the nation together.The language coming out of Westminster last week was very much a cordial one. 'We will listen'.Nicola Sturgeon has warned him that if he doesn't listen, then the people of Scotland will judge him accordingly.Ms  Sturgeon described the hour-long talks at her official residence at Bute House as ""constructive and business-like"". She said Mr Cameron had made a ""commitment"" that the Smith proposals would be implemented ""as agreed"".""But secondly the prime minister agreed that he would look at proposals that we would now send to suggest the areas we can go beyond Smith,"" Ms Sturgeon said.""There was no agreement in terms of the substance of that but we will submit those proposals, the prime minister has said they will consider them and there will be a meeting to look at how we take that further forward.""Referring to her party's success in last week's general election, which saw the SNP win 56 out of 59 Scottish seats, Ms Sturgeon said: ""People in Scotland have now voted fairly convincingly for the SNP and sent a message that we want the Smith Commission proposals to go further and be built on.""The ball is in his court but I'm going into this in good faith.""She added: ""David Cameron and I are a world apart politically but, where we can, I'm determined to do business in the interests of the people of Scotland and across the UK.""She said she would have a ""constructive and business-like"" relationship with the prime minister. The two leaders shook hands on the front steps of Bute House as Mr Cameron arrived. Mr Cameron left the building shortly before 11:00, almost an hour after he had arrived.The two sides agreed to hold more regular discussions in the future, possibly quarterly. "
2015-05-11,Umunna withdraws Labour leader bid,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32748106,"Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna has withdrawn from the Labour party leadership contest, just days after throwing his hat into the ring.The MP, 36, said in a statement that he was not comfortable with the level of pressure and scrutiny that came with being a leadership candidate.Mr Umunna also cited concerns about the impact of the bid on his family.BBC political editor Nick Robinson said the MP's team insisted no ""unwelcome press story"" lay behind the move.But Mr Umunna had been shocked by the level of scrutiny of himself, his mother, sister and girlfriend, he said.You can follow the latest reaction here.A rising star of the party, Mr Umunna was first elected to Parliament in 2010 before joining the shadow cabinet.He confirmed his candidacy for the Labour leadership via a post on his Facebook page on 12 May, saying the party under Ed Miliband had failed to appeal to enough voters in England.But on Friday he said he had not found the leadership bid to be ""a comfortable experience"".I understand that Chuka Umunna has told friends that ""this is not right for me or people close to me. I'm human, the rest of my life is more important to me than politics.""The shadow business secretary has been distressed by the degree of scrutiny he, his family and his girlfriend have come under since he declared his intention to stand for the labour leadership.I am told that this includes reporters waiting outside the houses of relatives late at night.Friends of Mr Umunna deny that he is nervous of not getting the support of enough MPs to run for the leadership; they point out that he already has half the necessary names and that there are some weeks to go.The shadow business secretary now wants to play a leading role in arguing that Britain should stay in the EU and does not rule out seeking the leadership in the future.He said he thought he had understood ""the scrutiny and attention a leadership contest would bring"", but added: ""However, since the night of our defeat last week I have been subject to the added level of pressure that comes with being a leadership candidate.""The shadow business secretary said he had wondered if it was too soon for him to stand for the leadership, and ""I fear it was."" He also cited concerns about the impact on ""the rest of one's life"" and those close to him.""Consequently, after further reflection, I am withdrawing my candidacy,"" he said.Mr Umunna said he would continue to serve as shadow business secretary and hoped to ""play a leading role"" in Labour's campaign to keep the UK in the EU during the forthcoming in/out referendum.Commenting on the news, Labour former culture secretary Ben Bradshaw - who is expected to run for deputy leader - said Mr Umunna was a ""terrible loss"" to the field.He told the BBC's Daily Politics the Streatham MP had been the candidate the Conservative Party ""feared the most"".""And if it's the result of pressure on an extended family or an extended group of friends, I think that's a very sad reflection on our political culture,"" he said.Chuka Umunna feels ""liberated"", he told me, by his decision to quit the Labour leadership race.He hopes to be given a good role (shadow chancellor, I wonder?) by whoever becomes Labour leader. And I expect he'll become very high profile in the campaign to keep Britain in Europe, which is increasingly looking like it will be next May.He'll endorse a candidate in the next four weeks before nominations close. It will be very interesting to see who he piles in behind.Read more from Allegra (see post 13.23).Former Labour leader Lord Kinnock said he thought Mr Umunna had made the right decision.He said: ""If he felt in his soul that he wasn't prepared to subject himself - and more importantly his family - to the kind of attention which is fairly typical, sadly, these days, he has done absolutely the right thing.""There is no point at all in inflicting avoidable, unnecessary misery on those you love most.""Leadership contender Mary Creagh said she had ""huge respect"" for Mr Umunna, telling BBC Radio 4's World at One programme it took ""courage"" to withdraw from the leadership race.Mr Umunna was ""a big beast"" and would play a ""big role"" in the future of the Labour Party, she added.Yvette Cooper, Andy Burnham, Liz Kendall and Mary Creagh have already thrown their hats into the ring for Labour's top job while a number of other potential candidates, including Dan Jarvis, Alan Johnson and David Lammy, have ruled themselves out. Candidates must secure nominations from 34 colleagues - 15% of the party's MPs - by 15 June to make it on to ballot papers, which will be sent to members in August ahead of the leader's election a month later."

However, Mr Justice Stuart Smith at Southwark Crown Court said there was a ""very strong likelihood"" a custodial sentence would follow.The jury heard how Mote submitted numerous false expenses claims for payment for work that organisations had allegedly carried out on his behalf.Mote claimed the money was to pay whistleblowers in cash through third parties. He also said he had been ""targeted for being an anti-EU MEP.""During his time an MEP he also made £250,000 legitimate expenses claims.No date has been set for the sentencing."

2015-05-11,Round-up: BBC experts' analysis,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/election-2015-32650417,"The political future of the United Kingdom has become clearer after the results of the general election emerged around the country.David Cameron says he hopes to govern for all of the UK after the Conservatives took 331 seats - enough to form a slender majority in the Commons.Labour has been all but wiped out by the SNP in Scotland and suffered a disappointing set of results elsewhere, while the Lib Dems are left with just eight MPs after many party heavyweights such as Vince Cable and Danny Alexander lost their seats.So with battles won and lost and the fall-out and celebrations beginning, BBC correspondents examine the implications and challenges that lie ahead for the new government - and for those whose political careers have been ended by voters.No pollster, no pundit, no political leader saw it coming - not even David Cameron himself.Governing parties don't gain seats. Parties that have implemented painful cuts and are promising more certainly don't. Until that is the Conservative Party did - achieving what had seemed to be Mission Impossible - a Tory majority.Until that is David Cameron's personal triumph which triggered the near simultaneous resignation of his three principle opponents - Messrs Miliband, Clegg and Farage.They did so in part because they helped to crush their partners in coalition these last five years - reducing the Liberal Democrat parliamentary party to a size when it can fit into two London taxis and still have two seats to spare.In part because the extraordinary tidal wave of support for the SNP swept dozens of once safe Labour seats away.In part because Nigel Farage persuaded millions to vote for him but secured just one seat - not, though, the one he was standing in.Read more from Nick Robinson hereThe question uppermost in the prime minister's mind as he assembles his new government is how to keep the kingdom united.""Above all I want to bring our country together,"" he revealed after the result, ""to reclaim a mantle we should never have lost - the mantle of one nation, one United Kingdom"".Looking at the political landscape from Land's End today is very different to the view from John O'Groats.A sea of Conservative and Unionist blue dominates the scene across much of England, while a field of SNP nationalist yellow stretches to the horizon and beyond from the north.David Cameron's greatest challenge is to prevent the union he supports being torn apart by mutual resentment - resentment from Scotland at a Westminster government dominated by English Tories, and resentment from England at the preferential treatment people think is being given to the Scots.Those who assumed the future of the Union had been safeguarded by the Scottish referendum must think again.Read more from Mark Easton hereOne thing is rock-solid true: the Conservatives who worked on this campaign are as surprised by the result as the pollsters, pundits, politicians and general population.Maybe they shouldn't be - the economy is in good shape and the Conservatives had incumbency advantage.But when I travelled back from the prime minister's last rally with a group of exhausted Conservative campaign officials it was clear that 290 seats was a hoped-for target.No-one talked about anything over 300 seats, and no-one even mentioned an overall majority.So what special sauce pushed David Cameron into No 10 with a Commons majority?Mr Cameron had two simple messages in the campaign and he rarely veered away from them; the first - the economy is in good shape and the recovery is threatened by Labour. And the second - the SNP would hold a Labour-led government to ransom.Read more from Jonny Dymond hereBrian Taylor, BBC political editor, ScotlandOf all the comments on the overnight apocalypse, undoubtedly the most straightforward came from a defeated Scottish Labour MP.Since there were quite a few of them, let me narrow the focus a little. Come on down, Tom Harris.Mr Harris had plainly anticipated defeat. Nonetheless, he looked suitably lugubrious as his fate was confirmed.Why, he was asked eagerly, had Labour lost? ""Because we did not win enough votes.""Psephologically, it is perfect. Complete in itself. Psychologically, it sums up Labour's gloom without descending into subsidiary matters such as leadership, strategy and the rest. As a forward-thinking strategy, it is ideal. Win more votes. Simple.Read more from Brian Taylor hereThis has been an election which may have more profound consequences than almost any in living memory.We now face a generational decision about our future in Europe, with an EU referendum in two years' time almost certain.There will also be serious questions about the future of the Union, following an SNP landslide that has turned Scotland into a virtual one-party state.David Cameron's victory also represents a colossal achievement.Only once before in recent history has an incumbent government increased its majority - and that was Mrs Thatcher in her prime in the 1980s.It is also a significant personal victory for Mr Cameron and a rebuff for those in his party who had become increasingly sceptical about his ability to win.But while it may represent a defeat for those Tories who saw this election as a potential opportunity to rid themselves of David Cameron, he must now govern with a wafer-thin majority.For the SNP, their stunning victory can only increase the pressure on Nicola Sturgeon to include a commitment to a second independence referendum in her party's manifesto for next year's Scottish elections.It is an election which has not just defied all the predictions of the pollsters and pundits - but which may yet prompt the most fundamental re-casting of British politics for a generation.Read more from Norman Smith hereAfter an extraordinary night, some brief conclusions:Read more from James Landale hereIs this the end of the union?That is the question many people will be asking this morning after the party which has fought for Scottish independence for 80 years swept to victory.The answer from the jubilant Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon is a firm ""No"".She insists that her MPs will speak for all of Scotland, not just for the 45% who voted for the country to leave the United Kingdom last September.In the closing hours of the most extraordinary election campaign which anyone in Scotland can remember, Ms Sturgeon turned to talk of ""legitimacy.""That will be her watchword in the coming days as she argues that the prime minister cannot ignore the democratic will of the Scottish people.Politically, Scotland and England this morning look and feel like very different countries.Read more from James Cook hereAfter weeks of chatter about an election too close to call, it wasn't that close at all.David Cameron will be continuing as our prime minister.So, what is all this likely to mean?A referendum on whether the UK stays in, or leaves, the European Union, within the next two-and-a-half years.A race to be the next leader of the Labour Party.A race to be the next leader of the Liberal Democrats.And a huge new presence of Scottish National Party MPs at Westminster.And so here's another thing we know for certain this morning: Politics ain't going to be boring any time soon.Read more from Chris Mason hereFor Labour the story of their terrible night is rapidly turning into the search for a new leader. So who will that be?Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, is almost certain to run.  Even before this election, both he and another almost inevitable candidate, Chuka Umunna, had raised eyebrows inside the party at the work they had put in, preparing the ground with members and the unions for potential bids.Yvette Cooper, before the election, was still thought not to have made up her mind over whether to run. That decision has been made perhaps a little easier as her husband, Ed Balls, has lost his seat.She is certainly potentially in the frame, along with two lesser known names - Liz Kendall and Dan Jarvis - two MPs who were only elected in 2010 for the first time. This could be their moment. But whoever is in the job, they face a monumental task.Read Laura Kuenssberg's Twitter hereSterling is up (the most for seven years against the euro), share prices are up (especially bank shares like Lloyds and RBS, and energy shares such as Centrica), government bond prices are up.To state the obvious, investors love the Tories' general election victory.There are a few reasons.One (no surprise here) is that Labour's threat of breaking up banks and imposing energy price caps has been lifted.Second is that investors have been discounting days and weeks of wrangling after polling day over who would form the government - and so they are semi-euphoric that we already know who's in charge.Third, many investors tend to be economically conservative and instinctively Conservative.But although the City may be a bit drunk on the result, its pleasure in Ed Miliband's and Ed Balls' humiliation may be making it a bit blind - perhaps dangerously so - to some bumps in the economic road ahead.Read more from Robert Peston hereNigel Farage dreamed of holding the balance of power, but in the end his UKIP party is now worse off than when it came into the election.At the seventh time of asking he was rejected - this time by the people of Thanet South. It was a similar story in Rochester and Strood where Mark Reckless, who sensationally defected from the Tories last year, was also sent packing.In seats on UKIP's target list, like Thurrock in Essex, the party failed to make gains. In Grimsby - where Mr Farage went twice in the last six weeks - they came third.UKIP got around four million votes - with especially strong showings in north-east and south-east England - but it's ended up with just one MP, and a vacancy at the top. This has led to UKIP attacking the current system of choosing MPs, which it's described as ""busted"" and ""dysfunctional"".In one sense, this campaign was a complete failure and it's left an aftermath of angry voters, and others wondering if the UKIP bubble has burst.Read Robin Brant's Twitter hereI monitored 91 GB-wide voting intention polls during the 2015 election campaign and found nothing in them to prepare me for the final outcome.The good news for the pollsters was that their share for the Lib Dems was pretty close, as were the shares for UKIP, the Greens and the catch-all category of Others.The bad news for the polling industry was that the crucial shares for Conservative and Labour were the ones where they came most adrift.When all the qualifications of margins of error are allowed, there did appear to be a systematic overstatement of the Labour share and an equally systematic understatement of the Conservative one.It is for the pollsters to decide whether to conduct a review of their performance but I trust they will avoid the initial knee-jerk reaction of the immediate aftermath of the 1992 polls debacle.This general election performance follows the performance of the polls in the 2014 Scottish referendum where the choice was simply binary and yet all the polls were out by between 4-6%.Something is wrong. A lot of us would like to know what it is.Read more from David Cowling hereThe words ""political earthquake"" have been translated into numerous European languages, making front page news across the continent.While Britons now examine the domestic minutiae of the election result, here in mainland Europe the vote means one thing: a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU. And that has the potential to create an earthquake of its own.The guardian of the EU treaties Mr Cameron wants to change - Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker - has said again he'd listen to what Britain's new government proposed.Read more from Katya Adler here"

2015-05-11,A history of political plots,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32749971,"Nigel Farage has apparently seen off a challenge to his leadership of UKIP - a move described by his former election strategist as a ""coup"". He's not the only party leader to face an attempted ousting. But can you recover from such a revolt?In 2006, the Labour prime minister was the target of what became known as the ""curry house conspiracy"" - a coup to remove him and install his chancellor, Gordon Brown, as prime minister.It would lead to several of the plotters' resignations - but not Mr Blair's. However, it was successful to a degree in that it forced the party leader into naming a departure date.The move against him was reportedly masterminded by Tom Watson, a defence minister at the time, who was also rumoured to have had a secret meeting with Mr Brown on the eve of the revolt.Apparently, Mr Watson and three fellow West Midlands MPs - Sion Simon, David Wright (both ministerial aides) and Khalid Mahmood - met over a biryani at a Wolverhampton curry house to discuss the PM's future, before dispatching a missive calling for him to quit.The letter - which attracted the support of a number of normally loyal Labour MPs - was leaked to the press, and ultimately resulted in Mr Watson's resignation.In his parting letter, the West Bromwich East MP took a shot at the prime minister, who he said should step down in the interests of party and country.Mr Blair denounced his actions and branded the former minister ""disloyal, discourteous and wrong"", saying he would have sacked him if he had not resigned.But Mr Watson's departure was swiftly followed by the resignations of six other junior members of government - who had also signed the rebel letter - in protest at the prime minister's refusal to say when he would step down as Labour leader.The whole affair resulted in Mr Blair announcing his intention to step aside within 12 months - which he duly did, on 27 June 2007.But it did nothing to quash internal dissent and speculation in the party over the future leadership of the party.Labour prime minister Gordon Brown found his leadership under threat in 2009 after one of his cabinet ministers dramatically quit the government and called for him to resign.Work and Pensions Secretary James Purnell - a former aide to Tony Blair - resigned from his post after the polls closed in the local and European elections, in which Labour was forecast to do badly.Explaining his decision to quit, Mr Purnell said the prime minister made a Conservative victory ""more, not less, likely"".It was Mr Brown's first direct challenge from a cabinet minister - but it would not topple the Labour leader as senior members of government refused to follow Mr Purnell's lead.Mr Brown was safe for the time being. But several months later, in January 2010, a fresh leadership challenge was mounted by two senior former Labour cabinet ministers.Geoff Hoon and Patricia Hewitt wrote to all Labour MPs, saying the party was ""deeply divided"" over Mr Brown's leadership and that the best way to resolve the issue was by way of secret ballot.They insisted it was not an ""attempted coup"" but a necessary step to resolve divisions within the party.But the duo could only muster the public support of a handful of backbenchers long-opposed to Mr Brown, with the majority of the party's MPs less than impressed by the move, which came just weeks before the general election.As the day wore on, a succession of cabinet ministers came out to back the PM, suggesting there was little momentum behind the plot - although it was noted that several were not exactly gushing in their support of Mr Brown.As history tells us, neither leadership challenge bore fruit but they reflected the internal doubts and divisions over Mr Brown at the helm.As leadership toppling attempts go, this one in 2014 was regarded as a particularly ""botched"" and ""shambolic coup"". Indeed, former Lib Dem leader Lord (Paddy) Ashdown described the move as a ""plot of deep malice"".Its instigator, Lord (Matthew) Oakeshott - a close ally of the-then Business Secretary Vince Cable - tried to unseat Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg.The peer was found to have commissioned secret polls suggesting the party would do better at the 2015 general election without Mr Clegg in the driving seat.The man Lord Oakeshott had long had in mind to take Mr Clegg's place - Mr Cable, who was on government business in China at the time - was forced to publicly condemn his friend's actions and state his backing for Mr Clegg.But Lord Oakeshott said the business secretary had in fact known about his polls and their findings.Nevertheless, the peer - who was denounced by the Lib Dem leadership for spending money that could have been spent on campaigning - quit the party, and issued a warning shot on his way out about the Lib Dems' future prospects.Mr Cable largely emerged unscathed but he faced questions about his loyalty to the leader. Although the two sought to put paid to reports of a rift with a (painfully awkward, 'nothing to see here, folks') stage-managed pint in a pub.Although the revolt failed, and Mr Clegg remained at the helm, the Lib Dems did go on to suffer a trouncing at the general election, losing nearly 50 of its MPs - one of them, Mr Cable himself - prompting his leader to quit.The Conservatives have a reputation for being more ruthless than their party rivals when it comes to getting rid of leaders they sense are no longer effectual.But, in 1995, Prime Minister John Major - tired of persistent rumours of a leadership challenge - decided to take the bull by the horns and trigger a surprise leadership election to silence his detractors.His own backbenchers had questioned Mr Major's ability to unite and lead the party, which was deeply divided over Europe.So ""put up or shut up"", he told them as he tendered his resignation as Conservative Party leader but not prime minister.But then stepped forward eurosceptic MP John Redwood, who resigned from the cabinet in order to contest Mr Major's leadership.This was unexpected by many, as the PM had said there had been assurances from his cabinet that none would stand against him.But Mr Major went on to win the ensuing election with a comfortable defeat over his challenger, who was not included in the PM's consequent cabinet reshuffle.No further contested leadership election took place until after the Conservatives' defeat at the 1997 general election, paving the way for William Hague to take over the running of the party.Not all attempts to oust a party leader end in failure: as Margaret Thatcher found out to her peril.With three electoral victories under her belt, the Conservative prime minister's downfall would come at the hands of her own party - not the voters.It was on 1 November 1990 when Geoffrey (now Lord) Howe - one of Mrs Thatcher's longest-serving ministers - resigned over differences with the party leader over Europe.In his now infamous speech on the floor of the House of Commons, he attacked the PM's policies and leadership style, comparing being one of her cabinet ministers to opening the batting at cricket only to find his bat had been ""broken... by the team captain"".It sparked the beginning of the end of the 11-year Thatcher reign.Michael (now Lord) Heseltine seized on the opportunity to challenge the prime minister in the ensuing leadership contest, from which she would eventually withdraw and John Major emerge as her successor. Reflecting on the revolt and its implications on the Conservative Party, Baroness Thatcher's biographer Charles Moore wrote: ""Because the coup was unjustified, and so trust broke down, the politics of the next 15 years were those of civil war."""
2015-05-11,Election swings and roundabouts,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-32741924,"If election manifesto claims are all about smoke and mirrors, should we now add swings and roundabouts to the political metaphor?There's an intriguing aspect to the general election results in the Midlands that puzzled me.It's the striking contrast in the swings between Labour and the Conservatives.David Cameron and his campaign strategists knew they were home and dry when Nuneaton was the first Midlands marginal to declare.It was not only a Tory hold but a swing to the Conservatives from Labour of 3%.I was in the Nottingham suburb of Beeston awaiting the result of the Broxtowe count. Would its high profile Conservative MP Anna Soubry survive a red surge?Nuneaton set the pattern. Across the Midlands, both east and west, there was a uniform swing of between three and four per cent to the Tories - Warwickshire North 3%, Amber Valley 4%, Derbyshire South 4% and Sherwood 4%. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan topped the Tory swingometer in the Midlands marginals with 5% in Loughborough.Yet in the big cities, it was a very different story. The swing went to Labour.So in Nottingham East they enjoyed a 6% swing, Nottingham South 5.8%, Leicester South 7.3%, Leicester West 5%, Birmingham Hall Green 12%, Birmingham Hodge Hill 8%.If swings to Labour on this scale had gone beyond the city ring road roundabouts and into the suburbs, Ed Miliband would have become prime minister by now.In confidence, one senior Labour insider in Nottingham told me its success in the city wards was down to organisation, experience and its teams of activists.""We won the ground war. If Nottingham's city boundaries were extended into Sherwood and Broxtowe, we would have won those constituencies as well,"" he told me.Labour leadership candidate, Leicester West's Liz Kendall has identified her party's problem beyond the ring road roundabout.It's about reaching out to Middle England.""We need to show people that we understand their aspirations and ambitions for the future,"" she told the Sunday Times.The problem for Labour was that Middle England was not interested in what the party offered…and still isn't. The Cameron brand worked its magic in those Midlands marginals... it'll take something or someone special to break up that ballot box relationship."
2015-05-11,Royal 'lobbying',https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32740154,"Prince Charles sent 27 letters to then Prime Minister Tony Blair and members of his government between September 2004 and March 2005, ""despite the Freedom of Information Act!"" as the prince joked in one.But did his suggestions and concerns have any bearing on the behaviour of Mr Blair's government?The request: Prince Charles expresses his worries over an EU directive on complementary medicines ""which is… effectively outlawing the use of certain herbal extracts"".  Mr Blair replied, offering moral support and practical help. He agreed that ""the implementation as it is currently planned is crazy"" and set out an action plan that included delaying implementation for all existing products to 2011. What happened: Herbal products were not required to be authorised until 2011, just as Mr Blair had promised. Prince Charles continues to sell his own brand of complementary products, Duchy Herbals, through Boots and Waitrose. The request: Writing to Mr Blair, the prince expresses a ""growing sense of anxiety"" that the Hill Farming Allowance, which supports farmers working on Britain's uplands, could be scrapped. In his reply, the prime minister said he understood that the Hill Farm Allowance would continue until 2007. What happened: The allowance lasted until the end of Labour's tenure in 2010, when it was abolished.The request: Just 18 months after the US-led invasion of Iraq, Prince Charles raised the issue of poor performance of Lynx helicopters in high temperatures, saying: ""I fear that this is just one more example of where our Armed Forces are being asked to do an extremely challenging job (particularly in Iraq) without the necessary resources.""Mr Blair replied: ""On the subject of the Lynx helicopter, the limitations of the existing platform, particularly in the extremely challenging environment within Iraq, are well recognised by the Ministry of Defence."" He added that replacement of the helicopters would be a priority. What happened: Mr Blair's comments go much further than what he was saying about the subject at the time. In the event, though, the fleet was not fully upgraded until 2011.The request: Prince Charles lamented that the government's TB prevention plans might not ""include a commitment to deal with the badger problem in the immediate future"" and pushed strongly for a cull, saying: ""All I can say is that I do urge you to look again at introducing a proper cull of badgers where it is necessary.""Mr Blair sympathised, saying he could ""personally see the case for culling badgers"". However, he was unwilling to commit to a cull.  What happened: Culling trials were conducted from 1998-2005. The final results, published in 2008, said that the badger cull could ""make no meaningful contribution"" to curbing bovine TB. It wasn't until 2013 that a full culling programme began in two pilot areas. These ended with the conclusion that the pilots had been neither humane nor effective at curbing the spread of TB.The request: Then Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell wrote to Prince Charles to say she had decided to give parts of the historic Smithfield meat market Grade II listed status, and was trying to persuade deputy prime minister John Prescott to ""call in"" the planning application to prevent demolition of other parts of the site. She had been swayed by evidence provided by Sir Neil Cossons, who was English Heritage chair at the time, after he had been asked by the prince to add his support. Prince Charles replied that he was ""extremely glad to read of your appreciation of the value of this group of buildings"". According to the Guardian, market workers desperate to see the redevelopment of the site invited the prince to meet them to discuss it, but his office said he was ""unlikely to accept as he did not want to interfere in the planning process"".What happened: Smithfield market is still the subject of planning battles a decade on. Successive planning applications have been refused by ministers. Last year then Communities Secretary Eric Pickles rejected plans for an office development on the site, stating that ""the extent of damage that the application would cause to the important heritage assets at Smithfield runs entirely counter to national and policy objectives intended to protect such assets from harm"".In March, the Museum of London announced a move from its current Barbican site to the Smithfield market building."
2015-05-11,Election fallout,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32703139,"""Some of those gimmicks - that tombstone, whatever idiot thought that up I do not know!""I was talking to the former Mayor of Crawley in Sussex, John Mortimer, in the town's Labour Supporters Club about the vexed question of what went wrong, and where Labour should go next. This seat is one of those southern seats Labour hoped to take, but failed.I hear a whole range of views in the club.""They didn't give nothing to depend on, they should be clear, and a little bit more down to Earth."" ""Good party, wrong leader, they don't look after business enough.""Councillor John Stanley tells me: ""I think in a way we did go too left, but now we can go a bit centre-left, or centre, depending who the new leader is.""The former mayor sums up the mood on the doorstep: ""Whatever we told them, they didn't believe us.""  Expect to hear all those views, and more, in the coming leadership contest. Step back from the angst of supporters, and it may not be that hard to see why Labour failed.  An economic recovery, hailed by independent organisations as the result of government policy, undid a party that had loudly proclaimed for five years that the coalition's policies would lead to economic disaster. Combine that with an uncharismatic and uninspirational leader, then you might argue no further debate is necessary.Fat chance of that. Defeat breeds resentment, and this one has opened up old divisions.  A chorus of Blairties, led by the man himself, has declared that Ed's problem was ignoring those with aspiration and ambition, failing to appeal to those running business. Incidentally, I've been ticked off by the perspicacious editor of the New Statesman, Jason Cowley, for using the ""unhelpful"" term ""Blairites"".I can't think of another description that fits Tony, Lord Mandelson, Lord Adonis and David Miliband quite so well. But call them what you will, the message was clear - Ed was too left wing, Labour should move back to the centre, or, if you like, to the right.Reading Mr Blair's pithy analysis, listening to Lord Mandelson's gripping and savage eloquence, describing a party sent out to shout: ""We love the poor and hate the rich,"" and so ignoring the middle, and you realise strong emotions are in play.But back to the future may not be sufficient. Of course elections are won on the centre ground. But grandees grinding axes, affronted by the failure of boys who used to make their tea, may be creating so much noise that they can't hear more insistent sounds.  For there are several elephants trumpeting loudly as they cram into the small space of the shadow cabinet room. Imagine these beasts are as gaily decorated as Berlin buddy bears. One is decked out in red, another in imperial purple bunting, and another, a mammoth, strong tusked and ice rimmed, painted yellow with tartan trimmings.Take the last first. The Scottish wipeout is Labour's biggest problem. Fail to solve it, and Labour can forget ever having a comfortable majority again. It is hard to argue Labour were wiped out in Scotland because the SNP outflanked them to the right with their appeal to the business community and the ambitious and aspirational. But it is true the SNP drew in to people from left, right and centre, just as the modernisers say Labour should. It was the politics of economic self-interest, but cast in a very different light. Tribally sneering at ""the reactionary ideology of nationalism"" as Mr Blair does, will not reach the central belt of Scotland, the middle ground of  Midlothian.What about that purple pachyderm?  In Crawley - in fact in seat after seat - there is a similar pattern.  Labour did, in fact, often increase the size of their vote. So did the Conservatives, usually by a bit more. But the real dynamic was the total collapse of the Lib Dems and the dramatic rise of UKIP. The increase in votes for Nigel Farage's party wasn't translated into parliamentary seats, but, although it is early days in terms of research, it probably hurt Labour a lot. If we believe - and I do - Matthew Goodwin and Rob Ford, authors of Revolt on the Right, these voters are often former Labour supporters - older, less educated, those left behind on the tides of  globalisation, stranded on the shores of post-industrialisation. They may have had too many disappointments to feel much ambition or aspiration. They are a challenge for Labour, and any new leader will spend a good deal of time thinking how to deal with the concerns of Europe and immigration.Whether to share their fears, or confront them will be a big decision.Which brings us to Red Nellie. Those members who still proudly call themselves socialist. This is not about Old Labour - they are more likely to be baristas or barristers than boilermakers. It is easy as an outsider, as a journalist, to treat politics as an intellectual game about how best to win power - but many people, particularly the foot soldiers, particularly after the death of  purely tribal loyalties, are in it because they passionately believe in winning  power to do something specific.Many of them are suspicious of the later incarnations of New Labour, not because it reached an accommodation with wealth and business, but because it seemed to worship at the same altar, to regard the party's core beliefs in redistribution and equality as childish fantasies from a past age.Perhaps to Mr Blair, they are the problem, people who may equate ""ambition"" with greed. They might point out that a man who claims to be worth ""only"" £20m may find it harder than most to squeeze through the eye of a needle to understand their point of view. Most successful Labour leaders will confront the left at some point, but the concerns of this group go to the existential question ""What is the party for?""This is not a polemic - not an argument about what should be done, but a reflection on the complex conundrums that will face any new Labour leader, the tearing apart of the old alliance that made up a Labour majority, and so the political need to satisfy groups with very different, indeed, contradictory demands. But looking for a Social Democratic universal theory of everything may be missing the point. What the party desperately wants is a leader who can pull the disparate threads together and articulate them as common purpose. Whether she or he exists is another matter.Much more on that in the coming months."
2015-05-11,'Take us with you',https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-32736153,"Thousands of people in the north of England have been using the hashtag ""take us with you Scotland"" to express their upset about the result of last week's general election, and Scottish nationalists are welcoming this English minority with open arms. Last Thursday's general election was a rough one for the Labour Party in its traditional stronghold in the north of England. But further to the north, the left-leaning Scottish National Party won nearly every seat it contested. That political contrast has made some left-wing voters in places like Manchester, Leeds and Sheffield look fondly on their neighbours. Since last Thursday's election in Britain the phrase ""take us with you Scotland"" has been used more than 24,000 times. ""Genuinely beginning to wonder if the North of England becoming a part of Scotland would be better for us, I really am,"" tweeted Aaron Miller from Yorkshire. Some cracked jokes under the tag after the North West Motorway Police account, which gives traffic updates, announced that they had ""picked up a pedestrian on the M62 who was trying to walk to Scotland.""After an initial spike of jokes over the weekend, the hashtag really took off when users start to mobilise in support of around a year-old petition on the campaigning site Change.org. The petition calls for the north of England to secede from the rest of the country and join up with Scotland, and more than 12,000 people have signed it.Its creator, a Sheffield resident who calls himself ""Stu Dent"", set it up to coincide with last year's Scottish independence referendum, and he also created a map imagining the boundary of a ""Scotland plus the north"" country.Stu Dent runs the Twitter account Hunters Bar, named after an area of southwest Sheffield which is very popular with - you guessed it - students. Despite the account having thousands of followers on Twitter, when the map was first posted last year, the image was shared only about 100 times - however, in the past week it's been retweeted by thousands. Stu Dent told BBC Trending that he was surprised at how popular his idea has become. ""In hindsight, perhaps I shouldn't have been,"" he said. ""There is a huge frustration in parts of the UK about the things that have happened since 2010.""""I think people need a place to go where they can say 'not in my name! This is not the England I want',"" he added. But in addition to disappointment from some quarters about the election result, there might be another reason why the petition is getting a boost now: the power of the Scottish Nationalists on Twitter. What started as a post-election joke in the North of England was quickly embraced by the so-called ""Cyber Nats"" - and a trend was born.The SNP's social media strategist Ross Colquhoun expressed the party's mood about the hashtag best, in a post which was shared more than 500 times. ""2014: #LetsStayTogether 2015: #TakeUsWithYouScotland What a difference a year makes"" he tweeted.Blog by Hannah HendersonNext story: The sport reporter and the obscene ranter who lost his jobFollow BBC Trending on Twitter @BBCtrending, and find us on Facebook."
2015-05-11,What Britain wants from Europe,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32695399,"David Cameron says he has a mandate to pursue EU reform following the Conservatives' general election victory. The PM, who will be hoping his majority government will give him extra leverage in Brussels, wants to renegotiate the terms of the UK's membership ahead of a referendum by the end of 2017. He has said he will campaign for Britain to remain in the EU if he gets the reforms he wants.Mr Cameron has said he does not want to reveal full details of his negotiating hand but he has given a broad indication, in a series of speeches and newspaper articles, of his priorities when he goes into talks with other EU leaders.These are: The prime minister has said Britain would resist any move towards a European Army and that he wants to free British police forces from EU interference. He has also ruled out Britain joining the euro.But he has placed less emphasis in recent years on demanding changes to EU social policy, such as the maximum 48-hour working week, agency workers, maternity leave and non-discrimination rules.The official UK government position is that a referendum will be held by the end of 2017 but Downing Street sources have said: ""If we can do it earlier we will.""There is speculation David Cameron is planning to hold the vote in 2016 to avoid a clash with French and German elections in 2017.The prime minister wants treaty change but even if the referendum was held in 2017 there may not be enough time to legally incorporate any reforms into a treaty and it would have to be done at a later stage.An early referendum would anger Eurosceptics who believe it would not allow enough time to make the case for exit or negotiate any meaningful concessions.""A rushed process would severely undermine the chances to secure a significant deal that both British business and voters could support and would waste the opportunity of a lifetime,"" Matthew Elliott, chief executive of Business for Britain told Breitbart London.The question is always crucial in any referendum and there is already a debate about what it should be. The Draft European Union (Referendum) Bill, published by the Conservatives in 2013, proposed this form of words: ""Do you think that the United Kingdom should remain a member of the European Union?""Some thought that leaned too far towards the status quo, encouraging a yes vote, and the Electoral Commission said it was not clear and direct enough. The watchdog proposed this form of words instead: ""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union?""The new Conservative government will attempt to repeal the Human Rights Act, which requires UK courts to treat the European Court of Human Rights as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. The European Court of Human Rights is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe (CoE), which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine.The freedom for people to move around Europe, enshrined in the EU treaties, works in parallel with the other three basic freedoms in the single market: freedom of goods, capital and services.It is likely to be a ""red line"" for other EU leaders, who do not want to see it eroded.Mr Cameron has steered clear of tackling it directly - for example by asking for an emergency ""brake"" on free movement, or a cap on numbers - focusing instead on reducing the incentive provided by welfare payments. In a speech last November, David Cameron set out measures to reduce the number of EU nationals moving to the UK.His main proposals were:Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission, has said he is ready to work with Mr Cameron to ""strike a fair deal for the United Kingdom in the EU"". The leaders of other EU nations have previously warned they are unlikely to support major changes to EU treaties to accommodate British demands. But Mr Cameron's general election victory may have given him extra leverage. ""The ball is very much in the court of the UK now,"" a senior EU official told The Guardian. ""It's up to the British to define what they want."" The key figure will be German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is very keen to keep Britain in the EU but has so far been unwilling to make major concessions to enable that to happen. There are fears that a ""pick and mix"" approach to EU treaties would undermine EU cohesion.Mr Cameron has said there is ""no doubt"" his planned reforms will require changes to the treaties governing the European Union. But this would require the unanimous support of all EU members, and may not be possible within the deadline he has set of a referendum before the end of 2017. Any attempt to change EU laws on free movement would meet fierce resistance from some EU nations, particularly Eastern European states. Mr Juncker has said free movement is non-negotiable.Mr Cameron may find it difficult to get unanimous support for his proposals for a four-year waiting period for migrant workers claiming UK benefits. East European EU members would be likely to oppose this, on the grounds that it would discriminate against their citizens.  Attempts to secure opt-outs for the City are unlikely to go down well with other European leaders.However, there are precedents for EU treaty changes to accommodate some countries' specific concerns - for example, the protocol attached to the Lisbon Treaty for Ireland.Mr Cameron has faced repeated calls to say whether he would campaign for Britain's exit from the EU in the referendum if he fails to get what he wants from the renegotiation process. All he has said is that he will ""rule nothing out"". Some Conservative MPs want Britain to leave the EU no matter what David Cameron manages to renegotiate. A larger group are likely to want more concessions than Mr Cameron has so far indicated he is prepared to demand.Senior backbencher David Davis, who was defeated by Mr Cameron for the Tory leadership in 2005, told the Daily Telegraph the majority of the 332 Conservative MPs want Mr Cameron to negotiate an ""opt-out"" power to stop individual EU laws from applying to Britain. The prime minister has said this would be ""impossible"" without Britain leaving the EU.Mr Davis claims as many as 60 Tory MPs would be prepared to rebel and vote for Britain's exit from the EU if the prime minister fails to deliver.Graham Brady, chairman of the Tory backbench 1922 committee, which represents backbenchers, has urged David Cameron to give all Conservative MPs, including ministers, a free vote in the EU referendum.In January, Mr Cameron warned that serving cabinet ministers would have to quit the government if they wanted to campaign to leave the EU if he had secured the reforms to it he wants.In the 1975 referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Economic Community, as the EU was then called, Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson decided to suspend collective responsibility because his cabinet was split on the issue. Ministers were allowed to vote with their consciences and campaign against each other. The majority of them, including Mr Wilson, joined the Yes camp, but left-wingers, such as Tony Benn, played a leading role in the No campaign. The Yes campaign won easily with 67% of the vote."

2015-05-12,Scots Labour leader Murphy to resign,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32760196,"Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy is to resign next month, he has announced.It comes despite Mr Murphy narrowly surviving a vote of no confidence at a meeting of the party's national executive in Glasgow. Mr Murphy said he would tender his resignation alongside a plan to reform the party.He lost his seat in last week's general election as the SNP won 56 of the 59 Scottish seats, leaving Labour with a single MP in Scotland.Mr Murphy said he wanted to have a successor as leader in place by the summer, and confirmed he would not be standing for a seat at the Scottish Parliament in next year's election. Instead, he said it was time to ""do something else"" and that he believed the party would continue to be divided if he remained as leader. His deputy, Kezia Dugdale MSP, will become acting leader until a permanent successor is found. Mr Murphy had faced calls to resign from several MSPs, trade unions and former MPs in the wake of his party's near wipeout at the general election.He insisted he had decided to stand down ahead of the national executive voting by 17-14 in favour of him staying in the job.Speaking at a media conference after the national executive meeting, he said: ""It is clear that a small minority who didn't accept my election as leader of the Scottish Labour Party just five months ago won't accept the vote of the executive today and that will continue to divide the party.""Today I received more support in the executive vote than I did from members of the executive when I stood for election five months ago.""He said it would be up to the executive whether to accept the reforms he would be proposing before he left the post. But he warned: ""A party in such urgent need of reform blocks those changes at its peril.""The former East Renfrewshire MP said Labour had been crushed between ""two nationalisms"" in Scotland and England.Mr Murphy said he left no legacy of bitterness for anyone in the Labour Party, and the only person he was angry at was the person who blamed Scottish Labour for the party's UK-wide general election defeat - a reference to Unite leader Len McCluskey.And he said that in many ways Scottish Labour was the ""least modernised part of the Labour movement"" and that he wanted his successor to be elected under a one member, one vote system.Mr Murphy added: ""The Labour Party's problem is not the link with trade unions, or even the relationship with Unite members - far from it. It is the destructive behaviour of one high profile trade unionist.""The leader of the Scottish Labour Party doesn't serve at the grace of Len McCluskey, and the next leader of the UK Labour Party should not be picked by Len McCluskey.""Mr McCluskey has been a vocal critic of Mr Murphy's leadership and opposed his appointment in December when Mr Murphy won the contest to replace Johann Lamont.Jim Murphy laughed and joked with Scottish Labour's sole MP as he made his way down the hotel corridor to announce his resignation.He certainly brought energy and dynamism to his election campaign - but all that achieved was Ian Murray in Edinburgh South.So as Mr Murphy bows out, who could replace him?The deputy leader Kezia Dugdale may want to step up or Neil Findlay could try again after challenging last time. Maybe the party's finance spokeswoman Jackie Baillie thinks her steady hand could steer the ship.Jenny Marra is also often talked about as future face of the party.Whoever steps into Jim Murphy's red shoes he or she will have to face a difficult 2016 Holyrood election, to put it mildly.There are also more fundamental questions about how the party can possibly move on as it faces a surging SNP.Mr Murphy was very much a creature of ""New Labour"" - but to today's generation that's old Labour.Party members may start looking for someone with no links to the past, neither a Brownite nor a Blairite. A 'cleanskin' - as the politicos put it - may well help re-connect with voters.That's a long way from now though - even some of the party's opponents may view this latest train wreck with a modicum of sympathy. Ms Lamont had resigned after claiming Scottish Labour was treated like a ""branch office"" by the London-based party leadership.Mr Murphy concluded his speech by saying: ""Scotland needs a strong Labour party; Scotland needs a united Labour party. We have been the greatest force for change in our nation's remarkable history. ""The Scottish Labour party will rise again. It will be under someone else's leadership and I am confident about my party's future.""Harriet Harman MP, acting leader of the UK Labour Party, said it would be for Scottish Labour to choose a new leader. She added: ""As a cabinet minister and leader of his party in Scotland, Jim has been a hugely important figure in the Labour Party. He leaves with the best wishes and thanks of our movement.""Labour peer Lord McConnell, a former Scottish first minister, said the party's problems were ""much deeper than one individual and one affiliate"".He said: ""We have a disconnect locally and nationally with wider Scottish society. ""We have a problem with our political positioning in the post devolution age where the party particularly at the UK level has never been comfortable with success in the Scottish parliament and has always tried to see things through a UK prism rather than a Scottish prism.""We need to find a new generation, a new leader, new generation, new ideas, a fresh approach.""In a tweet, Scottish first minister and SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said: ""I wish Jim Murphy all the very best for the future. Leadership is not easy and he deserves credit for standing up for what he believes in.""Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson also reacted on Twitter, saying: ""Jim Murphy announces a managed exit in order to help the party, which is to his credit. But leaves a tough gig for whoever comes next.""The meeting of Scottish Labour's executive was disrupted by protesters who entered the party's headquarters.Police were called and the protesters, who included persistent anti-austerity activists Sean Clerkin and Piers Doughty-Brown, left the building to protest further from the street outside.The protesters were calling for Mr Murphy to remain as leader to ""finish the job of destroying Scottish Labour"".A Police Scotland spokeswoman said officers had been called and found two protestors on the third floor of the building. She added: ""Both left on police arrival. Advice and assistance was given."""
2015-05-12,Labour contenders clash on spending,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32761561,"Prospective Labour leaders have clashed over Labour's record in government in their first public debate in the race to succeed Ed Miliband.Former cabinet ministers including Yvette Cooper and Andy Burnham defended Labour's fiscal record and spending on schools and hospitals.However, candidates from the 2010 intake of MPs argued that the party spent too much while in office.The debate followed Chuka Umunna's withdrawal from the leadership contest.The remaining candidates appeared at the annual conference of the Progress think tank in London.There was agreement that Labour needed to demonstrate economic credibility to regain power, with shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt telling the meeting that the party needed to be ""trusted with public finances and the family finances"".Mr Hunt, who was first elected to Parliament in 2010 when Labour lost power, argued the last Labour government ""spent too much"" and failed to ""leave enough economic headroom to deal with the economic crisis and the recession"".Shadow health minister Liz Kendall said: ""There's absolutely nothing progressive about spending more on debt interest payments than on educating our children.""But shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: ""The Tories have had a triumph of spin over the facts in saying what they said about the economic record of the last Labour government.""The former chief secretary to the Treasury said the deficit did ""grow too large"" in the government's later years but insisted: ""The last Labour government ran more surpluses in its first term than the Tories did in 18 years.""Yvette Cooper, another former chief secretary to the Treasury, said: ""We should never let anybody tell us that it was too many teachers, doctors or nurses that caused Lehman Brothers bank in New York to crash.""Shadow international development secretary Mary Creagh said: ""People have forgotten the economic credibility that the last Labour government had.""She said Labour had built schools and hospitals that were ""treasured in our communities"".Ms Cooper, Mr Burnham, Ms Kendall and Ms Creagh have declared their intention to run for leader, while Mr Hunt told the conference he would make an announcement next week.At the same event, shadow energy secretary Caroline Flint announced she would be running for deputy leader.The Don Valley MP told the Today programme ahead of the debate that Labour lost the election because ""fundamentally the public did not trust us on the economy"".Exeter MP Ben Bradshaw has already announced a bid to be deputy, saying Labour ""must and could win the next election"", but only if it ""broadens its appeal by adopting sensible, centre-left politics which celebrate wealth creation and entrepreneurship"".Former Labour campaign co-ordinator Tom Watson is reported to be crowd-funding a deputy leadership bid, while Walthamstow MP Stella Creasy has said she is ""open to the question"" of running.Barnsley East MP and shadow transport secretary Michael Dugher - a fierce critic of Ed Miliband's election campaign - is to run Mr Burnham's campaign, according to the website LabourList.It is reported that Mr Burnham also has the backing of Labour peer Lord Falconer, who was lord chancellor and justice secretary under Tony Blair and was close to the former PM.Shadow culture secretary Chris Bryant has signalled his backing for Ms Cooper, tweeting that the next leader must be ""someone who's been tried in the fiery furnace of public opinion"".Mr Hunt said on Friday he would be be attending the debate - along with the other four hopefuls - to ""set out my analysis on how we begin to understand what went so wrong and why"".He added: ""We must use this leadership election to ask some very profound questions.""All voices in the party must be heard so that we can have a full and proper assessment as to why the politics of nationalism triumphed in Scotland and huge swathes of England, and how we have allowed the Conservative Party to present a more compelling vision for Britain to so many millions of people.""Speculation still surrounds shadow business secretary Mr Umunna's decision to pull out on Friday, when he said he was not ""comfortable"" with the ""pressure"" of being a candidate.As well as citing extensive pressure and scrutiny Mr Umunna also said he was ruling himself out because of concerns about the impact of the bid on his family.A rising star of the party, Mr Umunna was first elected to Parliament in 2010 - alongside Tristram Hunt and Liz Kendall - before joining the shadow cabinet.Asked about the candidate who might win, Conservative Chancellor George Osborne said: ""The Labour leadership contest has descended into farce.""But it's not actually about personalities. I don't think the Labour Party any more represents the working people of this country who aspire to a better life."""
2015-05-12,Carswell clarifies comments on Farage,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32771030,"Nigel Farage should take a break ""as leader"" of UKIP but not a break from being leader, the party's only MP says.Douglas Carswell also told the BBC's Sunday Politics that the party needed to ensure it got the ""tone"" right in order to attract more voters.It comes after Mr Carswell said in an article in the Times on Saturday that Mr Farage ""needs to take a break now"".A bitter internal row has developed within UKIP after Mr Farage's resignation was rejected by the party.Mr Carswell said: ""I'm suggesting he takes a break as leader. I'm not suggesting he takes a break from being leader.""Clearly the national executive has the authority, they're the ruling body. ""I'm told that they made a decision. I'm told it was a procedurally correct decision, he is the leader but I think it's important that as leader he takes a break and I think it's important that we work out how these complex questions are answered by a team.""No one person has all the answers. I'm particularly concerned about tone, making sure we get a tone that ensures that the 27 million people who didn't vote for UKIP last week may be persuaded to vote for us in future.""The party has been beset by wrangling since Mr Farage agreed to stay on as leader, days after standing down after failing to get elected in Thanet South.He had pledged before the general election that he would quit the post if he failed to get elected to Parliament.Senior aide Matthew Richardson has left the party, following claims from MEP Patrick O'Flynn that Mr Farage had fallen under the influence of ""inexperienced"" advisers.UKIP has also confirmed the departure of Mr Farage's chief of staff Raheem Kassam.Mr Farage ruled out quitting as leader on BBC's Question Time on Thursday, saying he had ""phenomenal"" support, and has challenged his critics to decide whether they want to stay in the party.In his article, Mr Carswell had said that ""knowing how difficult it is to lead a party makes me admire Nigel Farage all the more"".""I know that I never could,"" he added, stressing that he would find it ""impossible to simultaneously lead UKIP, be the voice of the party in the Commons, represent my Clacton constituents and at the same time be a husband and a dad"".However, he said that ""even leaders need to take a break"", adding: ""Nigel needs to take a break now.""UKIP got nearly four million votes at the election, but returned only one MP - former Conservative Mr Carswell in the Clacton constituency."
2015-05-12,Coasting schools 'must improve',https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/education-32763097,"Education Secretary Nicky Morgan has said new powers to sack head teachers in coasting schools will show ""it is not OK to be just above the level of failing"". Under the plans, ministers could force schools rated as ""requiring improvement"" and missing new government benchmarks to become an academy.Coasting schools have average results which have often flatlined over time.Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, Mrs Morgan said faster action was needed.She said: ""Our big priorities will be to speed up the process for tackling failing schools; extend our academies programme to tackle 'coasting' schools; and deliver on our commitment to open new free schools.""The proposals will be in a new bill due to be introduced in the Queen's Speech. ""First, we will take new powers to step in from the moment that a school is found to be failing,"" Mrs Morgan said.""From day one, regional schools commissioners will be able to bring in new leadership and support from other excellent schools and heads, and we will speed up the process of turning schools into academies to make sure that new expert leadership is found for all schools that need it as quickly as possible.""She said that coasting schools will be put on an immediate notice to improve and could then be taken over and turned into an academy.They will be required to work with a team of ""expert"" head teachers.She said: ""Those that aren't able to demonstrate a clear plan for improvement will be given new leadership - we know this works in turning schools around.""More than 3,300 schools in England are labelled ""requires improvement"", but the plans are unlikely to cover that many schools.Under the current system, secondary schools are considered to be failing, and therefore eligible for intervention, if fewer than 40% of their students score at least five Cs at GCSE, including English and maths, and they do not meet national averages in pupil progress.In primary schools, the threshold for intervention is if fewer than 65% of pupils get Level 4 in reading, writing and maths and a below average number of pupils make the expected amount of progress.It is not yet clear how coasting schools will be deemed in need of intervention.It is understood that a new category will be devised covering schools which are rated as ""requires improvement"" and which fail to meet a new set of standards on improvement."
2015-05-12,Co-op Group to keep political funding,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-32762858,"The Co-operative Group has decided to continue financially supporting the Co-operative Party, which has strong ties to Labour.Members of the group, the UK's biggest mutual organisation, voted on the issue at their annual general meeting.They passed a motion by 48,579 for, to 39,479 against, to approve ""political expenditures"" of up to £1m which support the movement's objectives.Last year the Co-op Group gave £625,000 to the Co-op Party.This figure was down on the sums donated in previous years. The AGM also included a vote on new corporate governance procedures which would mean members having less of a direct say.The Co-operative Group is still recovering from a period of financial mismanagement and some members have recently expressed concerns about how elections to the board are chosen.The banking arm of the group came close to collapse in 2013, bringing the whole group to a £2.5bn annual loss that year. The Co-op Party includes among its members a number of Labour MPs, including shadow chancellor Chris Leslie and Walthamstow MP Stella Creasy. The politicians stand as candidates of both the Co-operative Party and the Labour Party, and the two political movements have strong historical ties. The board asked the members of the Co-operative Group whether they wanted to continue financially supporting the Co-operative Party, or any other party. Allan Leighton, chairman of the Co-op Group, said: ""There's a clear remit from the members to continue to support the Labour Party.""It allows us to now have a conversation with the Co-op Labour Party about what we do next.""There was also a members' motion on the agenda, put forward by those in favour of making political donations of up to £1m a year.The motion to approve political funding ""not to exceed £1m per annum"" was carried by 55.17% to 44.83%.BBC business correspondent Joe Lynam said: ""To meet a £1.5bn hole in its accounts - mostly stemming from its banking division - the Co-op Group has had to sell off parts of its businesses and hand over majority control of its bank to American hedge funds.""It's also in the process of radically changing the way it runs itself into a more corporate structure with less of a direct say by its members.""He said that ""in theory"", each of the 2.8 million Co-op members could vote on a series of motions about the reforms, as well as how its bosses are paid, and retaining the links to the Co-operative party.One of the group's largest independent societies, Midcounties, recently threatened legal action over a shortlist of six candidates for the group's board being reduced to three - the number of positions available - before a member vote.

2015-05-12,Osborne plans July 'stability' Budget,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32761566,"Chancellor George Osborne has said that he will deliver a new Budget on 8 July.He claimed it would have ""a laser-like focus"" on raising productivity and living standards.He said he was making the unusual move of having a second Budget in one year in order to ""deliver on the commitments we have made to working people"".Labour said the chancellor would have to set out ""who is going to pay"" for what it called ""uncosted promises"" in the election campaign.Speaking outside 11 Downing Street, the chancellor gave a broad outline of his plans for the forthcoming Budget but refused to be drawn on the details, including the Conservatives' planned £12bn of welfare cuts.""I don't want to wait to deliver on the commitments we have made to working people,"" he said.""It will continue with the balanced plan we have to deal with our debts, invest in our health service and reform welfare to make work pay.""But there will also be a laser-like focus on making our economy more productive so we raise living standards across our country.""We're going to put Britain into good shape for the long term.""The last Budget was held on 18 March and included tax cuts for first-time house buyers.Writing in the Sun, Mr Osborne admitted it was ""unusual"" to have two Budgets in the same year, but he wanted to turn ""promises made in the election into a reality"".Again, Mr Osborne did not specifically outline how the Conservatives plan to fulfil a pledge to cut £12bn in welfare spending but said he wants to make the welfare system ""fair for the people who pay for it"".He writes: ""We will protect the NHS and give it more funding each and every year, while making savings across Whitehall. ""We'll crack down hard on tax avoidance and aggressive tax planning by the rich - because everyone should pay their fair share.  ""We will always protect the most vulnerable, but we also need a welfare system that's fair to the people who pay for it. If you can work you should be working, so we'll take the next steps in our benefit reforms to make sure that happens.""Second, we've got to go on helping businesses create jobs in Britain, so we move towards full employment. That means facing a hard truth: in Britain we produce about a quarter less for every hour we work than countries like America or Germany. Fixing that long-running productivity weakness is the big challenge for the next five years.""So in the Budget we'll spend less on welfare, and instead invest to create three million more apprenticeships, so that young people can learn a trade, get better jobs and earn more.""After the Budget in March independent forecaster the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said that Mr Osborne needed to spell out exactly how he plans to cut £12bn from welfare spending.Of those £12bn planned cuts, £2bn were outlined ahead of the general election - all the cuts are supposed to be in place by 2017-18.Labour's shadow energy and climate change secretary, Caroline Flint, accused the Tories of making ""a number of uncosted promises"" during the election campaign.She told the BBC: ""It will be interesting to see who is going to pay for those uncosted policies when they bring the Budget in July."""

If it isn't, stop it and do something else.""He also criticised Mr Farage's comments about HIV patients during the TV leaders' debate last month.While debating about the NHS, Mr Farage said: ""You can come into Britain from anywhere in the world and get diagnosed with HIV and get the retro-viral drugs that cost up to £25,000 per year per patient.""Mr Carswell wrote: ""By all means we should highlight the problem of health tourism. But we need to admit that using the example of HIV patients to make the point was ill-advised.""He said the party needed to strike ""the right tone"" and added: ""UKIP has been at its most persuasive when we have been most optimistic.""Anger is never a great way to motivate people - at least not for very long.""The party has been beset by wrangling since Mr Farage agreed to stay on as leader, days after standing down after failing to get elected in Thanet South.He had pledged before the general election that he would quit the post if he failed to get elected to Parliament.Matthew Richardson has left the party, following claims from MEP Patrick O'Flynn that Mr Farage had fallen under the influence of ""inexperienced"" advisers.

They absolutely loved how he helped them and he was a highly-regarded local MP,"" Mr Bone said.""He stood up for what was right rather than what the party line was. In those days - the John Major years - it was much more difficult to stand up against the party machine. He had strong views on Europe.""Sir Peter started his career as an insurance broker, joining the Wycombe Young Conservatives in 1949 and the Oxford University Conservative Association in 1951.He went on to become a Conservative councillor on Buckinghamshire County Council between 1961 and 1967.Wellingborough mayor-elect Barry Graves also paid tribute to Sir Peter, remembering him as a ""very strong constituency MP"".""I remember going out and canvassing with him and he would go everywhere. He knew the area and the people. He was very much a man of the local constituency.""He was ""a very approachable man"", Mr Graves added.Sir Peter was knighted in 1994. "

2015-05-12,PM will 'look at' powers proposals,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32746049,"David Cameron has said he would ""look at"" any proposals for further powers for Scotland but wants to get the Smith Commission plans implemented first.The prime minister was speaking after meeting Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon in Edinburgh.Mr Cameron said he made a ""commitment"" to include a devolution bill in the Queen's Speech later this month.Ms Sturgeon argued the Smith Commission proposals were ""a good starting point"" but did not go far enough.The prime minister has pledged to include a bill on devolution in this month's Queen's Speech which would be based on the cross-party Smith Commission agreement. The Smith proposals included giving Holyrood the power to set income tax rates and bands, as well as control over a share of VAT and some welfare benefits. But Ms Sturgeon's SNP also wants the Scottish Parliament to be given powers over business taxes, employment law, the minimum wage and additional powers over welfare.Speaking after meeting Ms Sturgeon, Mr Cameron told the BBC: ""Let's make sure Smith is implemented in full. I'm going to keep the commitment I made to the people of Scotland. Let's get that done first because it does create a really strong Scottish Parliament.""He added: ""Of course, if people want to make future proposals I'll look at them.""The prime minister again said he did not support full fiscal autonomy for Scotland - the responsibility for all areas of tax and spending except defence and foreign affairs - stating that it would mean £7bn of cuts or extra tax-raising.What Nicola Sturgeon is trying to say is she has a mandate. She has 56 out of the 59 MPs elected in Scotland and she won 50% of the vote - unprecedented here in Scotland.She says that gives her leverage to push David Cameron. David Cameron says he wants to keep the nation together.The language coming out of Westminster last week was very much a cordial one. 'We will listen'.Nicola Sturgeon has warned him that if he doesn't listen, then the people of Scotland will judge him accordingly.Ms  Sturgeon described the hour-long talks at her official residence at Bute House as ""constructive and business-like"". She said Mr Cameron had made a ""commitment"" that the Smith proposals would be implemented ""as agreed"".""But secondly the prime minister agreed that he would look at proposals that we would now send to suggest the areas we can go beyond Smith,"" Ms Sturgeon said.""There was no agreement in terms of the substance of that but we will submit those proposals, the prime minister has said they will consider them and there will be a meeting to look at how we take that further forward.""Referring to her party's success in last week's general election, which saw the SNP win 56 out of 59 Scottish seats, Ms Sturgeon said: ""People in Scotland have now voted fairly convincingly for the SNP and sent a message that we want the Smith Commission proposals to go further and be built on.""The ball is in his court but I'm going into this in good faith.""She added: ""David Cameron and I are a world apart politically but, where we can, I'm determined to do business in the interests of the people of Scotland and across the UK.""She said she would have a ""constructive and business-like"" relationship with the prime minister. The two leaders shook hands on the front steps of Bute House as Mr Cameron arrived. Mr Cameron left the building shortly before 11:00, almost an hour after he had arrived.The two sides agreed to hold more regular discussions in the future, possibly quarterly. "
2015-05-12,Umunna withdraws Labour leader bid,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32748106,"Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna has withdrawn from the Labour party leadership contest, just days after throwing his hat into the ring.The MP, 36, said in a statement that he was not comfortable with the level of pressure and scrutiny that came with being a leadership candidate.Mr Umunna also cited concerns about the impact of the bid on his family.BBC political editor Nick Robinson said the MP's team insisted no ""unwelcome press story"" lay behind the move.But Mr Umunna had been shocked by the level of scrutiny of himself, his mother, sister and girlfriend, he said.You can follow the latest reaction here.A rising star of the party, Mr Umunna was first elected to Parliament in 2010 before joining the shadow cabinet.He confirmed his candidacy for the Labour leadership via a post on his Facebook page on 12 May, saying the party under Ed Miliband had failed to appeal to enough voters in England.But on Friday he said he had not found the leadership bid to be ""a comfortable experience"".I understand that Chuka Umunna has told friends that ""this is not right for me or people close to me. I'm human, the rest of my life is more important to me than politics.""The shadow business secretary has been distressed by the degree of scrutiny he, his family and his girlfriend have come under since he declared his intention to stand for the labour leadership.I am told that this includes reporters waiting outside the houses of relatives late at night.Friends of Mr Umunna deny that he is nervous of not getting the support of enough MPs to run for the leadership; they point out that he already has half the necessary names and that there are some weeks to go.The shadow business secretary now wants to play a leading role in arguing that Britain should stay in the EU and does not rule out seeking the leadership in the future.He said he thought he had understood ""the scrutiny and attention a leadership contest would bring"", but added: ""However, since the night of our defeat last week I have been subject to the added level of pressure that comes with being a leadership candidate.""The shadow business secretary said he had wondered if it was too soon for him to stand for the leadership, and ""I fear it was."" He also cited concerns about the impact on ""the rest of one's life"" and those close to him.""Consequently, after further reflection, I am withdrawing my candidacy,"" he said.Mr Umunna said he would continue to serve as shadow business secretary and hoped to ""play a leading role"" in Labour's campaign to keep the UK in the EU during the forthcoming in/out referendum.Commenting on the news, Labour former culture secretary Ben Bradshaw - who is expected to run for deputy leader - said Mr Umunna was a ""terrible loss"" to the field.He told the BBC's Daily Politics the Streatham MP had been the candidate the Conservative Party ""feared the most"".""And if it's the result of pressure on an extended family or an extended group of friends, I think that's a very sad reflection on our political culture,"" he said.Chuka Umunna feels ""liberated"", he told me, by his decision to quit the Labour leadership race.He hopes to be given a good role (shadow chancellor, I wonder?) by whoever becomes Labour leader. And I expect he'll become very high profile in the campaign to keep Britain in Europe, which is increasingly looking like it will be next May.He'll endorse a candidate in the next four weeks before nominations close. It will be very interesting to see who he piles in behind.Read more from Allegra (see post 13.23).Former Labour leader Lord Kinnock said he thought Mr Umunna had made the right decision.He said: ""If he felt in his soul that he wasn't prepared to subject himself - and more importantly his family - to the kind of attention which is fairly typical, sadly, these days, he has done absolutely the right thing.""There is no point at all in inflicting avoidable, unnecessary misery on those you love most.""Leadership contender Mary Creagh said she had ""huge respect"" for Mr Umunna, telling BBC Radio 4's World at One programme it took ""courage"" to withdraw from the leadership race.Mr Umunna was ""a big beast"" and would play a ""big role"" in the future of the Labour Party, she added.Yvette Cooper, Andy Burnham, Liz Kendall and Mary Creagh have already thrown their hats into the ring for Labour's top job while a number of other potential candidates, including Dan Jarvis, Alan Johnson and David Lammy, have ruled themselves out. Candidates must secure nominations from 34 colleagues - 15% of the party's MPs - by 15 June to make it on to ballot papers, which will be sent to members in August ahead of the leader's election a month later."

However, Mr Justice Stuart Smith at Southwark Crown Court said there was a ""very strong likelihood"" a custodial sentence would follow.The jury heard how Mote submitted numerous false expenses claims for payment for work that organisations had allegedly carried out on his behalf.Mote claimed the money was to pay whistleblowers in cash through third parties. He also said he had been ""targeted for being an anti-EU MEP.""During his time an MEP he also made £250,000 legitimate expenses claims.No date has been set for the sentencing."

Governing parties don't gain seats. Parties that have implemented painful cuts and are promising more certainly don't. Until that is the Conservative Party did - achieving what had seemed to be Mission Impossible - a Tory majority.Until that is David Cameron's personal triumph which triggered the near simultaneous resignation of his three principal opponents - Messrs Miliband, Clegg and Farage.   They did so in part because they helped to crush their partners in coalition these last five years - reducing the Liberal Democrat parliamentary party to a size when it can fit into two London taxis and still have two seats to spare. In part because the extraordinary tidal wave of support for the SNP swept dozens of once safe Labour seats away.In part because Nigel Farage persuaded millions to vote for him but secured just one seat - not, though, the one he was standing in.But - and this is critical - because Labour performed worse overall than it had under Gordon Brown in the immediate aftermath of the worst financial crisis of modern times.

2015-05-12,Round-up: BBC experts' analysis,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/election-2015-32650417,"The political future of the United Kingdom has become clearer after the results of the general election emerged around the country.David Cameron says he hopes to govern for all of the UK after the Conservatives took 331 seats - enough to form a slender majority in the Commons.Labour has been all but wiped out by the SNP in Scotland and suffered a disappointing set of results elsewhere, while the Lib Dems are left with just eight MPs after many party heavyweights such as Vince Cable and Danny Alexander lost their seats.So with battles won and lost and the fall-out and celebrations beginning, BBC correspondents examine the implications and challenges that lie ahead for the new government - and for those whose political careers have been ended by voters.No pollster, no pundit, no political leader saw it coming - not even David Cameron himself.Governing parties don't gain seats. Parties that have implemented painful cuts and are promising more certainly don't. Until that is the Conservative Party did - achieving what had seemed to be Mission Impossible - a Tory majority.Until that is David Cameron's personal triumph which triggered the near simultaneous resignation of his three principle opponents - Messrs Miliband, Clegg and Farage.They did so in part because they helped to crush their partners in coalition these last five years - reducing the Liberal Democrat parliamentary party to a size when it can fit into two London taxis and still have two seats to spare.In part because the extraordinary tidal wave of support for the SNP swept dozens of once safe Labour seats away.In part because Nigel Farage persuaded millions to vote for him but secured just one seat - not, though, the one he was standing in.Read more from Nick Robinson hereThe question uppermost in the prime minister's mind as he assembles his new government is how to keep the kingdom united.""Above all I want to bring our country together,"" he revealed after the result, ""to reclaim a mantle we should never have lost - the mantle of one nation, one United Kingdom"".Looking at the political landscape from Land's End today is very different to the view from John O'Groats.A sea of Conservative and Unionist blue dominates the scene across much of England, while a field of SNP nationalist yellow stretches to the horizon and beyond from the north.David Cameron's greatest challenge is to prevent the union he supports being torn apart by mutual resentment - resentment from Scotland at a Westminster government dominated by English Tories, and resentment from England at the preferential treatment people think is being given to the Scots.Those who assumed the future of the Union had been safeguarded by the Scottish referendum must think again.Read more from Mark Easton hereOne thing is rock-solid true: the Conservatives who worked on this campaign are as surprised by the result as the pollsters, pundits, politicians and general population.Maybe they shouldn't be - the economy is in good shape and the Conservatives had incumbency advantage.But when I travelled back from the prime minister's last rally with a group of exhausted Conservative campaign officials it was clear that 290 seats was a hoped-for target.No-one talked about anything over 300 seats, and no-one even mentioned an overall majority.So what special sauce pushed David Cameron into No 10 with a Commons majority?Mr Cameron had two simple messages in the campaign and he rarely veered away from them; the first - the economy is in good shape and the recovery is threatened by Labour. And the second - the SNP would hold a Labour-led government to ransom.Read more from Jonny Dymond hereBrian Taylor, BBC political editor, ScotlandOf all the comments on the overnight apocalypse, undoubtedly the most straightforward came from a defeated Scottish Labour MP.Since there were quite a few of them, let me narrow the focus a little. Come on down, Tom Harris.Mr Harris had plainly anticipated defeat. Nonetheless, he looked suitably lugubrious as his fate was confirmed.Why, he was asked eagerly, had Labour lost? ""Because we did not win enough votes.""Psephologically, it is perfect. Complete in itself. Psychologically, it sums up Labour's gloom without descending into subsidiary matters such as leadership, strategy and the rest. As a forward-thinking strategy, it is ideal. Win more votes. Simple.Read more from Brian Taylor hereThis has been an election which may have more profound consequences than almost any in living memory.We now face a generational decision about our future in Europe, with an EU referendum in two years' time almost certain.There will also be serious questions about the future of the Union, following an SNP landslide that has turned Scotland into a virtual one-party state.David Cameron's victory also represents a colossal achievement.Only once before in recent history has an incumbent government increased its majority - and that was Mrs Thatcher in her prime in the 1980s.It is also a significant personal victory for Mr Cameron and a rebuff for those in his party who had become increasingly sceptical about his ability to win.But while it may represent a defeat for those Tories who saw this election as a potential opportunity to rid themselves of David Cameron, he must now govern with a wafer-thin majority.For the SNP, their stunning victory can only increase the pressure on Nicola Sturgeon to include a commitment to a second independence referendum in her party's manifesto for next year's Scottish elections.It is an election which has not just defied all the predictions of the pollsters and pundits - but which may yet prompt the most fundamental re-casting of British politics for a generation.Read more from Norman Smith hereAfter an extraordinary night, some brief conclusions:Read more from James Landale hereIs this the end of the union?That is the question many people will be asking this morning after the party which has fought for Scottish independence for 80 years swept to victory.The answer from the jubilant Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon is a firm ""No"".She insists that her MPs will speak for all of Scotland, not just for the 45% who voted for the country to leave the United Kingdom last September.In the closing hours of the most extraordinary election campaign which anyone in Scotland can remember, Ms Sturgeon turned to talk of ""legitimacy.""That will be her watchword in the coming days as she argues that the prime minister cannot ignore the democratic will of the Scottish people.Politically, Scotland and England this morning look and feel like very different countries.Read more from James Cook hereAfter weeks of chatter about an election too close to call, it wasn't that close at all.David Cameron will be continuing as our prime minister.So, what is all this likely to mean?A referendum on whether the UK stays in, or leaves, the European Union, within the next two-and-a-half years.A race to be the next leader of the Labour Party.A race to be the next leader of the Liberal Democrats.And a huge new presence of Scottish National Party MPs at Westminster.And so here's another thing we know for certain this morning: Politics ain't going to be boring any time soon.Read more from Chris Mason hereFor Labour the story of their terrible night is rapidly turning into the search for a new leader. So who will that be?Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, is almost certain to run.  Even before this election, both he and another almost inevitable candidate, Chuka Umunna, had raised eyebrows inside the party at the work they had put in, preparing the ground with members and the unions for potential bids.Yvette Cooper, before the election, was still thought not to have made up her mind over whether to run. That decision has been made perhaps a little easier as her husband, Ed Balls, has lost his seat.She is certainly potentially in the frame, along with two lesser known names - Liz Kendall and Dan Jarvis - two MPs who were only elected in 2010 for the first time. This could be their moment. But whoever is in the job, they face a monumental task.Read Laura Kuenssberg's Twitter hereSterling is up (the most for seven years against the euro), share prices are up (especially bank shares like Lloyds and RBS, and energy shares such as Centrica), government bond prices are up.To state the obvious, investors love the Tories' general election victory.There are a few reasons.One (no surprise here) is that Labour's threat of breaking up banks and imposing energy price caps has been lifted.Second is that investors have been discounting days and weeks of wrangling after polling day over who would form the government - and so they are semi-euphoric that we already know who's in charge.Third, many investors tend to be economically conservative and instinctively Conservative.But although the City may be a bit drunk on the result, its pleasure in Ed Miliband's and Ed Balls' humiliation may be making it a bit blind - perhaps dangerously so - to some bumps in the economic road ahead.Read more from Robert Peston hereNigel Farage dreamed of holding the balance of power, but in the end his UKIP party is now worse off than when it came into the election.At the seventh time of asking he was rejected - this time by the people of Thanet South. It was a similar story in Rochester and Strood where Mark Reckless, who sensationally defected from the Tories last year, was also sent packing.In seats on UKIP's target list, like Thurrock in Essex, the party failed to make gains. In Grimsby - where Mr Farage went twice in the last six weeks - they came third.UKIP got around four million votes - with especially strong showings in north-east and south-east England - but it's ended up with just one MP, and a vacancy at the top. This has led to UKIP attacking the current system of choosing MPs, which it's described as ""busted"" and ""dysfunctional"".In one sense, this campaign was a complete failure and it's left an aftermath of angry voters, and others wondering if the UKIP bubble has burst.Read Robin Brant's Twitter hereI monitored 91 GB-wide voting intention polls during the 2015 election campaign and found nothing in them to prepare me for the final outcome.The good news for the pollsters was that their share for the Lib Dems was pretty close, as were the shares for UKIP, the Greens and the catch-all category of Others.The bad news for the polling industry was that the crucial shares for Conservative and Labour were the ones where they came most adrift.When all the qualifications of margins of error are allowed, there did appear to be a systematic overstatement of the Labour share and an equally systematic understatement of the Conservative one.It is for the pollsters to decide whether to conduct a review of their performance but I trust they will avoid the initial knee-jerk reaction of the immediate aftermath of the 1992 polls debacle.This general election performance follows the performance of the polls in the 2014 Scottish referendum where the choice was simply binary and yet all the polls were out by between 4-6%.Something is wrong. A lot of us would like to know what it is.Read more from David Cowling hereThe words ""political earthquake"" have been translated into numerous European languages, making front page news across the continent.While Britons now examine the domestic minutiae of the election result, here in mainland Europe the vote means one thing: a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU. And that has the potential to create an earthquake of its own.The guardian of the EU treaties Mr Cameron wants to change - Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker - has said again he'd listen to what Britain's new government proposed.Read more from Katya Adler here"

2015-05-12,A history of political plots,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32749971,"Nigel Farage has apparently seen off a challenge to his leadership of UKIP - a move described by his former election strategist as a ""coup"". He's not the only party leader to face an attempted ousting. But can you recover from such a revolt?In 2006, the Labour prime minister was the target of what became known as the ""curry house conspiracy"" - a coup to remove him and install his chancellor, Gordon Brown, as prime minister.It would lead to several of the plotters' resignations - but not Mr Blair's. However, it was successful to a degree in that it forced the party leader into naming a departure date.The move against him was reportedly masterminded by Tom Watson, a defence minister at the time, who was also rumoured to have had a secret meeting with Mr Brown on the eve of the revolt.Apparently, Mr Watson and three fellow West Midlands MPs - Sion Simon, David Wright (both ministerial aides) and Khalid Mahmood - met over a biryani at a Wolverhampton curry house to discuss the PM's future, before dispatching a missive calling for him to quit.The letter - which attracted the support of a number of normally loyal Labour MPs - was leaked to the press, and ultimately resulted in Mr Watson's resignation.In his parting letter, the West Bromwich East MP took a shot at the prime minister, who he said should step down in the interests of party and country.Mr Blair denounced his actions and branded the former minister ""disloyal, discourteous and wrong"", saying he would have sacked him if he had not resigned.But Mr Watson's departure was swiftly followed by the resignations of six other junior members of government - who had also signed the rebel letter - in protest at the prime minister's refusal to say when he would step down as Labour leader.The whole affair resulted in Mr Blair announcing his intention to step aside within 12 months - which he duly did, on 27 June 2007.But it did nothing to quash internal dissent and speculation in the party over the future leadership of the party.Labour prime minister Gordon Brown found his leadership under threat in 2009 after one of his cabinet ministers dramatically quit the government and called for him to resign.Work and Pensions Secretary James Purnell - a former aide to Tony Blair - resigned from his post after the polls closed in the local and European elections, in which Labour was forecast to do badly.Explaining his decision to quit, Mr Purnell said the prime minister made a Conservative victory ""more, not less, likely"".It was Mr Brown's first direct challenge from a cabinet minister - but it would not topple the Labour leader as senior members of government refused to follow Mr Purnell's lead.Mr Brown was safe for the time being. But several months later, in January 2010, a fresh leadership challenge was mounted by two senior former Labour cabinet ministers.Geoff Hoon and Patricia Hewitt wrote to all Labour MPs, saying the party was ""deeply divided"" over Mr Brown's leadership and that the best way to resolve the issue was by way of secret ballot.They insisted it was not an ""attempted coup"" but a necessary step to resolve divisions within the party.But the duo could only muster the public support of a handful of backbenchers long-opposed to Mr Brown, with the majority of the party's MPs less than impressed by the move, which came just weeks before the general election.As the day wore on, a succession of cabinet ministers came out to back the PM, suggesting there was little momentum behind the plot - although it was noted that several were not exactly gushing in their support of Mr Brown.As history tells us, neither leadership challenge bore fruit but they reflected the internal doubts and divisions over Mr Brown at the helm.As leadership toppling attempts go, this one in 2014 was regarded as a particularly ""botched"" and ""shambolic coup"". Indeed, former Lib Dem leader Lord (Paddy) Ashdown described the move as a ""plot of deep malice"".Its instigator, Lord (Matthew) Oakeshott - a close ally of the-then Business Secretary Vince Cable - tried to unseat Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg.The peer was found to have commissioned secret polls suggesting the party would do better at the 2015 general election without Mr Clegg in the driving seat.The man Lord Oakeshott had long had in mind to take Mr Clegg's place - Mr Cable, who was on government business in China at the time - was forced to publicly condemn his friend's actions and state his backing for Mr Clegg.But Lord Oakeshott said the business secretary had in fact known about his polls and their findings.Nevertheless, the peer - who was denounced by the Lib Dem leadership for spending money that could have been spent on campaigning - quit the party, and issued a warning shot on his way out about the Lib Dems' future prospects.Mr Cable largely emerged unscathed but he faced questions about his loyalty to the leader. Although the two sought to put paid to reports of a rift with a (painfully awkward, 'nothing to see here, folks') stage-managed pint in a pub.Although the revolt failed, and Mr Clegg remained at the helm, the Lib Dems did go on to suffer a trouncing at the general election, losing nearly 50 of its MPs - one of them, Mr Cable himself - prompting his leader to quit.The Conservatives have a reputation for being more ruthless than their party rivals when it comes to getting rid of leaders they sense are no longer effectual.But, in 1995, Prime Minister John Major - tired of persistent rumours of a leadership challenge - decided to take the bull by the horns and trigger a surprise leadership election to silence his detractors.His own backbenchers had questioned Mr Major's ability to unite and lead the party, which was deeply divided over Europe.So ""put up or shut up"", he told them as he tendered his resignation as Conservative Party leader but not prime minister.But then stepped forward eurosceptic MP John Redwood, who resigned from the cabinet in order to contest Mr Major's leadership.This was unexpected by many, as the PM had said there had been assurances from his cabinet that none would stand against him.But Mr Major went on to win the ensuing election with a comfortable defeat over his challenger, who was not included in the PM's consequent cabinet reshuffle.No further contested leadership election took place until after the Conservatives' defeat at the 1997 general election, paving the way for William Hague to take over the running of the party.Not all attempts to oust a party leader end in failure: as Margaret Thatcher found out to her peril.With three electoral victories under her belt, the Conservative prime minister's downfall would come at the hands of her own party - not the voters.It was on 1 November 1990 when Geoffrey (now Lord) Howe - one of Mrs Thatcher's longest-serving ministers - resigned over differences with the party leader over Europe.In his now infamous speech on the floor of the House of Commons, he attacked the PM's policies and leadership style, comparing being one of her cabinet ministers to opening the batting at cricket only to find his bat had been ""broken... by the team captain"".It sparked the beginning of the end of the 11-year Thatcher reign.Michael (now Lord) Heseltine seized on the opportunity to challenge the prime minister in the ensuing leadership contest, from which she would eventually withdraw and John Major emerge as her successor. Reflecting on the revolt and its implications on the Conservative Party, Baroness Thatcher's biographer Charles Moore wrote: ""Because the coup was unjustified, and so trust broke down, the politics of the next 15 years were those of civil war."""
2015-05-12,Election swings and roundabouts,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-32741924,"If election manifesto claims are all about smoke and mirrors, should we now add swings and roundabouts to the political metaphor?There's an intriguing aspect to the general election results in the Midlands that puzzled me.It's the striking contrast in the swings between Labour and the Conservatives.David Cameron and his campaign strategists knew they were home and dry when Nuneaton was the first Midlands marginal to declare.It was not only a Tory hold but a swing to the Conservatives from Labour of 3%.I was in the Nottingham suburb of Beeston awaiting the result of the Broxtowe count. Would its high profile Conservative MP Anna Soubry survive a red surge?Nuneaton set the pattern. Across the Midlands, both east and west, there was a uniform swing of between three and four per cent to the Tories - Warwickshire North 3%, Amber Valley 4%, Derbyshire South 4% and Sherwood 4%. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan topped the Tory swingometer in the Midlands marginals with 5% in Loughborough.Yet in the big cities, it was a very different story. The swing went to Labour.So in Nottingham East they enjoyed a 6% swing, Nottingham South 5.8%, Leicester South 7.3%, Leicester West 5%, Birmingham Hall Green 12%, Birmingham Hodge Hill 8%.If swings to Labour on this scale had gone beyond the city ring road roundabouts and into the suburbs, Ed Miliband would have become prime minister by now.In confidence, one senior Labour insider in Nottingham told me its success in the city wards was down to organisation, experience and its teams of activists.""We won the ground war. If Nottingham's city boundaries were extended into Sherwood and Broxtowe, we would have won those constituencies as well,"" he told me.Labour leadership candidate, Leicester West's Liz Kendall has identified her party's problem beyond the ring road roundabout.It's about reaching out to Middle England.""We need to show people that we understand their aspirations and ambitions for the future,"" she told the Sunday Times.The problem for Labour was that Middle England was not interested in what the party offered…and still isn't. The Cameron brand worked its magic in those Midlands marginals... it'll take something or someone special to break up that ballot box relationship."
2015-05-12,Royal 'lobbying',https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32740154,"Prince Charles sent 27 letters to then Prime Minister Tony Blair and members of his government between September 2004 and March 2005, ""despite the Freedom of Information Act!"" as the prince joked in one.But did his suggestions and concerns have any bearing on the behaviour of Mr Blair's government?The request: Prince Charles expresses his worries over an EU directive on complementary medicines ""which is… effectively outlawing the use of certain herbal extracts"".  Mr Blair replied, offering moral support and practical help. He agreed that ""the implementation as it is currently planned is crazy"" and set out an action plan that included delaying implementation for all existing products to 2011. What happened: Herbal products were not required to be authorised until 2011, just as Mr Blair had promised. Prince Charles continues to sell his own brand of complementary products, Duchy Herbals, through Boots and Waitrose. The request: Writing to Mr Blair, the prince expresses a ""growing sense of anxiety"" that the Hill Farming Allowance, which supports farmers working on Britain's uplands, could be scrapped. In his reply, the prime minister said he understood that the Hill Farm Allowance would continue until 2007. What happened: The allowance lasted until the end of Labour's tenure in 2010, when it was abolished.The request: Just 18 months after the US-led invasion of Iraq, Prince Charles raised the issue of poor performance of Lynx helicopters in high temperatures, saying: ""I fear that this is just one more example of where our Armed Forces are being asked to do an extremely challenging job (particularly in Iraq) without the necessary resources.""Mr Blair replied: ""On the subject of the Lynx helicopter, the limitations of the existing platform, particularly in the extremely challenging environment within Iraq, are well recognised by the Ministry of Defence."" He added that replacement of the helicopters would be a priority. What happened: Mr Blair's comments go much further than what he was saying about the subject at the time. In the event, though, the fleet was not fully upgraded until 2011.The request: Prince Charles lamented that the government's TB prevention plans might not ""include a commitment to deal with the badger problem in the immediate future"" and pushed strongly for a cull, saying: ""All I can say is that I do urge you to look again at introducing a proper cull of badgers where it is necessary.""Mr Blair sympathised, saying he could ""personally see the case for culling badgers"". However, he was unwilling to commit to a cull.  What happened: Culling trials were conducted from 1998-2005. The final results, published in 2008, said that the badger cull could ""make no meaningful contribution"" to curbing bovine TB. It wasn't until 2013 that a full culling programme began in two pilot areas. These ended with the conclusion that the pilots had been neither humane nor effective at curbing the spread of TB.The request: Then Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell wrote to Prince Charles to say she had decided to give parts of the historic Smithfield meat market Grade II listed status, and was trying to persuade deputy prime minister John Prescott to ""call in"" the planning application to prevent demolition of other parts of the site. She had been swayed by evidence provided by Sir Neil Cossons, who was English Heritage chair at the time, after he had been asked by the prince to add his support. Prince Charles replied that he was ""extremely glad to read of your appreciation of the value of this group of buildings"". According to the Guardian, market workers desperate to see the redevelopment of the site invited the prince to meet them to discuss it, but his office said he was ""unlikely to accept as he did not want to interfere in the planning process"".What happened: Smithfield market is still the subject of planning battles a decade on. Successive planning applications have been refused by ministers. Last year then Communities Secretary Eric Pickles rejected plans for an office development on the site, stating that ""the extent of damage that the application would cause to the important heritage assets at Smithfield runs entirely counter to national and policy objectives intended to protect such assets from harm"".In March, the Museum of London announced a move from its current Barbican site to the Smithfield market building."
2015-05-12,Election fallout,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32703139,"""Some of those gimmicks - that tombstone, whatever idiot thought that up I do not know!""I was talking to the former Mayor of Crawley in Sussex, John Mortimer, in the town's Labour Supporters Club about the vexed question of what went wrong, and where Labour should go next. This seat is one of those southern seats Labour hoped to take, but failed.I hear a whole range of views in the club.""They didn't give nothing to depend on, they should be clear, and a little bit more down to Earth."" ""Good party, wrong leader, they don't look after business enough.""Councillor John Stanley tells me: ""I think in a way we did go too left, but now we can go a bit centre-left, or centre, depending who the new leader is.""The former mayor sums up the mood on the doorstep: ""Whatever we told them, they didn't believe us.""  Expect to hear all those views, and more, in the coming leadership contest. Step back from the angst of supporters, and it may not be that hard to see why Labour failed.  An economic recovery, hailed by independent organisations as the result of government policy, undid a party that had loudly proclaimed for five years that the coalition's policies would lead to economic disaster. Combine that with an uncharismatic and uninspirational leader, then you might argue no further debate is necessary.Fat chance of that. Defeat breeds resentment, and this one has opened up old divisions.  A chorus of Blairties, led by the man himself, has declared that Ed's problem was ignoring those with aspiration and ambition, failing to appeal to those running business. Incidentally, I've been ticked off by the perspicacious editor of the New Statesman, Jason Cowley, for using the ""unhelpful"" term ""Blairites"".I can't think of another description that fits Tony, Lord Mandelson, Lord Adonis and David Miliband quite so well. But call them what you will, the message was clear - Ed was too left wing, Labour should move back to the centre, or, if you like, to the right.Reading Mr Blair's pithy analysis, listening to Lord Mandelson's gripping and savage eloquence, describing a party sent out to shout: ""We love the poor and hate the rich,"" and so ignoring the middle, and you realise strong emotions are in play.But back to the future may not be sufficient. Of course elections are won on the centre ground. But grandees grinding axes, affronted by the failure of boys who used to make their tea, may be creating so much noise that they can't hear more insistent sounds.  For there are several elephants trumpeting loudly as they cram into the small space of the shadow cabinet room. Imagine these beasts are as gaily decorated as Berlin buddy bears. One is decked out in red, another in imperial purple bunting, and another, a mammoth, strong tusked and ice rimmed, painted yellow with tartan trimmings.Take the last first. The Scottish wipeout is Labour's biggest problem. Fail to solve it, and Labour can forget ever having a comfortable majority again. It is hard to argue Labour were wiped out in Scotland because the SNP outflanked them to the right with their appeal to the business community and the ambitious and aspirational. But it is true the SNP drew in to people from left, right and centre, just as the modernisers say Labour should. It was the politics of economic self-interest, but cast in a very different light. Tribally sneering at ""the reactionary ideology of nationalism"" as Mr Blair does, will not reach the central belt of Scotland, the middle ground of  Midlothian.What about that purple pachyderm?  In Crawley - in fact in seat after seat - there is a similar pattern.  Labour did, in fact, often increase the size of their vote. So did the Conservatives, usually by a bit more. But the real dynamic was the total collapse of the Lib Dems and the dramatic rise of UKIP. The increase in votes for Nigel Farage's party wasn't translated into parliamentary seats, but, although it is early days in terms of research, it probably hurt Labour a lot. If we believe - and I do - Matthew Goodwin and Rob Ford, authors of Revolt on the Right, these voters are often former Labour supporters - older, less educated, those left behind on the tides of  globalisation, stranded on the shores of post-industrialisation. They may have had too many disappointments to feel much ambition or aspiration. They are a challenge for Labour, and any new leader will spend a good deal of time thinking how to deal with the concerns of Europe and immigration.Whether to share their fears, or confront them will be a big decision.Which brings us to Red Nellie. Those members who still proudly call themselves socialist. This is not about Old Labour - they are more likely to be baristas or barristers than boilermakers. It is easy as an outsider, as a journalist, to treat politics as an intellectual game about how best to win power - but many people, particularly the foot soldiers, particularly after the death of  purely tribal loyalties, are in it because they passionately believe in winning  power to do something specific.Many of them are suspicious of the later incarnations of New Labour, not because it reached an accommodation with wealth and business, but because it seemed to worship at the same altar, to regard the party's core beliefs in redistribution and equality as childish fantasies from a past age.Perhaps to Mr Blair, they are the problem, people who may equate ""ambition"" with greed. They might point out that a man who claims to be worth ""only"" £20m may find it harder than most to squeeze through the eye of a needle to understand their point of view. Most successful Labour leaders will confront the left at some point, but the concerns of this group go to the existential question ""What is the party for?""This is not a polemic - not an argument about what should be done, but a reflection on the complex conundrums that will face any new Labour leader, the tearing apart of the old alliance that made up a Labour majority, and so the political need to satisfy groups with very different, indeed, contradictory demands. But looking for a Social Democratic universal theory of everything may be missing the point. What the party desperately wants is a leader who can pull the disparate threads together and articulate them as common purpose. Whether she or he exists is another matter.Much more on that in the coming months."
2015-05-12,'Take us with you',https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-32736153,"Thousands of people in the north of England have been using the hashtag ""take us with you Scotland"" to express their upset about the result of last week's general election, and Scottish nationalists are welcoming this English minority with open arms. Last Thursday's general election was a rough one for the Labour Party in its traditional stronghold in the north of England. But further to the north, the left-leaning Scottish National Party won nearly every seat it contested. That political contrast has made some left-wing voters in places like Manchester, Leeds and Sheffield look fondly on their neighbours. Since last Thursday's election in Britain the phrase ""take us with you Scotland"" has been used more than 24,000 times. ""Genuinely beginning to wonder if the North of England becoming a part of Scotland would be better for us, I really am,"" tweeted Aaron Miller from Yorkshire. Some cracked jokes under the tag after the North West Motorway Police account, which gives traffic updates, announced that they had ""picked up a pedestrian on the M62 who was trying to walk to Scotland.""After an initial spike of jokes over the weekend, the hashtag really took off when users start to mobilise in support of around a year-old petition on the campaigning site Change.org. The petition calls for the north of England to secede from the rest of the country and join up with Scotland, and more than 12,000 people have signed it.Its creator, a Sheffield resident who calls himself ""Stu Dent"", set it up to coincide with last year's Scottish independence referendum, and he also created a map imagining the boundary of a ""Scotland plus the north"" country.Stu Dent runs the Twitter account Hunters Bar, named after an area of southwest Sheffield which is very popular with - you guessed it - students. Despite the account having thousands of followers on Twitter, when the map was first posted last year, the image was shared only about 100 times - however, in the past week it's been retweeted by thousands. Stu Dent told BBC Trending that he was surprised at how popular his idea has become. ""In hindsight, perhaps I shouldn't have been,"" he said. ""There is a huge frustration in parts of the UK about the things that have happened since 2010.""""I think people need a place to go where they can say 'not in my name! This is not the England I want',"" he added. But in addition to disappointment from some quarters about the election result, there might be another reason why the petition is getting a boost now: the power of the Scottish Nationalists on Twitter. What started as a post-election joke in the North of England was quickly embraced by the so-called ""Cyber Nats"" - and a trend was born.The SNP's social media strategist Ross Colquhoun expressed the party's mood about the hashtag best, in a post which was shared more than 500 times. ""2014: #LetsStayTogether 2015: #TakeUsWithYouScotland What a difference a year makes"" he tweeted.Blog by Hannah HendersonNext story: The sport reporter and the obscene ranter who lost his jobFollow BBC Trending on Twitter @BBCtrending, and find us on Facebook."
2015-05-12,What Britain wants from Europe,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32695399,"David Cameron says he has a mandate to pursue EU reform following the Conservatives' general election victory. The PM, who will be hoping his majority government will give him extra leverage in Brussels, wants to renegotiate the terms of the UK's membership ahead of a referendum by the end of 2017. He has said he will campaign for Britain to remain in the EU if he gets the reforms he wants.Mr Cameron has said he does not want to reveal full details of his negotiating hand but he has given a broad indication, in a series of speeches and newspaper articles, of his priorities when he goes into talks with other EU leaders.These are: The prime minister has said Britain would resist any move towards a European Army and that he wants to free British police forces from EU interference. He has also ruled out Britain joining the euro.But he has placed less emphasis in recent years on demanding changes to EU social policy, such as the maximum 48-hour working week, agency workers, maternity leave and non-discrimination rules.The official UK government position is that a referendum will be held by the end of 2017 but Downing Street sources have said: ""If we can do it earlier we will.""There is speculation David Cameron is planning to hold the vote in 2016 to avoid a clash with French and German elections in 2017.The prime minister wants treaty change but even if the referendum was held in 2017 there may not be enough time to legally incorporate any reforms into a treaty and it would have to be done at a later stage.An early referendum would anger Eurosceptics who believe it would not allow enough time to make the case for exit or negotiate any meaningful concessions.""A rushed process would severely undermine the chances to secure a significant deal that both British business and voters could support and would waste the opportunity of a lifetime,"" Matthew Elliott, chief executive of Business for Britain told Breitbart London.The question is always crucial in any referendum and there is already a debate about what it should be. The Draft European Union (Referendum) Bill, published by the Conservatives in 2013, proposed this form of words: ""Do you think that the United Kingdom should remain a member of the European Union?""Some thought that leaned too far towards the status quo, encouraging a yes vote, and the Electoral Commission said it was not clear and direct enough. The watchdog proposed this form of words instead: ""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union?""The new Conservative government will attempt to repeal the Human Rights Act, which requires UK courts to treat the European Court of Human Rights as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. The European Court of Human Rights is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe (CoE), which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine.The freedom for people to move around Europe, enshrined in the EU treaties, works in parallel with the other three basic freedoms in the single market: freedom of goods, capital and services.It is likely to be a ""red line"" for other EU leaders, who do not want to see it eroded.Mr Cameron has steered clear of tackling it directly - for example by asking for an emergency ""brake"" on free movement, or a cap on numbers - focusing instead on reducing the incentive provided by welfare payments. In a speech last November, David Cameron set out measures to reduce the number of EU nationals moving to the UK.His main proposals were:Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission, has said he is ready to work with Mr Cameron to ""strike a fair deal for the United Kingdom in the EU"". The leaders of other EU nations have previously warned they are unlikely to support major changes to EU treaties to accommodate British demands. But Mr Cameron's general election victory may have given him extra leverage. ""The ball is very much in the court of the UK now,"" a senior EU official told The Guardian. ""It's up to the British to define what they want."" The key figure will be German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is very keen to keep Britain in the EU but has so far been unwilling to make major concessions to enable that to happen. There are fears that a ""pick and mix"" approach to EU treaties would undermine EU cohesion.Mr Cameron has said there is ""no doubt"" his planned reforms will require changes to the treaties governing the European Union. But this would require the unanimous support of all EU members, and may not be possible within the deadline he has set of a referendum before the end of 2017. Any attempt to change EU laws on free movement would meet fierce resistance from some EU nations, particularly Eastern European states. Mr Juncker has said free movement is non-negotiable.Mr Cameron may find it difficult to get unanimous support for his proposals for a four-year waiting period for migrant workers claiming UK benefits. East European EU members would be likely to oppose this, on the grounds that it would discriminate against their citizens.  Attempts to secure opt-outs for the City are unlikely to go down well with other European leaders.However, there are precedents for EU treaty changes to accommodate some countries' specific concerns - for example, the protocol attached to the Lisbon Treaty for Ireland.Mr Cameron has faced repeated calls to say whether he would campaign for Britain's exit from the EU in the referendum if he fails to get what he wants from the renegotiation process. All he has said is that he will ""rule nothing out"". Some Conservative MPs want Britain to leave the EU no matter what David Cameron manages to renegotiate. A larger group are likely to want more concessions than Mr Cameron has so far indicated he is prepared to demand.Senior backbencher David Davis, who was defeated by Mr Cameron for the Tory leadership in 2005, told the Daily Telegraph the majority of the 332 Conservative MPs want Mr Cameron to negotiate an ""opt-out"" power to stop individual EU laws from applying to Britain. The prime minister has said this would be ""impossible"" without Britain leaving the EU.Mr Davis claims as many as 60 Tory MPs would be prepared to rebel and vote for Britain's exit from the EU if the prime minister fails to deliver.Graham Brady, chairman of the Tory backbench 1922 committee, which represents backbenchers, has urged David Cameron to give all Conservative MPs, including ministers, a free vote in the EU referendum.In January, Mr Cameron warned that serving cabinet ministers would have to quit the government if they wanted to campaign to leave the EU if he had secured the reforms to it he wants.In the 1975 referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Economic Community, as the EU was then called, Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson decided to suspend collective responsibility because his cabinet was split on the issue. Ministers were allowed to vote with their consciences and campaign against each other. The majority of them, including Mr Wilson, joined the Yes camp, but left-wingers, such as Tony Benn, played a leading role in the No campaign. The Yes campaign won easily with 67% of the vote."

2015-05-13,Scots Labour leader Murphy to resign,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32760196,"Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy is to resign next month, he has announced.It comes despite Mr Murphy narrowly surviving a vote of no confidence at a meeting of the party's national executive in Glasgow. Mr Murphy said he would tender his resignation alongside a plan to reform the party.He lost his seat in last week's general election as the SNP won 56 of the 59 Scottish seats, leaving Labour with a single MP in Scotland.Mr Murphy said he wanted to have a successor as leader in place by the summer, and confirmed he would not be standing for a seat at the Scottish Parliament in next year's election. Instead, he said it was time to ""do something else"" and that he believed the party would continue to be divided if he remained as leader. His deputy, Kezia Dugdale MSP, will become acting leader until a permanent successor is found. Mr Murphy had faced calls to resign from several MSPs, trade unions and former MPs in the wake of his party's near wipeout at the general election.He insisted he had decided to stand down ahead of the national executive voting by 17-14 in favour of him staying in the job.Speaking at a media conference after the national executive meeting, he said: ""It is clear that a small minority who didn't accept my election as leader of the Scottish Labour Party just five months ago won't accept the vote of the executive today and that will continue to divide the party.""Today I received more support in the executive vote than I did from members of the executive when I stood for election five months ago.""He said it would be up to the executive whether to accept the reforms he would be proposing before he left the post. But he warned: ""A party in such urgent need of reform blocks those changes at its peril.""The former East Renfrewshire MP said Labour had been crushed between ""two nationalisms"" in Scotland and England.Mr Murphy said he left no legacy of bitterness for anyone in the Labour Party, and the only person he was angry at was the person who blamed Scottish Labour for the party's UK-wide general election defeat - a reference to Unite leader Len McCluskey.And he said that in many ways Scottish Labour was the ""least modernised part of the Labour movement"" and that he wanted his successor to be elected under a one member, one vote system.Mr Murphy added: ""The Labour Party's problem is not the link with trade unions, or even the relationship with Unite members - far from it. It is the destructive behaviour of one high profile trade unionist.""The leader of the Scottish Labour Party doesn't serve at the grace of Len McCluskey, and the next leader of the UK Labour Party should not be picked by Len McCluskey.""Mr McCluskey has been a vocal critic of Mr Murphy's leadership and opposed his appointment in December when Mr Murphy won the contest to replace Johann Lamont.Jim Murphy laughed and joked with Scottish Labour's sole MP as he made his way down the hotel corridor to announce his resignation.He certainly brought energy and dynamism to his election campaign - but all that achieved was Ian Murray in Edinburgh South.So as Mr Murphy bows out, who could replace him?The deputy leader Kezia Dugdale may want to step up or Neil Findlay could try again after challenging last time. Maybe the party's finance spokeswoman Jackie Baillie thinks her steady hand could steer the ship.Jenny Marra is also often talked about as future face of the party.Whoever steps into Jim Murphy's red shoes he or she will have to face a difficult 2016 Holyrood election, to put it mildly.There are also more fundamental questions about how the party can possibly move on as it faces a surging SNP.Mr Murphy was very much a creature of ""New Labour"" - but to today's generation that's old Labour.Party members may start looking for someone with no links to the past, neither a Brownite nor a Blairite. A 'cleanskin' - as the politicos put it - may well help re-connect with voters.That's a long way from now though - even some of the party's opponents may view this latest train wreck with a modicum of sympathy. Ms Lamont had resigned after claiming Scottish Labour was treated like a ""branch office"" by the London-based party leadership.Mr Murphy concluded his speech by saying: ""Scotland needs a strong Labour party; Scotland needs a united Labour party. We have been the greatest force for change in our nation's remarkable history. ""The Scottish Labour party will rise again. It will be under someone else's leadership and I am confident about my party's future.""Harriet Harman MP, acting leader of the UK Labour Party, said it would be for Scottish Labour to choose a new leader. She added: ""As a cabinet minister and leader of his party in Scotland, Jim has been a hugely important figure in the Labour Party. He leaves with the best wishes and thanks of our movement.""Labour peer Lord McConnell, a former Scottish first minister, said the party's problems were ""much deeper than one individual and one affiliate"".He said: ""We have a disconnect locally and nationally with wider Scottish society. ""We have a problem with our political positioning in the post devolution age where the party particularly at the UK level has never been comfortable with success in the Scottish parliament and has always tried to see things through a UK prism rather than a Scottish prism.""We need to find a new generation, a new leader, new generation, new ideas, a fresh approach.""In a tweet, Scottish first minister and SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said: ""I wish Jim Murphy all the very best for the future. Leadership is not easy and he deserves credit for standing up for what he believes in.""Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson also reacted on Twitter, saying: ""Jim Murphy announces a managed exit in order to help the party, which is to his credit. But leaves a tough gig for whoever comes next.""The meeting of Scottish Labour's executive was disrupted by protesters who entered the party's headquarters.Police were called and the protesters, who included persistent anti-austerity activists Sean Clerkin and Piers Doughty-Brown, left the building to protest further from the street outside.The protesters were calling for Mr Murphy to remain as leader to ""finish the job of destroying Scottish Labour"".A Police Scotland spokeswoman said officers had been called and found two protestors on the third floor of the building. She added: ""Both left on police arrival. Advice and assistance was given."""
2015-05-13,Labour contenders clash on spending,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32761561,"Prospective Labour leaders have clashed over Labour's record in government in their first public debate in the race to succeed Ed Miliband.Former cabinet ministers including Yvette Cooper and Andy Burnham defended Labour's fiscal record and spending on schools and hospitals.However, candidates from the 2010 intake of MPs argued that the party spent too much while in office.The debate followed Chuka Umunna's withdrawal from the leadership contest.The remaining candidates appeared at the annual conference of the Progress think tank in London.There was agreement that Labour needed to demonstrate economic credibility to regain power, with shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt telling the meeting that the party needed to be ""trusted with public finances and the family finances"".Mr Hunt, who was first elected to Parliament in 2010 when Labour lost power, argued the last Labour government ""spent too much"" and failed to ""leave enough economic headroom to deal with the economic crisis and the recession"".Shadow health minister Liz Kendall said: ""There's absolutely nothing progressive about spending more on debt interest payments than on educating our children.""But shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: ""The Tories have had a triumph of spin over the facts in saying what they said about the economic record of the last Labour government.""The former chief secretary to the Treasury said the deficit did ""grow too large"" in the government's later years but insisted: ""The last Labour government ran more surpluses in its first term than the Tories did in 18 years.""Yvette Cooper, another former chief secretary to the Treasury, said: ""We should never let anybody tell us that it was too many teachers, doctors or nurses that caused Lehman Brothers bank in New York to crash.""Shadow international development secretary Mary Creagh said: ""People have forgotten the economic credibility that the last Labour government had.""She said Labour had built schools and hospitals that were ""treasured in our communities"".Ms Cooper, Mr Burnham, Ms Kendall and Ms Creagh have declared their intention to run for leader, while Mr Hunt told the conference he would make an announcement next week.At the same event, shadow energy secretary Caroline Flint announced she would be running for deputy leader.The Don Valley MP told the Today programme ahead of the debate that Labour lost the election because ""fundamentally the public did not trust us on the economy"".Exeter MP Ben Bradshaw has already announced a bid to be deputy, saying Labour ""must and could win the next election"", but only if it ""broadens its appeal by adopting sensible, centre-left politics which celebrate wealth creation and entrepreneurship"".Former Labour campaign co-ordinator Tom Watson is reported to be crowd-funding a deputy leadership bid, while Walthamstow MP Stella Creasy has said she is ""open to the question"" of running.Barnsley East MP and shadow transport secretary Michael Dugher - a fierce critic of Ed Miliband's election campaign - is to run Mr Burnham's campaign, according to the website LabourList.It is reported that Mr Burnham also has the backing of Labour peer Lord Falconer, who was lord chancellor and justice secretary under Tony Blair and was close to the former PM.Shadow culture secretary Chris Bryant has signalled his backing for Ms Cooper, tweeting that the next leader must be ""someone who's been tried in the fiery furnace of public opinion"".Mr Hunt said on Friday he would be be attending the debate - along with the other four hopefuls - to ""set out my analysis on how we begin to understand what went so wrong and why"".He added: ""We must use this leadership election to ask some very profound questions.""All voices in the party must be heard so that we can have a full and proper assessment as to why the politics of nationalism triumphed in Scotland and huge swathes of England, and how we have allowed the Conservative Party to present a more compelling vision for Britain to so many millions of people.""Speculation still surrounds shadow business secretary Mr Umunna's decision to pull out on Friday, when he said he was not ""comfortable"" with the ""pressure"" of being a candidate.As well as citing extensive pressure and scrutiny Mr Umunna also said he was ruling himself out because of concerns about the impact of the bid on his family.A rising star of the party, Mr Umunna was first elected to Parliament in 2010 - alongside Tristram Hunt and Liz Kendall - before joining the shadow cabinet.Asked about the candidate who might win, Conservative Chancellor George Osborne said: ""The Labour leadership contest has descended into farce.""But it's not actually about personalities. I don't think the Labour Party any more represents the working people of this country who aspire to a better life."""

I'm not suggesting he takes a break from being leader.""Clearly the national executive has the authority, they're the ruling body. ""I'm told that they made a decision. I'm told it was a procedurally correct decision, he is the leader but I think it's important that as leader he takes a break and I think it's important that we work out how these complex questions are answered by a team.""No one person has all the answers. I'm particularly concerned about tone, making sure we get a tone that ensures that the 27 million people who didn't vote for UKIP last week may be persuaded to vote for us in future.""The party has been beset by wrangling since Mr Farage agreed to stay on as leader, days after standing down after failing to get elected in Thanet South.He had pledged before the general election that he would quit the post if he failed to get elected to Parliament.Senior aide Matthew Richardson has left the party, following claims from MEP Patrick O'Flynn that Mr Farage had fallen under the influence of ""inexperienced"" advisers.UKIP has also confirmed the departure of Mr Farage's chief of staff Raheem Kassam.Mr Farage ruled out quitting as leader on BBC's Question Time on Thursday, saying he had ""phenomenal"" support, and has challenged his critics to decide whether they want to stay in the party.In his article, Mr Carswell had said that ""knowing how difficult it is to lead a party makes me admire Nigel Farage all the more"".""I know that I never could,"" he added, stressing that he would find it ""impossible to simultaneously lead UKIP, be the voice of the party in the Commons, represent my Clacton constituents and at the same time be a husband and a dad"".However, he said that ""even leaders need to take a break"", adding: ""Nigel needs to take a break now.""UKIP got nearly four million votes at the election, but returned only one MP - former Conservative Mr Carswell in the Clacton constituency."

Under the plans, ministers could force schools rated as ""requiring improvement"" and missing new government benchmarks to become an academy.Coasting schools have average results which have often flatlined over time.Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, Mrs Morgan said faster action was needed.She said: ""Our big priorities will be to speed up the process for tackling failing schools; extend our academies programme to tackle 'coasting' schools; and deliver on our commitment to open new free schools.""The proposals will be in a new bill due to be introduced in the Queen's Speech. ""First, we will take new powers to step in from the moment that a school is found to be failing,"" Mrs Morgan said.""From day one, regional schools commissioners will be able to bring in new leadership and support from other excellent schools and heads, and we will speed up the process of turning schools into academies to make sure that new expert leadership is found for all schools that need it as quickly as possible.""She said that coasting schools will be put on an immediate notice to improve and could then be taken over and turned into an academy.They will be required to work with a team of ""expert"" head teachers.She said: ""Those that aren't able to demonstrate a clear plan for improvement will be given new leadership - we know this works in turning schools around.""More than 3,300 schools in England are labelled ""requires improvement"", but the plans are unlikely to cover that many schools.Under the current system, secondary schools are considered to be failing, and therefore eligible for intervention, if fewer than 40% of their students score at least five Cs at GCSE, including English and maths, and they do not meet national averages in pupil progress.In primary schools, the threshold for intervention is if fewer than 65% of pupils get Level 4 in reading, writing and maths and a below average number of pupils make the expected amount of progress.It is not yet clear how coasting schools will be deemed in need of intervention.It is understood that a new category will be devised covering schools which are rated as ""requires improvement"" and which fail to meet a new set of standards on improvement."
2015-05-13,Co-op Group to keep political funding,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-32762858,"The Co-operative Group has decided to continue financially supporting the Co-operative Party, which has strong ties to Labour.Members of the group, the UK's biggest mutual organisation, voted on the issue at their annual general meeting.They passed a motion by 48,579 for, to 39,479 against, to approve ""political expenditures"" of up to £1m which support the movement's objectives.Last year the Co-op Group gave £625,000 to the Co-op Party.This figure was down on the sums donated in previous years. The AGM also included a vote on new corporate governance procedures which would mean members having less of a direct say.The Co-operative Group is still recovering from a period of financial mismanagement and some members have recently expressed concerns about how elections to the board are chosen.The banking arm of the group came close to collapse in 2013, bringing the whole group to a £2.5bn annual loss that year. The Co-op Party includes among its members a number of Labour MPs, including shadow chancellor Chris Leslie and Walthamstow MP Stella Creasy. The politicians stand as candidates of both the Co-operative Party and the Labour Party, and the two political movements have strong historical ties. The board asked the members of the Co-operative Group whether they wanted to continue financially supporting the Co-operative Party, or any other party. Allan Leighton, chairman of the Co-op Group, said: ""There's a clear remit from the members to continue to support the Labour Party.""It allows us to now have a conversation with the Co-op Labour Party about what we do next.""There was also a members' motion on the agenda, put forward by those in favour of making political donations of up to £1m a year.The motion to approve political funding ""not to exceed £1m per annum"" was carried by 55.17% to 44.83%.BBC business correspondent Joe Lynam said: ""To meet a £1.5bn hole in its accounts - mostly stemming from its banking division - the Co-op Group has had to sell off parts of its businesses and hand over majority control of its bank to American hedge funds.""It's also in the process of radically changing the way it runs itself into a more corporate structure with less of a direct say by its members.""He said that ""in theory"", each of the 2.8 million Co-op members could vote on a series of motions about the reforms, as well as how its bosses are paid, and retaining the links to the Co-operative party.One of the group's largest independent societies, Midcounties, recently threatened legal action over a shortlist of six candidates for the group's board being reduced to three - the number of positions available - before a member vote.

2015-05-13,Osborne plans July 'stability' Budget,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32761566,"Chancellor George Osborne has said that he will deliver a new Budget on 8 July.He claimed it would have ""a laser-like focus"" on raising productivity and living standards.He said he was making the unusual move of having a second Budget in one year in order to ""deliver on the commitments we have made to working people"".Labour said the chancellor would have to set out ""who is going to pay"" for what it called ""uncosted promises"" in the election campaign.Speaking outside 11 Downing Street, the chancellor gave a broad outline of his plans for the forthcoming Budget but refused to be drawn on the details, including the Conservatives' planned £12bn of welfare cuts.""I don't want to wait to deliver on the commitments we have made to working people,"" he said.""It will continue with the balanced plan we have to deal with our debts, invest in our health service and reform welfare to make work pay.""But there will also be a laser-like focus on making our economy more productive so we raise living standards across our country.""We're going to put Britain into good shape for the long term.""The last Budget was held on 18 March and included tax cuts for first-time house buyers.Writing in the Sun, Mr Osborne admitted it was ""unusual"" to have two Budgets in the same year, but he wanted to turn ""promises made in the election into a reality"".Again, Mr Osborne did not specifically outline how the Conservatives plan to fulfil a pledge to cut £12bn in welfare spending but said he wants to make the welfare system ""fair for the people who pay for it"".He writes: ""We will protect the NHS and give it more funding each and every year, while making savings across Whitehall. ""We'll crack down hard on tax avoidance and aggressive tax planning by the rich - because everyone should pay their fair share.  ""We will always protect the most vulnerable, but we also need a welfare system that's fair to the people who pay for it. If you can work you should be working, so we'll take the next steps in our benefit reforms to make sure that happens.""Second, we've got to go on helping businesses create jobs in Britain, so we move towards full employment. That means facing a hard truth: in Britain we produce about a quarter less for every hour we work than countries like America or Germany. Fixing that long-running productivity weakness is the big challenge for the next five years.""So in the Budget we'll spend less on welfare, and instead invest to create three million more apprenticeships, so that young people can learn a trade, get better jobs and earn more.""After the Budget in March independent forecaster the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said that Mr Osborne needed to spell out exactly how he plans to cut £12bn from welfare spending.Of those £12bn planned cuts, £2bn were outlined ahead of the general election - all the cuts are supposed to be in place by 2017-18.Labour's shadow energy and climate change secretary, Caroline Flint, accused the Tories of making ""a number of uncosted promises"" during the election campaign.She told the BBC: ""It will be interesting to see who is going to pay for those uncosted policies when they bring the Budget in July."""
2015-05-13,Farage should take a break - Carswell,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32761766,"UKIP leader Nigel Farage ""needs to take a break now"", the party's only MP Douglas Carswell has said.Writing in the Times, Mr Carswell said he admired Mr Farage, but questioned his ""ill-advised"" comments about HIV patients, made in a TV leaders' debate.Mr Farage ruled out quitting as leader on BBC's Question Time on Thursday, saying he had ""phenomenal"" support.It follows a bitter internal row within the party, which has seen two of Mr Farage's senior aides resigning.In his article, Mr Carswell said that ""knowing how difficult it is to lead a party makes me admire Nigel Farage all the more"".""I know that I never could,"" he added, stressing that he would find it ""impossible to simultaneously lead UKIP, be the voice of the party in the Commons, represent my Clacton constituents and at the same time be a husband and a dad"".However, he said that ""even leaders need to take a break"", adding: ""Nigel needs to take a break now.""He described Mr Farage as ""inspirational"", saying the party had ""done extraordinarily well"" under his leadership but now needed to ""consider carefully what comes next"".Earlier, Mr Farage challenged his critics to decide whether they wanted him to stay in the party.He said he had ""massive"" support from UKIP MEPs, donors and party members to continue in the role, suggesting one person, whom he did not name, was ""agitating for change"".Addressing the prospect of a future EU referendum, Mr Carswell said: ""All of us UKIP supporters should ask one question; Is what I'm doing at this moment making an 'out' vote more likely? If it isn't, stop it and do something else.""He also criticised Mr Farage's comments about HIV patients during the TV leaders' debate last month.While debating about the NHS, Mr Farage said: ""You can come into Britain from anywhere in the world and get diagnosed with HIV and get the retro-viral drugs that cost up to £25,000 per year per patient.""Mr Carswell wrote: ""By all means we should highlight the problem of health tourism. But we need to admit that using the example of HIV patients to make the point was ill-advised.""He said the party needed to strike ""the right tone"" and added: ""UKIP has been at its most persuasive when we have been most optimistic.""Anger is never a great way to motivate people - at least not for very long.""The party has been beset by wrangling since Mr Farage agreed to stay on as leader, days after standing down after failing to get elected in Thanet South.He had pledged before the general election that he would quit the post if he failed to get elected to Parliament.Matthew Richardson has left the party, following claims from MEP Patrick O'Flynn that Mr Farage had fallen under the influence of ""inexperienced"" advisers. UKIP has also confirmed the departure of Mr Farage's chief of staff Raheem Kassam.UKIP got nearly four million votes at the election, but returned only one MP - former Conservative Mr Carswell in the Clacton constituency."

They absolutely loved how he helped them and he was a highly-regarded local MP,"" Mr Bone said.""He stood up for what was right rather than what the party line was. In those days - the John Major years - it was much more difficult to stand up against the party machine. He had strong views on Europe.""Sir Peter started his career as an insurance broker, joining the Wycombe Young Conservatives in 1949 and the Oxford University Conservative Association in 1951.He went on to become a Conservative councillor on Buckinghamshire County Council between 1961 and 1967.Wellingborough mayor-elect Barry Graves also paid tribute to Sir Peter, remembering him as a ""very strong constituency MP"".""I remember going out and canvassing with him and he would go everywhere. He knew the area and the people. He was very much a man of the local constituency.""He was ""a very approachable man"", Mr Graves added.Sir Peter was knighted in 1994. "

2015-05-13,PM will 'look at' powers proposals,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32746049,"David Cameron has said he would ""look at"" any proposals for further powers for Scotland but wants to get the Smith Commission plans implemented first.The prime minister was speaking after meeting Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon in Edinburgh.Mr Cameron said he made a ""commitment"" to include a devolution bill in the Queen's Speech later this month.Ms Sturgeon argued the Smith Commission proposals were ""a good starting point"" but did not go far enough.The prime minister has pledged to include a bill on devolution in this month's Queen's Speech which would be based on the cross-party Smith Commission agreement. The Smith proposals included giving Holyrood the power to set income tax rates and bands, as well as control over a share of VAT and some welfare benefits. But Ms Sturgeon's SNP also wants the Scottish Parliament to be given powers over business taxes, employment law, the minimum wage and additional powers over welfare.Speaking after meeting Ms Sturgeon, Mr Cameron told the BBC: ""Let's make sure Smith is implemented in full. I'm going to keep the commitment I made to the people of Scotland. Let's get that done first because it does create a really strong Scottish Parliament.""He added: ""Of course, if people want to make future proposals I'll look at them.""The prime minister again said he did not support full fiscal autonomy for Scotland - the responsibility for all areas of tax and spending except defence and foreign affairs - stating that it would mean £7bn of cuts or extra tax-raising.What Nicola Sturgeon is trying to say is she has a mandate. She has 56 out of the 59 MPs elected in Scotland and she won 50% of the vote - unprecedented here in Scotland.She says that gives her leverage to push David Cameron. David Cameron says he wants to keep the nation together.The language coming out of Westminster last week was very much a cordial one. 'We will listen'.Nicola Sturgeon has warned him that if he doesn't listen, then the people of Scotland will judge him accordingly.Ms  Sturgeon described the hour-long talks at her official residence at Bute House as ""constructive and business-like"". She said Mr Cameron had made a ""commitment"" that the Smith proposals would be implemented ""as agreed"".""But secondly the prime minister agreed that he would look at proposals that we would now send to suggest the areas we can go beyond Smith,"" Ms Sturgeon said.""There was no agreement in terms of the substance of that but we will submit those proposals, the prime minister has said they will consider them and there will be a meeting to look at how we take that further forward.""Referring to her party's success in last week's general election, which saw the SNP win 56 out of 59 Scottish seats, Ms Sturgeon said: ""People in Scotland have now voted fairly convincingly for the SNP and sent a message that we want the Smith Commission proposals to go further and be built on.""The ball is in his court but I'm going into this in good faith.""She added: ""David Cameron and I are a world apart politically but, where we can, I'm determined to do business in the interests of the people of Scotland and across the UK.""She said she would have a ""constructive and business-like"" relationship with the prime minister. The two leaders shook hands on the front steps of Bute House as Mr Cameron arrived. Mr Cameron left the building shortly before 11:00, almost an hour after he had arrived.The two sides agreed to hold more regular discussions in the future, possibly quarterly. "

I'm human, the rest of my life is more important to me than politics.""The shadow business secretary has been distressed by the degree of scrutiny he, his family and his girlfriend have come under since he declared his intention to stand for the labour leadership.I am told that this includes reporters waiting outside the houses of relatives late at night.Friends of Mr Umunna deny that he is nervous of not getting the support of enough MPs to run for the leadership; they point out that he already has half the necessary names and that there are some weeks to go.The shadow business secretary now wants to play a leading role in arguing that Britain should stay in the EU and does not rule out seeking the leadership in the future.He said he thought he had understood ""the scrutiny and attention a leadership contest would bring"", but added: ""However, since the night of our defeat last week I have been subject to the added level of pressure that comes with being a leadership candidate.""The shadow business secretary said he had wondered if it was too soon for him to stand for the leadership, and ""I fear it was."" He also cited concerns about the impact on ""the rest of one's life"" and those close to him.""Consequently, after further reflection, I am withdrawing my candidacy,"" he said.Mr Umunna said he would continue to serve as shadow business secretary and hoped to ""play a leading role"" in Labour's campaign to keep the UK in the EU during the forthcoming in/out referendum.Commenting on the news, Labour former culture secretary Ben Bradshaw - who is expected to run for deputy leader - said Mr Umunna was a ""terrible loss"" to the field.He told the BBC's Daily Politics the Streatham MP had been the candidate the Conservative Party ""feared the most"".""And if it's the result of pressure on an extended family or an extended group of friends, I think that's a very sad reflection on our political culture,"" he said.Chuka Umunna feels ""liberated"", he told me, by his decision to quit the Labour leadership race.He hopes to be given a good role (shadow chancellor, I wonder?) by whoever becomes Labour leader. And I expect he'll become very high profile in the campaign to keep Britain in Europe, which is increasingly looking like it will be next May.He'll endorse a candidate in the next four weeks before nominations close. It will be very interesting to see who he piles in behind.Read more from Allegra (see post 13.23).Former Labour leader Lord Kinnock said he thought Mr Umunna had made the right decision.He said: ""If he felt in his soul that he wasn't prepared to subject himself - and more importantly his family - to the kind of attention which is fairly typical, sadly, these days, he has done absolutely the right thing.""There is no point at all in inflicting avoidable, unnecessary misery on those you love most.""Leadership contender Mary Creagh said she had ""huge respect"" for Mr Umunna, telling BBC Radio 4's World at One programme it took ""courage"" to withdraw from the leadership race.Mr Umunna was ""a big beast"" and would play a ""big role"" in the future of the Labour Party, she added.Yvette Cooper, Andy Burnham, Liz Kendall and Mary Creagh have already thrown their hats into the ring for Labour's top job while a number of other potential candidates, including Dan Jarvis, Alan Johnson and David Lammy, have ruled themselves out. Candidates must secure nominations from 34 colleagues - 15% of the party's MPs - by 15 June to make it on to ballot papers, which will be sent to members in August ahead of the leader's election a month later."

However, Mr Justice Stuart Smith at Southwark Crown Court said there was a ""very strong likelihood"" a custodial sentence would follow.The jury heard how Mote submitted numerous false expenses claims for payment for work that organisations had allegedly carried out on his behalf.Mote claimed the money was to pay whistleblowers in cash through third parties. He also said he had been ""targeted for being an anti-EU MEP.""During his time an MEP he also made £250,000 legitimate expenses claims.No date has been set for the sentencing."

2015-05-13,Round-up: BBC experts' analysis,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/election-2015-32650417,"The political future of the United Kingdom has become clearer after the results of the general election emerged around the country.David Cameron says he hopes to govern for all of the UK after the Conservatives took 331 seats - enough to form a slender majority in the Commons.Labour has been all but wiped out by the SNP in Scotland and suffered a disappointing set of results elsewhere, while the Lib Dems are left with just eight MPs after many party heavyweights such as Vince Cable and Danny Alexander lost their seats.So with battles won and lost and the fall-out and celebrations beginning, BBC correspondents examine the implications and challenges that lie ahead for the new government - and for those whose political careers have been ended by voters.No pollster, no pundit, no political leader saw it coming - not even David Cameron himself.Governing parties don't gain seats. Parties that have implemented painful cuts and are promising more certainly don't. Until that is the Conservative Party did - achieving what had seemed to be Mission Impossible - a Tory majority.Until that is David Cameron's personal triumph which triggered the near simultaneous resignation of his three principle opponents - Messrs Miliband, Clegg and Farage.They did so in part because they helped to crush their partners in coalition these last five years - reducing the Liberal Democrat parliamentary party to a size when it can fit into two London taxis and still have two seats to spare.In part because the extraordinary tidal wave of support for the SNP swept dozens of once safe Labour seats away.In part because Nigel Farage persuaded millions to vote for him but secured just one seat - not, though, the one he was standing in.Read more from Nick Robinson hereThe question uppermost in the prime minister's mind as he assembles his new government is how to keep the kingdom united.""Above all I want to bring our country together,"" he revealed after the result, ""to reclaim a mantle we should never have lost - the mantle of one nation, one United Kingdom"".Looking at the political landscape from Land's End today is very different to the view from John O'Groats.A sea of Conservative and Unionist blue dominates the scene across much of England, while a field of SNP nationalist yellow stretches to the horizon and beyond from the north.David Cameron's greatest challenge is to prevent the union he supports being torn apart by mutual resentment - resentment from Scotland at a Westminster government dominated by English Tories, and resentment from England at the preferential treatment people think is being given to the Scots.Those who assumed the future of the Union had been safeguarded by the Scottish referendum must think again.Read more from Mark Easton hereOne thing is rock-solid true: the Conservatives who worked on this campaign are as surprised by the result as the pollsters, pundits, politicians and general population.Maybe they shouldn't be - the economy is in good shape and the Conservatives had incumbency advantage.But when I travelled back from the prime minister's last rally with a group of exhausted Conservative campaign officials it was clear that 290 seats was a hoped-for target.No-one talked about anything over 300 seats, and no-one even mentioned an overall majority.So what special sauce pushed David Cameron into No 10 with a Commons majority?Mr Cameron had two simple messages in the campaign and he rarely veered away from them; the first - the economy is in good shape and the recovery is threatened by Labour. And the second - the SNP would hold a Labour-led government to ransom.Read more from Jonny Dymond hereBrian Taylor, BBC political editor, ScotlandOf all the comments on the overnight apocalypse, undoubtedly the most straightforward came from a defeated Scottish Labour MP.Since there were quite a few of them, let me narrow the focus a little. Come on down, Tom Harris.Mr Harris had plainly anticipated defeat. Nonetheless, he looked suitably lugubrious as his fate was confirmed.Why, he was asked eagerly, had Labour lost? ""Because we did not win enough votes.""Psephologically, it is perfect. Complete in itself. Psychologically, it sums up Labour's gloom without descending into subsidiary matters such as leadership, strategy and the rest. As a forward-thinking strategy, it is ideal. Win more votes. Simple.Read more from Brian Taylor hereThis has been an election which may have more profound consequences than almost any in living memory.We now face a generational decision about our future in Europe, with an EU referendum in two years' time almost certain.There will also be serious questions about the future of the Union, following an SNP landslide that has turned Scotland into a virtual one-party state.David Cameron's victory also represents a colossal achievement.Only once before in recent history has an incumbent government increased its majority - and that was Mrs Thatcher in her prime in the 1980s.It is also a significant personal victory for Mr Cameron and a rebuff for those in his party who had become increasingly sceptical about his ability to win.But while it may represent a defeat for those Tories who saw this election as a potential opportunity to rid themselves of David Cameron, he must now govern with a wafer-thin majority.For the SNP, their stunning victory can only increase the pressure on Nicola Sturgeon to include a commitment to a second independence referendum in her party's manifesto for next year's Scottish elections.It is an election which has not just defied all the predictions of the pollsters and pundits - but which may yet prompt the most fundamental re-casting of British politics for a generation.Read more from Norman Smith hereAfter an extraordinary night, some brief conclusions:Read more from James Landale hereIs this the end of the union?That is the question many people will be asking this morning after the party which has fought for Scottish independence for 80 years swept to victory.The answer from the jubilant Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon is a firm ""No"".She insists that her MPs will speak for all of Scotland, not just for the 45% who voted for the country to leave the United Kingdom last September.In the closing hours of the most extraordinary election campaign which anyone in Scotland can remember, Ms Sturgeon turned to talk of ""legitimacy.""That will be her watchword in the coming days as she argues that the prime minister cannot ignore the democratic will of the Scottish people.Politically, Scotland and England this morning look and feel like very different countries.Read more from James Cook hereAfter weeks of chatter about an election too close to call, it wasn't that close at all.David Cameron will be continuing as our prime minister.So, what is all this likely to mean?A referendum on whether the UK stays in, or leaves, the European Union, within the next two-and-a-half years.A race to be the next leader of the Labour Party.A race to be the next leader of the Liberal Democrats.And a huge new presence of Scottish National Party MPs at Westminster.And so here's another thing we know for certain this morning: Politics ain't going to be boring any time soon.Read more from Chris Mason hereFor Labour the story of their terrible night is rapidly turning into the search for a new leader. So who will that be?Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, is almost certain to run.  Even before this election, both he and another almost inevitable candidate, Chuka Umunna, had raised eyebrows inside the party at the work they had put in, preparing the ground with members and the unions for potential bids.Yvette Cooper, before the election, was still thought not to have made up her mind over whether to run. That decision has been made perhaps a little easier as her husband, Ed Balls, has lost his seat.She is certainly potentially in the frame, along with two lesser known names - Liz Kendall and Dan Jarvis - two MPs who were only elected in 2010 for the first time. This could be their moment. But whoever is in the job, they face a monumental task.Read Laura Kuenssberg's Twitter hereSterling is up (the most for seven years against the euro), share prices are up (especially bank shares like Lloyds and RBS, and energy shares such as Centrica), government bond prices are up.To state the obvious, investors love the Tories' general election victory.There are a few reasons.One (no surprise here) is that Labour's threat of breaking up banks and imposing energy price caps has been lifted.Second is that investors have been discounting days and weeks of wrangling after polling day over who would form the government - and so they are semi-euphoric that we already know who's in charge.Third, many investors tend to be economically conservative and instinctively Conservative.But although the City may be a bit drunk on the result, its pleasure in Ed Miliband's and Ed Balls' humiliation may be making it a bit blind - perhaps dangerously so - to some bumps in the economic road ahead.Read more from Robert Peston hereNigel Farage dreamed of holding the balance of power, but in the end his UKIP party is now worse off than when it came into the election.At the seventh time of asking he was rejected - this time by the people of Thanet South. It was a similar story in Rochester and Strood where Mark Reckless, who sensationally defected from the Tories last year, was also sent packing.In seats on UKIP's target list, like Thurrock in Essex, the party failed to make gains. In Grimsby - where Mr Farage went twice in the last six weeks - they came third.UKIP got around four million votes - with especially strong showings in north-east and south-east England - but it's ended up with just one MP, and a vacancy at the top. This has led to UKIP attacking the current system of choosing MPs, which it's described as ""busted"" and ""dysfunctional"".In one sense, this campaign was a complete failure and it's left an aftermath of angry voters, and others wondering if the UKIP bubble has burst.Read Robin Brant's Twitter hereI monitored 91 GB-wide voting intention polls during the 2015 election campaign and found nothing in them to prepare me for the final outcome.The good news for the pollsters was that their share for the Lib Dems was pretty close, as were the shares for UKIP, the Greens and the catch-all category of Others.The bad news for the polling industry was that the crucial shares for Conservative and Labour were the ones where they came most adrift.When all the qualifications of margins of error are allowed, there did appear to be a systematic overstatement of the Labour share and an equally systematic understatement of the Conservative one.It is for the pollsters to decide whether to conduct a review of their performance but I trust they will avoid the initial knee-jerk reaction of the immediate aftermath of the 1992 polls debacle.This general election performance follows the performance of the polls in the 2014 Scottish referendum where the choice was simply binary and yet all the polls were out by between 4-6%.Something is wrong. A lot of us would like to know what it is.Read more from David Cowling hereThe words ""political earthquake"" have been translated into numerous European languages, making front page news across the continent.While Britons now examine the domestic minutiae of the election result, here in mainland Europe the vote means one thing: a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU.

""We now face a generational decision about our future in Europe, with an EU referendum in two years time almost certain. There will also be serious questions about the future of the Union, following an SNP landslide that has turned Scotland into a virtual one-party state. David Cameron's victory also represents a colossal achievement.""James Landale, deputy political editor: ""After an extraordinary night, some brief conclusions: With a small majority or slight minority for David Cameron, Tory MPs will be much empowered. As such, Mr Cameron will need support from other parties to get business through. The PM will also need a better whips office to handle rebellions.""Laura Kuenssberg, chief correspondent, Newsnight: ""For Labour the story of their terrible night is rapidly turning into the search for a new leader. So who will that be? Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, is almost certain to run.

2015-05-13,A history of political plots,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32749971,"Nigel Farage has apparently seen off a challenge to his leadership of UKIP - a move described by his former election strategist as a ""coup"". He's not the only party leader to face an attempted ousting. But can you recover from such a revolt?In 2006, the Labour prime minister was the target of what became known as the ""curry house conspiracy"" - a coup to remove him and install his chancellor, Gordon Brown, as prime minister.It would lead to several of the plotters' resignations - but not Mr Blair's. However, it was successful to a degree in that it forced the party leader into naming a departure date.The move against him was reportedly masterminded by Tom Watson, a defence minister at the time, who was also rumoured to have had a secret meeting with Mr Brown on the eve of the revolt.Apparently, Mr Watson and three fellow West Midlands MPs - Sion Simon, David Wright (both ministerial aides) and Khalid Mahmood - met over a biryani at a Wolverhampton curry house to discuss the PM's future, before dispatching a missive calling for him to quit.The letter - which attracted the support of a number of normally loyal Labour MPs - was leaked to the press, and ultimately resulted in Mr Watson's resignation.In his parting letter, the West Bromwich East MP took a shot at the prime minister, who he said should step down in the interests of party and country.Mr Blair denounced his actions and branded the former minister ""disloyal, discourteous and wrong"", saying he would have sacked him if he had not resigned.But Mr Watson's departure was swiftly followed by the resignations of six other junior members of government - who had also signed the rebel letter - in protest at the prime minister's refusal to say when he would step down as Labour leader.The whole affair resulted in Mr Blair announcing his intention to step aside within 12 months - which he duly did, on 27 June 2007.But it did nothing to quash internal dissent and speculation in the party over the future leadership of the party.Labour prime minister Gordon Brown found his leadership under threat in 2009 after one of his cabinet ministers dramatically quit the government and called for him to resign.Work and Pensions Secretary James Purnell - a former aide to Tony Blair - resigned from his post after the polls closed in the local and European elections, in which Labour was forecast to do badly.Explaining his decision to quit, Mr Purnell said the prime minister made a Conservative victory ""more, not less, likely"".It was Mr Brown's first direct challenge from a cabinet minister - but it would not topple the Labour leader as senior members of government refused to follow Mr Purnell's lead.Mr Brown was safe for the time being. But several months later, in January 2010, a fresh leadership challenge was mounted by two senior former Labour cabinet ministers.Geoff Hoon and Patricia Hewitt wrote to all Labour MPs, saying the party was ""deeply divided"" over Mr Brown's leadership and that the best way to resolve the issue was by way of secret ballot.They insisted it was not an ""attempted coup"" but a necessary step to resolve divisions within the party.But the duo could only muster the public support of a handful of backbenchers long-opposed to Mr Brown, with the majority of the party's MPs less than impressed by the move, which came just weeks before the general election.As the day wore on, a succession of cabinet ministers came out to back the PM, suggesting there was little momentum behind the plot - although it was noted that several were not exactly gushing in their support of Mr Brown.As history tells us, neither leadership challenge bore fruit but they reflected the internal doubts and divisions over Mr Brown at the helm.As leadership toppling attempts go, this one in 2014 was regarded as a particularly ""botched"" and ""shambolic coup"". Indeed, former Lib Dem leader Lord (Paddy) Ashdown described the move as a ""plot of deep malice"".Its instigator, Lord (Matthew) Oakeshott - a close ally of the-then Business Secretary Vince Cable - tried to unseat Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg.The peer was found to have commissioned secret polls suggesting the party would do better at the 2015 general election without Mr Clegg in the driving seat.The man Lord Oakeshott had long had in mind to take Mr Clegg's place - Mr Cable, who was on government business in China at the time - was forced to publicly condemn his friend's actions and state his backing for Mr Clegg.But Lord Oakeshott said the business secretary had in fact known about his polls and their findings.Nevertheless, the peer - who was denounced by the Lib Dem leadership for spending money that could have been spent on campaigning - quit the party, and issued a warning shot on his way out about the Lib Dems' future prospects.Mr Cable largely emerged unscathed but he faced questions about his loyalty to the leader. Although the two sought to put paid to reports of a rift with a (painfully awkward, 'nothing to see here, folks') stage-managed pint in a pub.Although the revolt failed, and Mr Clegg remained at the helm, the Lib Dems did go on to suffer a trouncing at the general election, losing nearly 50 of its MPs - one of them, Mr Cable himself - prompting his leader to quit.The Conservatives have a reputation for being more ruthless than their party rivals when it comes to getting rid of leaders they sense are no longer effectual.But, in 1995, Prime Minister John Major - tired of persistent rumours of a leadership challenge - decided to take the bull by the horns and trigger a surprise leadership election to silence his detractors.His own backbenchers had questioned Mr Major's ability to unite and lead the party, which was deeply divided over Europe.So ""put up or shut up"", he told them as he tendered his resignation as Conservative Party leader but not prime minister.But then stepped forward eurosceptic MP John Redwood, who resigned from the cabinet in order to contest Mr Major's leadership.This was unexpected by many, as the PM had said there had been assurances from his cabinet that none would stand against him.But Mr Major went on to win the ensuing election with a comfortable defeat over his challenger, who was not included in the PM's consequent cabinet reshuffle.No further contested leadership election took place until after the Conservatives' defeat at the 1997 general election, paving the way for William Hague to take over the running of the party.Not all attempts to oust a party leader end in failure: as Margaret Thatcher found out to her peril.With three electoral victories under her belt, the Conservative prime minister's downfall would come at the hands of her own party - not the voters.It was on 1 November 1990 when Geoffrey (now Lord) Howe - one of Mrs Thatcher's longest-serving ministers - resigned over differences with the party leader over Europe.In his now infamous speech on the floor of the House of Commons, he attacked the PM's policies and leadership style, comparing being one of her cabinet ministers to opening the batting at cricket only to find his bat had been ""broken... by the team captain"".It sparked the beginning of the end of the 11-year Thatcher reign.Michael (now Lord) Heseltine seized on the opportunity to challenge the prime minister in the ensuing leadership contest, from which she would eventually withdraw and John Major emerge as her successor. Reflecting on the revolt and its implications on the Conservative Party, Baroness Thatcher's biographer Charles Moore wrote: ""Because the coup was unjustified, and so trust broke down, the politics of the next 15 years were those of civil war."""
2015-05-13,Election swings and roundabouts,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-32741924,"If election manifesto claims are all about smoke and mirrors, should we now add swings and roundabouts to the political metaphor?There's an intriguing aspect to the general election results in the Midlands that puzzled me.It's the striking contrast in the swings between Labour and the Conservatives.David Cameron and his campaign strategists knew they were home and dry when Nuneaton was the first Midlands marginal to declare.It was not only a Tory hold but a swing to the Conservatives from Labour of 3%.I was in the Nottingham suburb of Beeston awaiting the result of the Broxtowe count. Would its high profile Conservative MP Anna Soubry survive a red surge?Nuneaton set the pattern. Across the Midlands, both east and west, there was a uniform swing of between three and four per cent to the Tories - Warwickshire North 3%, Amber Valley 4%, Derbyshire South 4% and Sherwood 4%. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan topped the Tory swingometer in the Midlands marginals with 5% in Loughborough.Yet in the big cities, it was a very different story. The swing went to Labour.So in Nottingham East they enjoyed a 6% swing, Nottingham South 5.8%, Leicester South 7.3%, Leicester West 5%, Birmingham Hall Green 12%, Birmingham Hodge Hill 8%.If swings to Labour on this scale had gone beyond the city ring road roundabouts and into the suburbs, Ed Miliband would have become prime minister by now.In confidence, one senior Labour insider in Nottingham told me its success in the city wards was down to organisation, experience and its teams of activists.""We won the ground war. If Nottingham's city boundaries were extended into Sherwood and Broxtowe, we would have won those constituencies as well,"" he told me.Labour leadership candidate, Leicester West's Liz Kendall has identified her party's problem beyond the ring road roundabout.It's about reaching out to Middle England.""We need to show people that we understand their aspirations and ambitions for the future,"" she told the Sunday Times.The problem for Labour was that Middle England was not interested in what the party offered…and still isn't. The Cameron brand worked its magic in those Midlands marginals... it'll take something or someone special to break up that ballot box relationship."
2015-05-13,Royal 'lobbying',https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32740154,"Prince Charles sent 27 letters to then Prime Minister Tony Blair and members of his government between September 2004 and March 2005, ""despite the Freedom of Information Act!"" as the prince joked in one.But did his suggestions and concerns have any bearing on the behaviour of Mr Blair's government?The request: Prince Charles expresses his worries over an EU directive on complementary medicines ""which is… effectively outlawing the use of certain herbal extracts"".  Mr Blair replied, offering moral support and practical help. He agreed that ""the implementation as it is currently planned is crazy"" and set out an action plan that included delaying implementation for all existing products to 2011. What happened: Herbal products were not required to be authorised until 2011, just as Mr Blair had promised. Prince Charles continues to sell his own brand of complementary products, Duchy Herbals, through Boots and Waitrose. The request: Writing to Mr Blair, the prince expresses a ""growing sense of anxiety"" that the Hill Farming Allowance, which supports farmers working on Britain's uplands, could be scrapped. In his reply, the prime minister said he understood that the Hill Farm Allowance would continue until 2007. What happened: The allowance lasted until the end of Labour's tenure in 2010, when it was abolished.The request: Just 18 months after the US-led invasion of Iraq, Prince Charles raised the issue of poor performance of Lynx helicopters in high temperatures, saying: ""I fear that this is just one more example of where our Armed Forces are being asked to do an extremely challenging job (particularly in Iraq) without the necessary resources.""Mr Blair replied: ""On the subject of the Lynx helicopter, the limitations of the existing platform, particularly in the extremely challenging environment within Iraq, are well recognised by the Ministry of Defence."" He added that replacement of the helicopters would be a priority. What happened: Mr Blair's comments go much further than what he was saying about the subject at the time. In the event, though, the fleet was not fully upgraded until 2011.The request: Prince Charles lamented that the government's TB prevention plans might not ""include a commitment to deal with the badger problem in the immediate future"" and pushed strongly for a cull, saying: ""All I can say is that I do urge you to look again at introducing a proper cull of badgers where it is necessary.""Mr Blair sympathised, saying he could ""personally see the case for culling badgers"". However, he was unwilling to commit to a cull.  What happened: Culling trials were conducted from 1998-2005. The final results, published in 2008, said that the badger cull could ""make no meaningful contribution"" to curbing bovine TB. It wasn't until 2013 that a full culling programme began in two pilot areas. These ended with the conclusion that the pilots had been neither humane nor effective at curbing the spread of TB.The request: Then Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell wrote to Prince Charles to say she had decided to give parts of the historic Smithfield meat market Grade II listed status, and was trying to persuade deputy prime minister John Prescott to ""call in"" the planning application to prevent demolition of other parts of the site. She had been swayed by evidence provided by Sir Neil Cossons, who was English Heritage chair at the time, after he had been asked by the prince to add his support. Prince Charles replied that he was ""extremely glad to read of your appreciation of the value of this group of buildings"". According to the Guardian, market workers desperate to see the redevelopment of the site invited the prince to meet them to discuss it, but his office said he was ""unlikely to accept as he did not want to interfere in the planning process"".What happened: Smithfield market is still the subject of planning battles a decade on. Successive planning applications have been refused by ministers. Last year then Communities Secretary Eric Pickles rejected plans for an office development on the site, stating that ""the extent of damage that the application would cause to the important heritage assets at Smithfield runs entirely counter to national and policy objectives intended to protect such assets from harm"".In March, the Museum of London announced a move from its current Barbican site to the Smithfield market building."
2015-05-13,Election fallout,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32703139,"""Some of those gimmicks - that tombstone, whatever idiot thought that up I do not know!""I was talking to the former Mayor of Crawley in Sussex, John Mortimer, in the town's Labour Supporters Club about the vexed question of what went wrong, and where Labour should go next. This seat is one of those southern seats Labour hoped to take, but failed.I hear a whole range of views in the club.""They didn't give nothing to depend on, they should be clear, and a little bit more down to Earth."" ""Good party, wrong leader, they don't look after business enough.""Councillor John Stanley tells me: ""I think in a way we did go too left, but now we can go a bit centre-left, or centre, depending who the new leader is.""The former mayor sums up the mood on the doorstep: ""Whatever we told them, they didn't believe us.""  Expect to hear all those views, and more, in the coming leadership contest. Step back from the angst of supporters, and it may not be that hard to see why Labour failed.  An economic recovery, hailed by independent organisations as the result of government policy, undid a party that had loudly proclaimed for five years that the coalition's policies would lead to economic disaster. Combine that with an uncharismatic and uninspirational leader, then you might argue no further debate is necessary.Fat chance of that. Defeat breeds resentment, and this one has opened up old divisions.  A chorus of Blairties, led by the man himself, has declared that Ed's problem was ignoring those with aspiration and ambition, failing to appeal to those running business. Incidentally, I've been ticked off by the perspicacious editor of the New Statesman, Jason Cowley, for using the ""unhelpful"" term ""Blairites"".I can't think of another description that fits Tony, Lord Mandelson, Lord Adonis and David Miliband quite so well. But call them what you will, the message was clear - Ed was too left wing, Labour should move back to the centre, or, if you like, to the right.Reading Mr Blair's pithy analysis, listening to Lord Mandelson's gripping and savage eloquence, describing a party sent out to shout: ""We love the poor and hate the rich,"" and so ignoring the middle, and you realise strong emotions are in play.But back to the future may not be sufficient. Of course elections are won on the centre ground. But grandees grinding axes, affronted by the failure of boys who used to make their tea, may be creating so much noise that they can't hear more insistent sounds.  For there are several elephants trumpeting loudly as they cram into the small space of the shadow cabinet room. Imagine these beasts are as gaily decorated as Berlin buddy bears. One is decked out in red, another in imperial purple bunting, and another, a mammoth, strong tusked and ice rimmed, painted yellow with tartan trimmings.Take the last first. The Scottish wipeout is Labour's biggest problem. Fail to solve it, and Labour can forget ever having a comfortable majority again. It is hard to argue Labour were wiped out in Scotland because the SNP outflanked them to the right with their appeal to the business community and the ambitious and aspirational. But it is true the SNP drew in to people from left, right and centre, just as the modernisers say Labour should. It was the politics of economic self-interest, but cast in a very different light. Tribally sneering at ""the reactionary ideology of nationalism"" as Mr Blair does, will not reach the central belt of Scotland, the middle ground of  Midlothian.What about that purple pachyderm?  In Crawley - in fact in seat after seat - there is a similar pattern.  Labour did, in fact, often increase the size of their vote. So did the Conservatives, usually by a bit more. But the real dynamic was the total collapse of the Lib Dems and the dramatic rise of UKIP. The increase in votes for Nigel Farage's party wasn't translated into parliamentary seats, but, although it is early days in terms of research, it probably hurt Labour a lot. If we believe - and I do - Matthew Goodwin and Rob Ford, authors of Revolt on the Right, these voters are often former Labour supporters - older, less educated, those left behind on the tides of  globalisation, stranded on the shores of post-industrialisation. They may have had too many disappointments to feel much ambition or aspiration. They are a challenge for Labour, and any new leader will spend a good deal of time thinking how to deal with the concerns of Europe and immigration.Whether to share their fears, or confront them will be a big decision.Which brings us to Red Nellie. Those members who still proudly call themselves socialist. This is not about Old Labour - they are more likely to be baristas or barristers than boilermakers. It is easy as an outsider, as a journalist, to treat politics as an intellectual game about how best to win power - but many people, particularly the foot soldiers, particularly after the death of  purely tribal loyalties, are in it because they passionately believe in winning  power to do something specific.Many of them are suspicious of the later incarnations of New Labour, not because it reached an accommodation with wealth and business, but because it seemed to worship at the same altar, to regard the party's core beliefs in redistribution and equality as childish fantasies from a past age.Perhaps to Mr Blair, they are the problem, people who may equate ""ambition"" with greed. They might point out that a man who claims to be worth ""only"" £20m may find it harder than most to squeeze through the eye of a needle to understand their point of view. Most successful Labour leaders will confront the left at some point, but the concerns of this group go to the existential question ""What is the party for?""This is not a polemic - not an argument about what should be done, but a reflection on the complex conundrums that will face any new Labour leader, the tearing apart of the old alliance that made up a Labour majority, and so the political need to satisfy groups with very different, indeed, contradictory demands. But looking for a Social Democratic universal theory of everything may be missing the point. What the party desperately wants is a leader who can pull the disparate threads together and articulate them as common purpose. Whether she or he exists is another matter.Much more on that in the coming months."
2015-05-13,'Take us with you',https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-32736153,"Thousands of people in the north of England have been using the hashtag ""take us with you Scotland"" to express their upset about the result of last week's general election, and Scottish nationalists are welcoming this English minority with open arms. Last Thursday's general election was a rough one for the Labour Party in its traditional stronghold in the north of England. But further to the north, the left-leaning Scottish National Party won nearly every seat it contested. That political contrast has made some left-wing voters in places like Manchester, Leeds and Sheffield look fondly on their neighbours. Since last Thursday's election in Britain the phrase ""take us with you Scotland"" has been used more than 24,000 times. ""Genuinely beginning to wonder if the North of England becoming a part of Scotland would be better for us, I really am,"" tweeted Aaron Miller from Yorkshire. Some cracked jokes under the tag after the North West Motorway Police account, which gives traffic updates, announced that they had ""picked up a pedestrian on the M62 who was trying to walk to Scotland.""After an initial spike of jokes over the weekend, the hashtag really took off when users start to mobilise in support of around a year-old petition on the campaigning site Change.org. The petition calls for the north of England to secede from the rest of the country and join up with Scotland, and more than 12,000 people have signed it.Its creator, a Sheffield resident who calls himself ""Stu Dent"", set it up to coincide with last year's Scottish independence referendum, and he also created a map imagining the boundary of a ""Scotland plus the north"" country.Stu Dent runs the Twitter account Hunters Bar, named after an area of southwest Sheffield which is very popular with - you guessed it - students. Despite the account having thousands of followers on Twitter, when the map was first posted last year, the image was shared only about 100 times - however, in the past week it's been retweeted by thousands. Stu Dent told BBC Trending that he was surprised at how popular his idea has become. ""In hindsight, perhaps I shouldn't have been,"" he said. ""There is a huge frustration in parts of the UK about the things that have happened since 2010.""""I think people need a place to go where they can say 'not in my name!

2015-05-13,What Britain wants from Europe,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32695399,"David Cameron says he has a mandate to pursue EU reform following the Conservatives' general election victory. The PM, who will be hoping his majority government will give him extra leverage in Brussels, wants to renegotiate the terms of the UK's membership ahead of a referendum by the end of 2017. He has said he will campaign for Britain to remain in the EU if he gets the reforms he wants.Mr Cameron has said he does not want to reveal full details of his negotiating hand but he has given a broad indication, in a series of speeches and newspaper articles, of his priorities when he goes into talks with other EU leaders.These are: The prime minister has said Britain would resist any move towards a European Army and that he wants to free British police forces from EU interference. He has also ruled out Britain joining the euro.But he has placed less emphasis in recent years on demanding changes to EU social policy, such as the maximum 48-hour working week, agency workers, maternity leave and non-discrimination rules.The official UK government position is that a referendum will be held by the end of 2017 but Downing Street sources have said: ""If we can do it earlier we will.""There is speculation David Cameron is planning to hold the vote in 2016 to avoid a clash with French and German elections in 2017.The prime minister wants treaty change but even if the referendum was held in 2017 there may not be enough time to legally incorporate any reforms into a treaty and it would have to be done at a later stage.An early referendum would anger Eurosceptics who believe it would not allow enough time to make the case for exit or negotiate any meaningful concessions.""A rushed process would severely undermine the chances to secure a significant deal that both British business and voters could support and would waste the opportunity of a lifetime,"" Matthew Elliott, chief executive of Business for Britain told Breitbart London.The question is always crucial in any referendum and there is already a debate about what it should be. The Draft European Union (Referendum) Bill, published by the Conservatives in 2013, proposed this form of words: ""Do you think that the United Kingdom should remain a member of the European Union?""Some thought that leaned too far towards the status quo, encouraging a yes vote, and the Electoral Commission said it was not clear and direct enough. The watchdog proposed this form of words instead: ""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union?""The new Conservative government will attempt to repeal the Human Rights Act, which requires UK courts to treat the European Court of Human Rights as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. The European Court of Human Rights is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe (CoE), which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine.The freedom for people to move around Europe, enshrined in the EU treaties, works in parallel with the other three basic freedoms in the single market: freedom of goods, capital and services.It is likely to be a ""red line"" for other EU leaders, who do not want to see it eroded.Mr Cameron has steered clear of tackling it directly - for example by asking for an emergency ""brake"" on free movement, or a cap on numbers - focusing instead on reducing the incentive provided by welfare payments. In a speech last November, David Cameron set out measures to reduce the number of EU nationals moving to the UK.His main proposals were:Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission, has said he is ready to work with Mr Cameron to ""strike a fair deal for the United Kingdom in the EU"". The leaders of other EU nations have previously warned they are unlikely to support major changes to EU treaties to accommodate British demands. But Mr Cameron's general election victory may have given him extra leverage. ""The ball is very much in the court of the UK now,"" a senior EU official told The Guardian. ""It's up to the British to define what they want."" The key figure will be German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is very keen to keep Britain in the EU but has so far been unwilling to make major concessions to enable that to happen. There are fears that a ""pick and mix"" approach to EU treaties would undermine EU cohesion.Mr Cameron has said there is ""no doubt"" his planned reforms will require changes to the treaties governing the European Union. But this would require the unanimous support of all EU members, and may not be possible within the deadline he has set of a referendum before the end of 2017. Any attempt to change EU laws on free movement would meet fierce resistance from some EU nations, particularly Eastern European states. Mr Juncker has said free movement is non-negotiable.Mr Cameron may find it difficult to get unanimous support for his proposals for a four-year waiting period for migrant workers claiming UK benefits. East European EU members would be likely to oppose this, on the grounds that it would discriminate against their citizens.  Attempts to secure opt-outs for the City are unlikely to go down well with other European leaders.However, there are precedents for EU treaty changes to accommodate some countries' specific concerns - for example, the protocol attached to the Lisbon Treaty for Ireland.Mr Cameron has faced repeated calls to say whether he would campaign for Britain's exit from the EU in the referendum if he fails to get what he wants from the renegotiation process. All he has said is that he will ""rule nothing out"". Some Conservative MPs want Britain to leave the EU no matter what David Cameron manages to renegotiate. A larger group are likely to want more concessions than Mr Cameron has so far indicated he is prepared to demand.Senior backbencher David Davis, who was defeated by Mr Cameron for the Tory leadership in 2005, told the Daily Telegraph the majority of the 332 Conservative MPs want Mr Cameron to negotiate an ""opt-out"" power to stop individual EU laws from applying to Britain. The prime minister has said this would be ""impossible"" without Britain leaving the EU.Mr Davis claims as many as 60 Tory MPs would be prepared to rebel and vote for Britain's exit from the EU if the prime minister fails to deliver.Graham Brady, chairman of the Tory backbench 1922 committee, which represents backbenchers, has urged David Cameron to give all Conservative MPs, including ministers, a free vote in the EU referendum.In January, Mr Cameron warned that serving cabinet ministers would have to quit the government if they wanted to campaign to leave the EU if he had secured the reforms to it he wants.In the 1975 referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Economic Community, as the EU was then called, Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson decided to suspend collective responsibility because his cabinet was split on the issue. Ministers were allowed to vote with their consciences and campaign against each other. The majority of them, including Mr Wilson, joined the Yes camp, but left-wingers, such as Tony Benn, played a leading role in the No campaign. The Yes campaign won easily with 67% of the vote."

2015-05-14,Scots Labour leader Murphy to resign,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32760196,"Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy is to resign next month, he has announced.It comes despite Mr Murphy narrowly surviving a vote of no confidence at a meeting of the party's national executive in Glasgow. Mr Murphy said he would tender his resignation alongside a plan to reform the party.He lost his seat in last week's general election as the SNP won 56 of the 59 Scottish seats, leaving Labour with a single MP in Scotland.Mr Murphy said he wanted to have a successor as leader in place by the summer, and confirmed he would not be standing for a seat at the Scottish Parliament in next year's election. Instead, he said it was time to ""do something else"" and that he believed the party would continue to be divided if he remained as leader. His deputy, Kezia Dugdale MSP, will become acting leader until a permanent successor is found. Mr Murphy had faced calls to resign from several MSPs, trade unions and former MPs in the wake of his party's near wipeout at the general election.He insisted he had decided to stand down ahead of the national executive voting by 17-14 in favour of him staying in the job.Speaking at a media conference after the national executive meeting, he said: ""It is clear that a small minority who didn't accept my election as leader of the Scottish Labour Party just five months ago won't accept the vote of the executive today and that will continue to divide the party.""Today I received more support in the executive vote than I did from members of the executive when I stood for election five months ago.""He said it would be up to the executive whether to accept the reforms he would be proposing before he left the post. But he warned: ""A party in such urgent need of reform blocks those changes at its peril.""The former East Renfrewshire MP said Labour had been crushed between ""two nationalisms"" in Scotland and England.Mr Murphy said he left no legacy of bitterness for anyone in the Labour Party, and the only person he was angry at was the person who blamed Scottish Labour for the party's UK-wide general election defeat - a reference to Unite leader Len McCluskey.And he said that in many ways Scottish Labour was the ""least modernised part of the Labour movement"" and that he wanted his successor to be elected under a one member, one vote system.Mr Murphy added: ""The Labour Party's problem is not the link with trade unions, or even the relationship with Unite members - far from it. It is the destructive behaviour of one high profile trade unionist.""The leader of the Scottish Labour Party doesn't serve at the grace of Len McCluskey, and the next leader of the UK Labour Party should not be picked by Len McCluskey.""Mr McCluskey has been a vocal critic of Mr Murphy's leadership and opposed his appointment in December when Mr Murphy won the contest to replace Johann Lamont.Jim Murphy laughed and joked with Scottish Labour's sole MP as he made his way down the hotel corridor to announce his resignation.He certainly brought energy and dynamism to his election campaign - but all that achieved was Ian Murray in Edinburgh South.So as Mr Murphy bows out, who could replace him?The deputy leader Kezia Dugdale may want to step up or Neil Findlay could try again after challenging last time. Maybe the party's finance spokeswoman Jackie Baillie thinks her steady hand could steer the ship.Jenny Marra is also often talked about as future face of the party.Whoever steps into Jim Murphy's red shoes he or she will have to face a difficult 2016 Holyrood election, to put it mildly.There are also more fundamental questions about how the party can possibly move on as it faces a surging SNP.Mr Murphy was very much a creature of ""New Labour"" - but to today's generation that's old Labour.Party members may start looking for someone with no links to the past, neither a Brownite nor a Blairite. A 'cleanskin' - as the politicos put it - may well help re-connect with voters.That's a long way from now though - even some of the party's opponents may view this latest train wreck with a modicum of sympathy. Ms Lamont had resigned after claiming Scottish Labour was treated like a ""branch office"" by the London-based party leadership.Mr Murphy concluded his speech by saying: ""Scotland needs a strong Labour party; Scotland needs a united Labour party. We have been the greatest force for change in our nation's remarkable history. ""The Scottish Labour party will rise again. It will be under someone else's leadership and I am confident about my party's future.""Harriet Harman MP, acting leader of the UK Labour Party, said it would be for Scottish Labour to choose a new leader. She added: ""As a cabinet minister and leader of his party in Scotland, Jim has been a hugely important figure in the Labour Party. He leaves with the best wishes and thanks of our movement.""Labour peer Lord McConnell, a former Scottish first minister, said the party's problems were ""much deeper than one individual and one affiliate"".He said: ""We have a disconnect locally and nationally with wider Scottish society. ""We have a problem with our political positioning in the post devolution age where the party particularly at the UK level has never been comfortable with success in the Scottish parliament and has always tried to see things through a UK prism rather than a Scottish prism.""We need to find a new generation, a new leader, new generation, new ideas, a fresh approach.""In a tweet, Scottish first minister and SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said: ""I wish Jim Murphy all the very best for the future. Leadership is not easy and he deserves credit for standing up for what he believes in.""Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson also reacted on Twitter, saying: ""Jim Murphy announces a managed exit in order to help the party, which is to his credit. But leaves a tough gig for whoever comes next.""The meeting of Scottish Labour's executive was disrupted by protesters who entered the party's headquarters.Police were called and the protesters, who included persistent anti-austerity activists Sean Clerkin and Piers Doughty-Brown, left the building to protest further from the street outside.The protesters were calling for Mr Murphy to remain as leader to ""finish the job of destroying Scottish Labour"".A Police Scotland spokeswoman said officers had been called and found two protestors on the third floor of the building. She added: ""Both left on police arrival. Advice and assistance was given."""
2015-05-14,Labour contenders clash on spending,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32761561,"Prospective Labour leaders have clashed over Labour's record in government in their first public debate in the race to succeed Ed Miliband.Former cabinet ministers including Yvette Cooper and Andy Burnham defended Labour's fiscal record and spending on schools and hospitals.However, candidates from the 2010 intake of MPs argued that the party spent too much while in office.The debate followed Chuka Umunna's withdrawal from the leadership contest.The remaining candidates appeared at the annual conference of the Progress think tank in London.There was agreement that Labour needed to demonstrate economic credibility to regain power, with shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt telling the meeting that the party needed to be ""trusted with public finances and the family finances"".Mr Hunt, who was first elected to Parliament in 2010 when Labour lost power, argued the last Labour government ""spent too much"" and failed to ""leave enough economic headroom to deal with the economic crisis and the recession"".Shadow health minister Liz Kendall said: ""There's absolutely nothing progressive about spending more on debt interest payments than on educating our children.""But shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: ""The Tories have had a triumph of spin over the facts in saying what they said about the economic record of the last Labour government.""The former chief secretary to the Treasury said the deficit did ""grow too large"" in the government's later years but insisted: ""The last Labour government ran more surpluses in its first term than the Tories did in 18 years.""Yvette Cooper, another former chief secretary to the Treasury, said: ""We should never let anybody tell us that it was too many teachers, doctors or nurses that caused Lehman Brothers bank in New York to crash.""Shadow international development secretary Mary Creagh said: ""People have forgotten the economic credibility that the last Labour government had.""She said Labour had built schools and hospitals that were ""treasured in our communities"".Ms Cooper, Mr Burnham, Ms Kendall and Ms Creagh have declared their intention to run for leader, while Mr Hunt told the conference he would make an announcement next week.At the same event, shadow energy secretary Caroline Flint announced she would be running for deputy leader.The Don Valley MP told the Today programme ahead of the debate that Labour lost the election because ""fundamentally the public did not trust us on the economy"".Exeter MP Ben Bradshaw has already announced a bid to be deputy, saying Labour ""must and could win the next election"", but only if it ""broadens its appeal by adopting sensible, centre-left politics which celebrate wealth creation and entrepreneurship"".Former Labour campaign co-ordinator Tom Watson is reported to be crowd-funding a deputy leadership bid, while Walthamstow MP Stella Creasy has said she is ""open to the question"" of running.Barnsley East MP and shadow transport secretary Michael Dugher - a fierce critic of Ed Miliband's election campaign - is to run Mr Burnham's campaign, according to the website LabourList.It is reported that Mr Burnham also has the backing of Labour peer Lord Falconer, who was lord chancellor and justice secretary under Tony Blair and was close to the former PM.Shadow culture secretary Chris Bryant has signalled his backing for Ms Cooper, tweeting that the next leader must be ""someone who's been tried in the fiery furnace of public opinion"".Mr Hunt said on Friday he would be be attending the debate - along with the other four hopefuls - to ""set out my analysis on how we begin to understand what went so wrong and why"".He added: ""We must use this leadership election to ask some very profound questions.""All voices in the party must be heard so that we can have a full and proper assessment as to why the politics of nationalism triumphed in Scotland and huge swathes of England, and how we have allowed the Conservative Party to present a more compelling vision for Britain to so many millions of people.""Speculation still surrounds shadow business secretary Mr Umunna's decision to pull out on Friday, when he said he was not ""comfortable"" with the ""pressure"" of being a candidate.As well as citing extensive pressure and scrutiny Mr Umunna also said he was ruling himself out because of concerns about the impact of the bid on his family.A rising star of the party, Mr Umunna was first elected to Parliament in 2010 - alongside Tristram Hunt and Liz Kendall - before joining the shadow cabinet.Asked about the candidate who might win, Conservative Chancellor George Osborne said: ""The Labour leadership contest has descended into farce.""But it's not actually about personalities. I don't think the Labour Party any more represents the working people of this country who aspire to a better life."""

I'm not suggesting he takes a break from being leader.""Clearly the national executive has the authority, they're the ruling body. ""I'm told that they made a decision. I'm told it was a procedurally correct decision, he is the leader but I think it's important that as leader he takes a break and I think it's important that we work out how these complex questions are answered by a team.""No one person has all the answers. I'm particularly concerned about tone, making sure we get a tone that ensures that the 27 million people who didn't vote for UKIP last week may be persuaded to vote for us in future.""The party has been beset by wrangling since Mr Farage agreed to stay on as leader, days after standing down after failing to get elected in Thanet South.He had pledged before the general election that he would quit the post if he failed to get elected to Parliament.Senior aide Matthew Richardson has left the party, following claims from MEP Patrick O'Flynn that Mr Farage had fallen under the influence of ""inexperienced"" advisers.UKIP has also confirmed the departure of Mr Farage's chief of staff Raheem Kassam.Mr Farage ruled out quitting as leader on BBC's Question Time on Thursday, saying he had ""phenomenal"" support, and has challenged his critics to decide whether they want to stay in the party.In his article, Mr Carswell had said that ""knowing how difficult it is to lead a party makes me admire Nigel Farage all the more"".""I know that I never could,"" he added, stressing that he would find it ""impossible to simultaneously lead UKIP, be the voice of the party in the Commons, represent my Clacton constituents and at the same time be a husband and a dad"".However, he said that ""even leaders need to take a break"", adding: ""Nigel needs to take a break now.""UKIP got nearly four million votes at the election, but returned only one MP - former Conservative Mr Carswell in the Clacton constituency."
2015-05-14,Coasting schools 'must improve',https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/education-32763097,"Education Secretary Nicky Morgan has said new powers to sack head teachers in coasting schools will show ""it is not OK to be just above the level of failing"". Under the plans, ministers could force schools rated as ""requiring improvement"" and missing new government benchmarks to become an academy.Coasting schools have average results which have often flatlined over time.Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, Mrs Morgan said faster action was needed.She said: ""Our big priorities will be to speed up the process for tackling failing schools; extend our academies programme to tackle 'coasting' schools; and deliver on our commitment to open new free schools.""The proposals will be in a new bill due to be introduced in the Queen's Speech. ""First, we will take new powers to step in from the moment that a school is found to be failing,"" Mrs Morgan said.""From day one, regional schools commissioners will be able to bring in new leadership and support from other excellent schools and heads, and we will speed up the process of turning schools into academies to make sure that new expert leadership is found for all schools that need it as quickly as possible.""She said that coasting schools will be put on an immediate notice to improve and could then be taken over and turned into an academy.They will be required to work with a team of ""expert"" head teachers.She said: ""Those that aren't able to demonstrate a clear plan for improvement will be given new leadership - we know this works in turning schools around.""More than 3,300 schools in England are labelled ""requires improvement"", but the plans are unlikely to cover that many schools.Under the current system, secondary schools are considered to be failing, and therefore eligible for intervention, if fewer than 40% of their students score at least five Cs at GCSE, including English and maths, and they do not meet national averages in pupil progress.In primary schools, the threshold for intervention is if fewer than 65% of pupils get Level 4 in reading, writing and maths and a below average number of pupils make the expected amount of progress.It is not yet clear how coasting schools will be deemed in need of intervention.It is understood that a new category will be devised covering schools which are rated as ""requires improvement"" and which fail to meet a new set of standards on improvement."
2015-05-14,Co-op Group to keep political funding,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-32762858,"The Co-operative Group has decided to continue financially supporting the Co-operative Party, which has strong ties to Labour.Members of the group, the UK's biggest mutual organisation, voted on the issue at their annual general meeting.They passed a motion by 48,579 for, to 39,479 against, to approve ""political expenditures"" of up to £1m which support the movement's objectives.Last year the Co-op Group gave £625,000 to the Co-op Party.This figure was down on the sums donated in previous years. The AGM also included a vote on new corporate governance procedures which would mean members having less of a direct say.The Co-operative Group is still recovering from a period of financial mismanagement and some members have recently expressed concerns about how elections to the board are chosen.The banking arm of the group came close to collapse in 2013, bringing the whole group to a £2.5bn annual loss that year. The Co-op Party includes among its members a number of Labour MPs, including shadow chancellor Chris Leslie and Walthamstow MP Stella Creasy. The politicians stand as candidates of both the Co-operative Party and the Labour Party, and the two political movements have strong historical ties. The board asked the members of the Co-operative Group whether they wanted to continue financially supporting the Co-operative Party, or any other party. Allan Leighton, chairman of the Co-op Group, said: ""There's a clear remit from the members to continue to support the Labour Party.""It allows us to now have a conversation with the Co-op Labour Party about what we do next.""There was also a members' motion on the agenda, put forward by those in favour of making political donations of up to £1m a year.The motion to approve political funding ""not to exceed £1m per annum"" was carried by 55.17% to 44.83%.BBC business correspondent Joe Lynam said: ""To meet a £1.5bn hole in its accounts - mostly stemming from its banking division - the Co-op Group has had to sell off parts of its businesses and hand over majority control of its bank to American hedge funds.""It's also in the process of radically changing the way it runs itself into a more corporate structure with less of a direct say by its members.""He said that ""in theory"", each of the 2.8 million Co-op members could vote on a series of motions about the reforms, as well as how its bosses are paid, and retaining the links to the Co-operative party.One of the group's largest independent societies, Midcounties, recently threatened legal action over a shortlist of six candidates for the group's board being reduced to three - the number of positions available - before a member vote.

2015-05-14,Osborne plans July 'stability' Budget,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32761566,"Chancellor George Osborne has said that he will deliver a new Budget on 8 July.He claimed it would have ""a laser-like focus"" on raising productivity and living standards.He said he was making the unusual move of having a second Budget in one year in order to ""deliver on the commitments we have made to working people"".Labour said the chancellor would have to set out ""who is going to pay"" for what it called ""uncosted promises"" in the election campaign.Speaking outside 11 Downing Street, the chancellor gave a broad outline of his plans for the forthcoming Budget but refused to be drawn on the details, including the Conservatives' planned £12bn of welfare cuts.""I don't want to wait to deliver on the commitments we have made to working people,"" he said.""It will continue with the balanced plan we have to deal with our debts, invest in our health service and reform welfare to make work pay.""But there will also be a laser-like focus on making our economy more productive so we raise living standards across our country.""We're going to put Britain into good shape for the long term.""The last Budget was held on 18 March and included tax cuts for first-time house buyers.Writing in the Sun, Mr Osborne admitted it was ""unusual"" to have two Budgets in the same year, but he wanted to turn ""promises made in the election into a reality"".Again, Mr Osborne did not specifically outline how the Conservatives plan to fulfil a pledge to cut £12bn in welfare spending but said he wants to make the welfare system ""fair for the people who pay for it"".He writes: ""We will protect the NHS and give it more funding each and every year, while making savings across Whitehall. ""We'll crack down hard on tax avoidance and aggressive tax planning by the rich - because everyone should pay their fair share.  ""We will always protect the most vulnerable, but we also need a welfare system that's fair to the people who pay for it. If you can work you should be working, so we'll take the next steps in our benefit reforms to make sure that happens.""Second, we've got to go on helping businesses create jobs in Britain, so we move towards full employment. That means facing a hard truth: in Britain we produce about a quarter less for every hour we work than countries like America or Germany. Fixing that long-running productivity weakness is the big challenge for the next five years.""So in the Budget we'll spend less on welfare, and instead invest to create three million more apprenticeships, so that young people can learn a trade, get better jobs and earn more.""After the Budget in March independent forecaster the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said that Mr Osborne needed to spell out exactly how he plans to cut £12bn from welfare spending.Of those £12bn planned cuts, £2bn were outlined ahead of the general election - all the cuts are supposed to be in place by 2017-18.Labour's shadow energy and climate change secretary, Caroline Flint, accused the Tories of making ""a number of uncosted promises"" during the election campaign.She told the BBC: ""It will be interesting to see who is going to pay for those uncosted policies when they bring the Budget in July."""
2015-05-14,Farage should take a break - Carswell,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32761766,"UKIP leader Nigel Farage ""needs to take a break now"", the party's only MP Douglas Carswell has said.Writing in the Times, Mr Carswell said he admired Mr Farage, but questioned his ""ill-advised"" comments about HIV patients, made in a TV leaders' debate.Mr Farage ruled out quitting as leader on BBC's Question Time on Thursday, saying he had ""phenomenal"" support.It follows a bitter internal row within the party, which has seen two of Mr Farage's senior aides resigning.In his article, Mr Carswell said that ""knowing how difficult it is to lead a party makes me admire Nigel Farage all the more"".""I know that I never could,"" he added, stressing that he would find it ""impossible to simultaneously lead UKIP, be the voice of the party in the Commons, represent my Clacton constituents and at the same time be a husband and a dad"".However, he said that ""even leaders need to take a break"", adding: ""Nigel needs to take a break now.""He described Mr Farage as ""inspirational"", saying the party had ""done extraordinarily well"" under his leadership but now needed to ""consider carefully what comes next"".Earlier, Mr Farage challenged his critics to decide whether they wanted him to stay in the party.He said he had ""massive"" support from UKIP MEPs, donors and party members to continue in the role, suggesting one person, whom he did not name, was ""agitating for change"".Addressing the prospect of a future EU referendum, Mr Carswell said: ""All of us UKIP supporters should ask one question; Is what I'm doing at this moment making an 'out' vote more likely? If it isn't, stop it and do something else.""He also criticised Mr Farage's comments about HIV patients during the TV leaders' debate last month.While debating about the NHS, Mr Farage said: ""You can come into Britain from anywhere in the world and get diagnosed with HIV and get the retro-viral drugs that cost up to £25,000 per year per patient.""Mr Carswell wrote: ""By all means we should highlight the problem of health tourism. But we need to admit that using the example of HIV patients to make the point was ill-advised.""He said the party needed to strike ""the right tone"" and added: ""UKIP has been at its most persuasive when we have been most optimistic.""Anger is never a great way to motivate people - at least not for very long.""The party has been beset by wrangling since Mr Farage agreed to stay on as leader, days after standing down after failing to get elected in Thanet South.He had pledged before the general election that he would quit the post if he failed to get elected to Parliament.Matthew Richardson has left the party, following claims from MEP Patrick O'Flynn that Mr Farage had fallen under the influence of ""inexperienced"" advisers. UKIP has also confirmed the departure of Mr Farage's chief of staff Raheem Kassam.UKIP got nearly four million votes at the election, but returned only one MP - former Conservative Mr Carswell in the Clacton constituency."
2015-05-14,Tributes as ex-Conservative MP dies,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-northamptonshire-32764540,"Tributes have been paid to former Conservative MP Sir Peter Fry who has died at the age of 83.Sir Peter, who had been ill for a year, was MP for Wellingborough and Rushden, in Northamptonshire, for 28 years from 1969 until his defeat by Labour in 1997.In government he was notable as an expert on transport issues.Current Wellingborough Conservative MP Peter Bone said Sir Peter remained ""extremely well thought of"".""When I was canvassing in the last election, people were still talking about him. They absolutely loved how he helped them and he was a highly-regarded local MP,"" Mr Bone said.""He stood up for what was right rather than what the party line was. In those days - the John Major years - it was much more difficult to stand up against the party machine. He had strong views on Europe.""Sir Peter started his career as an insurance broker, joining the Wycombe Young Conservatives in 1949 and the Oxford University Conservative Association in 1951.He went on to become a Conservative councillor on Buckinghamshire County Council between 1961 and 1967.Wellingborough mayor-elect Barry Graves also paid tribute to Sir Peter, remembering him as a ""very strong constituency MP"".""I remember going out and canvassing with him and he would go everywhere. He knew the area and the people. He was very much a man of the local constituency.""He was ""a very approachable man"", Mr Graves added.Sir Peter was knighted in 1994. "

2015-05-14,PM will 'look at' powers proposals,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32746049,"David Cameron has said he would ""look at"" any proposals for further powers for Scotland but wants to get the Smith Commission plans implemented first.The prime minister was speaking after meeting Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon in Edinburgh.Mr Cameron said he made a ""commitment"" to include a devolution bill in the Queen's Speech later this month.Ms Sturgeon argued the Smith Commission proposals were ""a good starting point"" but did not go far enough.The prime minister has pledged to include a bill on devolution in this month's Queen's Speech which would be based on the cross-party Smith Commission agreement. The Smith proposals included giving Holyrood the power to set income tax rates and bands, as well as control over a share of VAT and some welfare benefits. But Ms Sturgeon's SNP also wants the Scottish Parliament to be given powers over business taxes, employment law, the minimum wage and additional powers over welfare.Speaking after meeting Ms Sturgeon, Mr Cameron told the BBC: ""Let's make sure Smith is implemented in full. I'm going to keep the commitment I made to the people of Scotland. Let's get that done first because it does create a really strong Scottish Parliament.""He added: ""Of course, if people want to make future proposals I'll look at them.""The prime minister again said he did not support full fiscal autonomy for Scotland - the responsibility for all areas of tax and spending except defence and foreign affairs - stating that it would mean £7bn of cuts or extra tax-raising.What Nicola Sturgeon is trying to say is she has a mandate. She has 56 out of the 59 MPs elected in Scotland and she won 50% of the vote - unprecedented here in Scotland.She says that gives her leverage to push David Cameron. David Cameron says he wants to keep the nation together.The language coming out of Westminster last week was very much a cordial one. 'We will listen'.Nicola Sturgeon has warned him that if he doesn't listen, then the people of Scotland will judge him accordingly.Ms  Sturgeon described the hour-long talks at her official residence at Bute House as ""constructive and business-like"". She said Mr Cameron had made a ""commitment"" that the Smith proposals would be implemented ""as agreed"".""But secondly the prime minister agreed that he would look at proposals that we would now send to suggest the areas we can go beyond Smith,"" Ms Sturgeon said.""There was no agreement in terms of the substance of that but we will submit those proposals, the prime minister has said they will consider them and there will be a meeting to look at how we take that further forward.""Referring to her party's success in last week's general election, which saw the SNP win 56 out of 59 Scottish seats, Ms Sturgeon said: ""People in Scotland have now voted fairly convincingly for the SNP and sent a message that we want the Smith Commission proposals to go further and be built on.""The ball is in his court but I'm going into this in good faith.""She added: ""David Cameron and I are a world apart politically but, where we can, I'm determined to do business in the interests of the people of Scotland and across the UK.""She said she would have a ""constructive and business-like"" relationship with the prime minister. The two leaders shook hands on the front steps of Bute House as Mr Cameron arrived. Mr Cameron left the building shortly before 11:00, almost an hour after he had arrived.The two sides agreed to hold more regular discussions in the future, possibly quarterly. "
2015-05-14,Umunna withdraws Labour leader bid,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32748106,"Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna has withdrawn from the Labour party leadership contest, just days after throwing his hat into the ring.The MP, 36, said in a statement that he was not comfortable with the level of pressure and scrutiny that came with being a leadership candidate.Mr Umunna also cited concerns about the impact of the bid on his family.BBC political editor Nick Robinson said the MP's team insisted no ""unwelcome press story"" lay behind the move.But Mr Umunna had been shocked by the level of scrutiny of himself, his mother, sister and girlfriend, he said.You can follow the latest reaction here.A rising star of the party, Mr Umunna was first elected to Parliament in 2010 before joining the shadow cabinet.He confirmed his candidacy for the Labour leadership via a post on his Facebook page on 12 May, saying the party under Ed Miliband had failed to appeal to enough voters in England.But on Friday he said he had not found the leadership bid to be ""a comfortable experience"".I understand that Chuka Umunna has told friends that ""this is not right for me or people close to me. I'm human, the rest of my life is more important to me than politics.""The shadow business secretary has been distressed by the degree of scrutiny he, his family and his girlfriend have come under since he declared his intention to stand for the labour leadership.I am told that this includes reporters waiting outside the houses of relatives late at night.Friends of Mr Umunna deny that he is nervous of not getting the support of enough MPs to run for the leadership; they point out that he already has half the necessary names and that there are some weeks to go.The shadow business secretary now wants to play a leading role in arguing that Britain should stay in the EU and does not rule out seeking the leadership in the future.He said he thought he had understood ""the scrutiny and attention a leadership contest would bring"", but added: ""However, since the night of our defeat last week I have been subject to the added level of pressure that comes with being a leadership candidate.""The shadow business secretary said he had wondered if it was too soon for him to stand for the leadership, and ""I fear it was."" He also cited concerns about the impact on ""the rest of one's life"" and those close to him.""Consequently, after further reflection, I am withdrawing my candidacy,"" he said.Mr Umunna said he would continue to serve as shadow business secretary and hoped to ""play a leading role"" in Labour's campaign to keep the UK in the EU during the forthcoming in/out referendum.Commenting on the news, Labour former culture secretary Ben Bradshaw - who is expected to run for deputy leader - said Mr Umunna was a ""terrible loss"" to the field.He told the BBC's Daily Politics the Streatham MP had been the candidate the Conservative Party ""feared the most"".""And if it's the result of pressure on an extended family or an extended group of friends, I think that's a very sad reflection on our political culture,"" he said.Chuka Umunna feels ""liberated"", he told me, by his decision to quit the Labour leadership race.He hopes to be given a good role (shadow chancellor, I wonder?) by whoever becomes Labour leader. And I expect he'll become very high profile in the campaign to keep Britain in Europe, which is increasingly looking like it will be next May.He'll endorse a candidate in the next four weeks before nominations close. It will be very interesting to see who he piles in behind.Read more from Allegra (see post 13.23).Former Labour leader Lord Kinnock said he thought Mr Umunna had made the right decision.He said: ""If he felt in his soul that he wasn't prepared to subject himself - and more importantly his family - to the kind of attention which is fairly typical, sadly, these days, he has done absolutely the right thing.""There is no point at all in inflicting avoidable, unnecessary misery on those you love most.""Leadership contender Mary Creagh said she had ""huge respect"" for Mr Umunna, telling BBC Radio 4's World at One programme it took ""courage"" to withdraw from the leadership race.Mr Umunna was ""a big beast"" and would play a ""big role"" in the future of the Labour Party, she added.Yvette Cooper, Andy Burnham, Liz Kendall and Mary Creagh have already thrown their hats into the ring for Labour's top job while a number of other potential candidates, including Dan Jarvis, Alan Johnson and David Lammy, have ruled themselves out. Candidates must secure nominations from 34 colleagues - 15% of the party's MPs - by 15 June to make it on to ballot papers, which will be sent to members in August ahead of the leader's election a month later."

However, Mr Justice Stuart Smith at Southwark Crown Court said there was a ""very strong likelihood"" a custodial sentence would follow.The jury heard how Mote submitted numerous false expenses claims for payment for work that organisations had allegedly carried out on his behalf.Mote claimed the money was to pay whistleblowers in cash through third parties. He also said he had been ""targeted for being an anti-EU MEP.""During his time an MEP he also made £250,000 legitimate expenses claims.No date has been set for the sentencing."

2015-05-14,Round-up: BBC experts' analysis,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/election-2015-32650417,"The political future of the United Kingdom has become clearer after the results of the general election emerged around the country.David Cameron says he hopes to govern for all of the UK after the Conservatives took 331 seats - enough to form a slender majority in the Commons.Labour has been all but wiped out by the SNP in Scotland and suffered a disappointing set of results elsewhere, while the Lib Dems are left with just eight MPs after many party heavyweights such as Vince Cable and Danny Alexander lost their seats.So with battles won and lost and the fall-out and celebrations beginning, BBC correspondents examine the implications and challenges that lie ahead for the new government - and for those whose political careers have been ended by voters.No pollster, no pundit, no political leader saw it coming - not even David Cameron himself.Governing parties don't gain seats. Parties that have implemented painful cuts and are promising more certainly don't. Until that is the Conservative Party did - achieving what had seemed to be Mission Impossible - a Tory majority.Until that is David Cameron's personal triumph which triggered the near simultaneous resignation of his three principle opponents - Messrs Miliband, Clegg and Farage.They did so in part because they helped to crush their partners in coalition these last five years - reducing the Liberal Democrat parliamentary party to a size when it can fit into two London taxis and still have two seats to spare.In part because the extraordinary tidal wave of support for the SNP swept dozens of once safe Labour seats away.In part because Nigel Farage persuaded millions to vote for him but secured just one seat - not, though, the one he was standing in.Read more from Nick Robinson hereThe question uppermost in the prime minister's mind as he assembles his new government is how to keep the kingdom united.""Above all I want to bring our country together,"" he revealed after the result, ""to reclaim a mantle we should never have lost - the mantle of one nation, one United Kingdom"".Looking at the political landscape from Land's End today is very different to the view from John O'Groats.A sea of Conservative and Unionist blue dominates the scene across much of England, while a field of SNP nationalist yellow stretches to the horizon and beyond from the north.David Cameron's greatest challenge is to prevent the union he supports being torn apart by mutual resentment - resentment from Scotland at a Westminster government dominated by English Tories, and resentment from England at the preferential treatment people think is being given to the Scots.Those who assumed the future of the Union had been safeguarded by the Scottish referendum must think again.Read more from Mark Easton hereOne thing is rock-solid true: the Conservatives who worked on this campaign are as surprised by the result as the pollsters, pundits, politicians and general population.Maybe they shouldn't be - the economy is in good shape and the Conservatives had incumbency advantage.But when I travelled back from the prime minister's last rally with a group of exhausted Conservative campaign officials it was clear that 290 seats was a hoped-for target.No-one talked about anything over 300 seats, and no-one even mentioned an overall majority.So what special sauce pushed David Cameron into No 10 with a Commons majority?Mr Cameron had two simple messages in the campaign and he rarely veered away from them; the first - the economy is in good shape and the recovery is threatened by Labour. And the second - the SNP would hold a Labour-led government to ransom.Read more from Jonny Dymond hereBrian Taylor, BBC political editor, ScotlandOf all the comments on the overnight apocalypse, undoubtedly the most straightforward came from a defeated Scottish Labour MP.Since there were quite a few of them, let me narrow the focus a little. Come on down, Tom Harris.Mr Harris had plainly anticipated defeat. Nonetheless, he looked suitably lugubrious as his fate was confirmed.Why, he was asked eagerly, had Labour lost? ""Because we did not win enough votes.""Psephologically, it is perfect. Complete in itself. Psychologically, it sums up Labour's gloom without descending into subsidiary matters such as leadership, strategy and the rest. As a forward-thinking strategy, it is ideal. Win more votes. Simple.Read more from Brian Taylor hereThis has been an election which may have more profound consequences than almost any in living memory.We now face a generational decision about our future in Europe, with an EU referendum in two years' time almost certain.There will also be serious questions about the future of the Union, following an SNP landslide that has turned Scotland into a virtual one-party state.David Cameron's victory also represents a colossal achievement.Only once before in recent history has an incumbent government increased its majority - and that was Mrs Thatcher in her prime in the 1980s.It is also a significant personal victory for Mr Cameron and a rebuff for those in his party who had become increasingly sceptical about his ability to win.But while it may represent a defeat for those Tories who saw this election as a potential opportunity to rid themselves of David Cameron, he must now govern with a wafer-thin majority.For the SNP, their stunning victory can only increase the pressure on Nicola Sturgeon to include a commitment to a second independence referendum in her party's manifesto for next year's Scottish elections.It is an election which has not just defied all the predictions of the pollsters and pundits - but which may yet prompt the most fundamental re-casting of British politics for a generation.Read more from Norman Smith hereAfter an extraordinary night, some brief conclusions:Read more from James Landale hereIs this the end of the union?That is the question many people will be asking this morning after the party which has fought for Scottish independence for 80 years swept to victory.The answer from the jubilant Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon is a firm ""No"".She insists that her MPs will speak for all of Scotland, not just for the 45% who voted for the country to leave the United Kingdom last September.In the closing hours of the most extraordinary election campaign which anyone in Scotland can remember, Ms Sturgeon turned to talk of ""legitimacy.""That will be her watchword in the coming days as she argues that the prime minister cannot ignore the democratic will of the Scottish people.Politically, Scotland and England this morning look and feel like very different countries.Read more from James Cook hereAfter weeks of chatter about an election too close to call, it wasn't that close at all.David Cameron will be continuing as our prime minister.So, what is all this likely to mean?A referendum on whether the UK stays in, or leaves, the European Union, within the next two-and-a-half years.A race to be the next leader of the Labour Party.A race to be the next leader of the Liberal Democrats.And a huge new presence of Scottish National Party MPs at Westminster.And so here's another thing we know for certain this morning: Politics ain't going to be boring any time soon.Read more from Chris Mason hereFor Labour the story of their terrible night is rapidly turning into the search for a new leader. So who will that be?Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, is almost certain to run.  Even before this election, both he and another almost inevitable candidate, Chuka Umunna, had raised eyebrows inside the party at the work they had put in, preparing the ground with members and the unions for potential bids.Yvette Cooper, before the election, was still thought not to have made up her mind over whether to run. That decision has been made perhaps a little easier as her husband, Ed Balls, has lost his seat.She is certainly potentially in the frame, along with two lesser known names - Liz Kendall and Dan Jarvis - two MPs who were only elected in 2010 for the first time. This could be their moment. But whoever is in the job, they face a monumental task.Read Laura Kuenssberg's Twitter hereSterling is up (the most for seven years against the euro), share prices are up (especially bank shares like Lloyds and RBS, and energy shares such as Centrica), government bond prices are up.To state the obvious, investors love the Tories' general election victory.There are a few reasons.One (no surprise here) is that Labour's threat of breaking up banks and imposing energy price caps has been lifted.Second is that investors have been discounting days and weeks of wrangling after polling day over who would form the government - and so they are semi-euphoric that we already know who's in charge.Third, many investors tend to be economically conservative and instinctively Conservative.But although the City may be a bit drunk on the result, its pleasure in Ed Miliband's and Ed Balls' humiliation may be making it a bit blind - perhaps dangerously so - to some bumps in the economic road ahead.Read more from Robert Peston hereNigel Farage dreamed of holding the balance of power, but in the end his UKIP party is now worse off than when it came into the election.At the seventh time of asking he was rejected - this time by the people of Thanet South. It was a similar story in Rochester and Strood where Mark Reckless, who sensationally defected from the Tories last year, was also sent packing.In seats on UKIP's target list, like Thurrock in Essex, the party failed to make gains. In Grimsby - where Mr Farage went twice in the last six weeks - they came third.UKIP got around four million votes - with especially strong showings in north-east and south-east England - but it's ended up with just one MP, and a vacancy at the top. This has led to UKIP attacking the current system of choosing MPs, which it's described as ""busted"" and ""dysfunctional"".In one sense, this campaign was a complete failure and it's left an aftermath of angry voters, and others wondering if the UKIP bubble has burst.Read Robin Brant's Twitter hereI monitored 91 GB-wide voting intention polls during the 2015 election campaign and found nothing in them to prepare me for the final outcome.The good news for the pollsters was that their share for the Lib Dems was pretty close, as were the shares for UKIP, the Greens and the catch-all category of Others.The bad news for the polling industry was that the crucial shares for Conservative and Labour were the ones where they came most adrift.When all the qualifications of margins of error are allowed, there did appear to be a systematic overstatement of the Labour share and an equally systematic understatement of the Conservative one.It is for the pollsters to decide whether to conduct a review of their performance but I trust they will avoid the initial knee-jerk reaction of the immediate aftermath of the 1992 polls debacle.This general election performance follows the performance of the polls in the 2014 Scottish referendum where the choice was simply binary and yet all the polls were out by between 4-6%.Something is wrong. A lot of us would like to know what it is.Read more from David Cowling hereThe words ""political earthquake"" have been translated into numerous European languages, making front page news across the continent.While Britons now examine the domestic minutiae of the election result, here in mainland Europe the vote means one thing: a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU. And that has the potential to create an earthquake of its own.The guardian of the EU treaties Mr Cameron wants to change - Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker - has said again he'd listen to what Britain's new government proposed.Read more from Katya Adler here"

2015-05-14,A history of political plots,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32749971,"Nigel Farage has apparently seen off a challenge to his leadership of UKIP - a move described by his former election strategist as a ""coup"". He's not the only party leader to face an attempted ousting. But can you recover from such a revolt?In 2006, the Labour prime minister was the target of what became known as the ""curry house conspiracy"" - a coup to remove him and install his chancellor, Gordon Brown, as prime minister.It would lead to several of the plotters' resignations - but not Mr Blair's. However, it was successful to a degree in that it forced the party leader into naming a departure date.The move against him was reportedly masterminded by Tom Watson, a defence minister at the time, who was also rumoured to have had a secret meeting with Mr Brown on the eve of the revolt.Apparently, Mr Watson and three fellow West Midlands MPs - Sion Simon, David Wright (both ministerial aides) and Khalid Mahmood - met over a biryani at a Wolverhampton curry house to discuss the PM's future, before dispatching a missive calling for him to quit.The letter - which attracted the support of a number of normally loyal Labour MPs - was leaked to the press, and ultimately resulted in Mr Watson's resignation.In his parting letter, the West Bromwich East MP took a shot at the prime minister, who he said should step down in the interests of party and country.Mr Blair denounced his actions and branded the former minister ""disloyal, discourteous and wrong"", saying he would have sacked him if he had not resigned.But Mr Watson's departure was swiftly followed by the resignations of six other junior members of government - who had also signed the rebel letter - in protest at the prime minister's refusal to say when he would step down as Labour leader.The whole affair resulted in Mr Blair announcing his intention to step aside within 12 months - which he duly did, on 27 June 2007.But it did nothing to quash internal dissent and speculation in the party over the future leadership of the party.Labour prime minister Gordon Brown found his leadership under threat in 2009 after one of his cabinet ministers dramatically quit the government and called for him to resign.Work and Pensions Secretary James Purnell - a former aide to Tony Blair - resigned from his post after the polls closed in the local and European elections, in which Labour was forecast to do badly.Explaining his decision to quit, Mr Purnell said the prime minister made a Conservative victory ""more, not less, likely"".It was Mr Brown's first direct challenge from a cabinet minister - but it would not topple the Labour leader as senior members of government refused to follow Mr Purnell's lead.Mr Brown was safe for the time being. But several months later, in January 2010, a fresh leadership challenge was mounted by two senior former Labour cabinet ministers.Geoff Hoon and Patricia Hewitt wrote to all Labour MPs, saying the party was ""deeply divided"" over Mr Brown's leadership and that the best way to resolve the issue was by way of secret ballot.They insisted it was not an ""attempted coup"" but a necessary step to resolve divisions within the party.But the duo could only muster the public support of a handful of backbenchers long-opposed to Mr Brown, with the majority of the party's MPs less than impressed by the move, which came just weeks before the general election.As the day wore on, a succession of cabinet ministers came out to back the PM, suggesting there was little momentum behind the plot - although it was noted that several were not exactly gushing in their support of Mr Brown.As history tells us, neither leadership challenge bore fruit but they reflected the internal doubts and divisions over Mr Brown at the helm.As leadership toppling attempts go, this one in 2014 was regarded as a particularly ""botched"" and ""shambolic coup"". Indeed, former Lib Dem leader Lord (Paddy) Ashdown described the move as a ""plot of deep malice"".Its instigator, Lord (Matthew) Oakeshott - a close ally of the-then Business Secretary Vince Cable - tried to unseat Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg.The peer was found to have commissioned secret polls suggesting the party would do better at the 2015 general election without Mr Clegg in the driving seat.The man Lord Oakeshott had long had in mind to take Mr Clegg's place - Mr Cable, who was on government business in China at the time - was forced to publicly condemn his friend's actions and state his backing for Mr Clegg.But Lord Oakeshott said the business secretary had in fact known about his polls and their findings.Nevertheless, the peer - who was denounced by the Lib Dem leadership for spending money that could have been spent on campaigning - quit the party, and issued a warning shot on his way out about the Lib Dems' future prospects.Mr Cable largely emerged unscathed but he faced questions about his loyalty to the leader. Although the two sought to put paid to reports of a rift with a (painfully awkward, 'nothing to see here, folks') stage-managed pint in a pub.Although the revolt failed, and Mr Clegg remained at the helm, the Lib Dems did go on to suffer a trouncing at the general election, losing nearly 50 of its MPs - one of them, Mr Cable himself - prompting his leader to quit.The Conservatives have a reputation for being more ruthless than their party rivals when it comes to getting rid of leaders they sense are no longer effectual.But, in 1995, Prime Minister John Major - tired of persistent rumours of a leadership challenge - decided to take the bull by the horns and trigger a surprise leadership election to silence his detractors.His own backbenchers had questioned Mr Major's ability to unite and lead the party, which was deeply divided over Europe.So ""put up or shut up"", he told them as he tendered his resignation as Conservative Party leader but not prime minister.But then stepped forward eurosceptic MP John Redwood, who resigned from the cabinet in order to contest Mr Major's leadership.This was unexpected by many, as the PM had said there had been assurances from his cabinet that none would stand against him.But Mr Major went on to win the ensuing election with a comfortable defeat over his challenger, who was not included in the PM's consequent cabinet reshuffle.No further contested leadership election took place until after the Conservatives' defeat at the 1997 general election, paving the way for William Hague to take over the running of the party.Not all attempts to oust a party leader end in failure: as Margaret Thatcher found out to her peril.With three electoral victories under her belt, the Conservative prime minister's downfall would come at the hands of her own party - not the voters.It was on 1 November 1990 when Geoffrey (now Lord) Howe - one of Mrs Thatcher's longest-serving ministers - resigned over differences with the party leader over Europe.In his now infamous speech on the floor of the House of Commons, he attacked the PM's policies and leadership style, comparing being one of her cabinet ministers to opening the batting at cricket only to find his bat had been ""broken... by the team captain"".It sparked the beginning of the end of the 11-year Thatcher reign.Michael (now Lord) Heseltine seized on the opportunity to challenge the prime minister in the ensuing leadership contest, from which she would eventually withdraw and John Major emerge as her successor. Reflecting on the revolt and its implications on the Conservative Party, Baroness Thatcher's biographer Charles Moore wrote: ""Because the coup was unjustified, and so trust broke down, the politics of the next 15 years were those of civil war."""
2015-05-14,Election swings and roundabouts,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-32741924,"If election manifesto claims are all about smoke and mirrors, should we now add swings and roundabouts to the political metaphor?There's an intriguing aspect to the general election results in the Midlands that puzzled me.It's the striking contrast in the swings between Labour and the Conservatives.David Cameron and his campaign strategists knew they were home and dry when Nuneaton was the first Midlands marginal to declare.It was not only a Tory hold but a swing to the Conservatives from Labour of 3%.I was in the Nottingham suburb of Beeston awaiting the result of the Broxtowe count. Would its high profile Conservative MP Anna Soubry survive a red surge?Nuneaton set the pattern. Across the Midlands, both east and west, there was a uniform swing of between three and four per cent to the Tories - Warwickshire North 3%, Amber Valley 4%, Derbyshire South 4% and Sherwood 4%. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan topped the Tory swingometer in the Midlands marginals with 5% in Loughborough.Yet in the big cities, it was a very different story. The swing went to Labour.So in Nottingham East they enjoyed a 6% swing, Nottingham South 5.8%, Leicester South 7.3%, Leicester West 5%, Birmingham Hall Green 12%, Birmingham Hodge Hill 8%.If swings to Labour on this scale had gone beyond the city ring road roundabouts and into the suburbs, Ed Miliband would have become prime minister by now.In confidence, one senior Labour insider in Nottingham told me its success in the city wards was down to organisation, experience and its teams of activists.""We won the ground war. If Nottingham's city boundaries were extended into Sherwood and Broxtowe, we would have won those constituencies as well,"" he told me.Labour leadership candidate, Leicester West's Liz Kendall has identified her party's problem beyond the ring road roundabout.It's about reaching out to Middle England.""We need to show people that we understand their aspirations and ambitions for the future,"" she told the Sunday Times.The problem for Labour was that Middle England was not interested in what the party offered…and still isn't. The Cameron brand worked its magic in those Midlands marginals... it'll take something or someone special to break up that ballot box relationship."
2015-05-14,Royal 'lobbying',https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32740154,"Prince Charles sent 27 letters to then Prime Minister Tony Blair and members of his government between September 2004 and March 2005, ""despite the Freedom of Information Act!"" as the prince joked in one.But did his suggestions and concerns have any bearing on the behaviour of Mr Blair's government?The request: Prince Charles expresses his worries over an EU directive on complementary medicines ""which is… effectively outlawing the use of certain herbal extracts"".  Mr Blair replied, offering moral support and practical help. He agreed that ""the implementation as it is currently planned is crazy"" and set out an action plan that included delaying implementation for all existing products to 2011. What happened: Herbal products were not required to be authorised until 2011, just as Mr Blair had promised. Prince Charles continues to sell his own brand of complementary products, Duchy Herbals, through Boots and Waitrose. The request: Writing to Mr Blair, the prince expresses a ""growing sense of anxiety"" that the Hill Farming Allowance, which supports farmers working on Britain's uplands, could be scrapped. In his reply, the prime minister said he understood that the Hill Farm Allowance would continue until 2007. What happened: The allowance lasted until the end of Labour's tenure in 2010, when it was abolished.The request: Just 18 months after the US-led invasion of Iraq, Prince Charles raised the issue of poor performance of Lynx helicopters in high temperatures, saying: ""I fear that this is just one more example of where our Armed Forces are being asked to do an extremely challenging job (particularly in Iraq) without the necessary resources.""Mr Blair replied: ""On the subject of the Lynx helicopter, the limitations of the existing platform, particularly in the extremely challenging environment within Iraq, are well recognised by the Ministry of Defence."" He added that replacement of the helicopters would be a priority. What happened: Mr Blair's comments go much further than what he was saying about the subject at the time. In the event, though, the fleet was not fully upgraded until 2011.The request: Prince Charles lamented that the government's TB prevention plans might not ""include a commitment to deal with the badger problem in the immediate future"" and pushed strongly for a cull, saying: ""All I can say is that I do urge you to look again at introducing a proper cull of badgers where it is necessary.""Mr Blair sympathised, saying he could ""personally see the case for culling badgers"". However, he was unwilling to commit to a cull.  What happened: Culling trials were conducted from 1998-2005. The final results, published in 2008, said that the badger cull could ""make no meaningful contribution"" to curbing bovine TB. It wasn't until 2013 that a full culling programme began in two pilot areas. These ended with the conclusion that the pilots had been neither humane nor effective at curbing the spread of TB.The request: Then Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell wrote to Prince Charles to say she had decided to give parts of the historic Smithfield meat market Grade II listed status, and was trying to persuade deputy prime minister John Prescott to ""call in"" the planning application to prevent demolition of other parts of the site. She had been swayed by evidence provided by Sir Neil Cossons, who was English Heritage chair at the time, after he had been asked by the prince to add his support. Prince Charles replied that he was ""extremely glad to read of your appreciation of the value of this group of buildings"". According to the Guardian, market workers desperate to see the redevelopment of the site invited the prince to meet them to discuss it, but his office said he was ""unlikely to accept as he did not want to interfere in the planning process"".What happened: Smithfield market is still the subject of planning battles a decade on. Successive planning applications have been refused by ministers. Last year then Communities Secretary Eric Pickles rejected plans for an office development on the site, stating that ""the extent of damage that the application would cause to the important heritage assets at Smithfield runs entirely counter to national and policy objectives intended to protect such assets from harm"".In March, the Museum of London announced a move from its current Barbican site to the Smithfield market building."
2015-05-14,Election fallout,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32703139,"""Some of those gimmicks - that tombstone, whatever idiot thought that up I do not know!""I was talking to the former Mayor of Crawley in Sussex, John Mortimer, in the town's Labour Supporters Club about the vexed question of what went wrong, and where Labour should go next. This seat is one of those southern seats Labour hoped to take, but failed.I hear a whole range of views in the club.""They didn't give nothing to depend on, they should be clear, and a little bit more down to Earth."" ""Good party, wrong leader, they don't look after business enough.""Councillor John Stanley tells me: ""I think in a way we did go too left, but now we can go a bit centre-left, or centre, depending who the new leader is.""The former mayor sums up the mood on the doorstep: ""Whatever we told them, they didn't believe us.""  Expect to hear all those views, and more, in the coming leadership contest. Step back from the angst of supporters, and it may not be that hard to see why Labour failed.  An economic recovery, hailed by independent organisations as the result of government policy, undid a party that had loudly proclaimed for five years that the coalition's policies would lead to economic disaster. Combine that with an uncharismatic and uninspirational leader, then you might argue no further debate is necessary.Fat chance of that. Defeat breeds resentment, and this one has opened up old divisions.  A chorus of Blairties, led by the man himself, has declared that Ed's problem was ignoring those with aspiration and ambition, failing to appeal to those running business. Incidentally, I've been ticked off by the perspicacious editor of the New Statesman, Jason Cowley, for using the ""unhelpful"" term ""Blairites"".I can't think of another description that fits Tony, Lord Mandelson, Lord Adonis and David Miliband quite so well. But call them what you will, the message was clear - Ed was too left wing, Labour should move back to the centre, or, if you like, to the right.Reading Mr Blair's pithy analysis, listening to Lord Mandelson's gripping and savage eloquence, describing a party sent out to shout: ""We love the poor and hate the rich,"" and so ignoring the middle, and you realise strong emotions are in play.But back to the future may not be sufficient. Of course elections are won on the centre ground. But grandees grinding axes, affronted by the failure of boys who used to make their tea, may be creating so much noise that they can't hear more insistent sounds.  For there are several elephants trumpeting loudly as they cram into the small space of the shadow cabinet room. Imagine these beasts are as gaily decorated as Berlin buddy bears. One is decked out in red, another in imperial purple bunting, and another, a mammoth, strong tusked and ice rimmed, painted yellow with tartan trimmings.Take the last first. The Scottish wipeout is Labour's biggest problem. Fail to solve it, and Labour can forget ever having a comfortable majority again. It is hard to argue Labour were wiped out in Scotland because the SNP outflanked them to the right with their appeal to the business community and the ambitious and aspirational. But it is true the SNP drew in to people from left, right and centre, just as the modernisers say Labour should. It was the politics of economic self-interest, but cast in a very different light. Tribally sneering at ""the reactionary ideology of nationalism"" as Mr Blair does, will not reach the central belt of Scotland, the middle ground of  Midlothian.What about that purple pachyderm?  In Crawley - in fact in seat after seat - there is a similar pattern.  Labour did, in fact, often increase the size of their vote. So did the Conservatives, usually by a bit more. But the real dynamic was the total collapse of the Lib Dems and the dramatic rise of UKIP. The increase in votes for Nigel Farage's party wasn't translated into parliamentary seats, but, although it is early days in terms of research, it probably hurt Labour a lot. If we believe - and I do - Matthew Goodwin and Rob Ford, authors of Revolt on the Right, these voters are often former Labour supporters - older, less educated, those left behind on the tides of  globalisation, stranded on the shores of post-industrialisation. They may have had too many disappointments to feel much ambition or aspiration. They are a challenge for Labour, and any new leader will spend a good deal of time thinking how to deal with the concerns of Europe and immigration.Whether to share their fears, or confront them will be a big decision.Which brings us to Red Nellie. Those members who still proudly call themselves socialist. This is not about Old Labour - they are more likely to be baristas or barristers than boilermakers. It is easy as an outsider, as a journalist, to treat politics as an intellectual game about how best to win power - but many people, particularly the foot soldiers, particularly after the death of  purely tribal loyalties, are in it because they passionately believe in winning  power to do something specific.Many of them are suspicious of the later incarnations of New Labour, not because it reached an accommodation with wealth and business, but because it seemed to worship at the same altar, to regard the party's core beliefs in redistribution and equality as childish fantasies from a past age.Perhaps to Mr Blair, they are the problem, people who may equate ""ambition"" with greed. They might point out that a man who claims to be worth ""only"" £20m may find it harder than most to squeeze through the eye of a needle to understand their point of view. Most successful Labour leaders will confront the left at some point, but the concerns of this group go to the existential question ""What is the party for?""This is not a polemic - not an argument about what should be done, but a reflection on the complex conundrums that will face any new Labour leader, the tearing apart of the old alliance that made up a Labour majority, and so the political need to satisfy groups with very different, indeed, contradictory demands. But looking for a Social Democratic universal theory of everything may be missing the point. What the party desperately wants is a leader who can pull the disparate threads together and articulate them as common purpose. Whether she or he exists is another matter.Much more on that in the coming months."
2015-05-14,'Take us with you',https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-32736153,"Thousands of people in the north of England have been using the hashtag ""take us with you Scotland"" to express their upset about the result of last week's general election, and Scottish nationalists are welcoming this English minority with open arms. Last Thursday's general election was a rough one for the Labour Party in its traditional stronghold in the north of England. But further to the north, the left-leaning Scottish National Party won nearly every seat it contested. That political contrast has made some left-wing voters in places like Manchester, Leeds and Sheffield look fondly on their neighbours. Since last Thursday's election in Britain the phrase ""take us with you Scotland"" has been used more than 24,000 times. ""Genuinely beginning to wonder if the North of England becoming a part of Scotland would be better for us, I really am,"" tweeted Aaron Miller from Yorkshire. Some cracked jokes under the tag after the North West Motorway Police account, which gives traffic updates, announced that they had ""picked up a pedestrian on the M62 who was trying to walk to Scotland.""After an initial spike of jokes over the weekend, the hashtag really took off when users start to mobilise in support of around a year-old petition on the campaigning site Change.org. The petition calls for the north of England to secede from the rest of the country and join up with Scotland, and more than 12,000 people have signed it.Its creator, a Sheffield resident who calls himself ""Stu Dent"", set it up to coincide with last year's Scottish independence referendum, and he also created a map imagining the boundary of a ""Scotland plus the north"" country.Stu Dent runs the Twitter account Hunters Bar, named after an area of southwest Sheffield which is very popular with - you guessed it - students. Despite the account having thousands of followers on Twitter, when the map was first posted last year, the image was shared only about 100 times - however, in the past week it's been retweeted by thousands. Stu Dent told BBC Trending that he was surprised at how popular his idea has become. ""In hindsight, perhaps I shouldn't have been,"" he said. ""There is a huge frustration in parts of the UK about the things that have happened since 2010.""""I think people need a place to go where they can say 'not in my name! This is not the England I want',"" he added. But in addition to disappointment from some quarters about the election result, there might be another reason why the petition is getting a boost now: the power of the Scottish Nationalists on Twitter. What started as a post-election joke in the North of England was quickly embraced by the so-called ""Cyber Nats"" - and a trend was born.The SNP's social media strategist Ross Colquhoun expressed the party's mood about the hashtag best, in a post which was shared more than 500 times. ""2014: #LetsStayTogether 2015: #TakeUsWithYouScotland What a difference a year makes"" he tweeted.Blog by Hannah HendersonNext story: The sport reporter and the obscene ranter who lost his jobFollow BBC Trending on Twitter @BBCtrending, and find us on Facebook."
2015-05-14,What Britain wants from Europe,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32695399,"David Cameron says he has a mandate to pursue EU reform following the Conservatives' general election victory. The PM, who will be hoping his majority government will give him extra leverage in Brussels, wants to renegotiate the terms of the UK's membership ahead of a referendum by the end of 2017. He has said he will campaign for Britain to remain in the EU if he gets the reforms he wants.Mr Cameron has said he does not want to reveal full details of his negotiating hand but he has given a broad indication, in a series of speeches and newspaper articles, of his priorities when he goes into talks with other EU leaders.These are: The prime minister has said Britain would resist any move towards a European Army and that he wants to free British police forces from EU interference. He has also ruled out Britain joining the euro.But he has placed less emphasis in recent years on demanding changes to EU social policy, such as the maximum 48-hour working week, agency workers, maternity leave and non-discrimination rules.The official UK government position is that a referendum will be held by the end of 2017 but Downing Street sources have said: ""If we can do it earlier we will.""There is speculation David Cameron is planning to hold the vote in 2016 to avoid a clash with French and German elections in 2017.The prime minister wants treaty change but even if the referendum was held in 2017 there may not be enough time to legally incorporate any reforms into a treaty and it would have to be done at a later stage.An early referendum would anger Eurosceptics who believe it would not allow enough time to make the case for exit or negotiate any meaningful concessions.""A rushed process would severely undermine the chances to secure a significant deal that both British business and voters could support and would waste the opportunity of a lifetime,"" Matthew Elliott, chief executive of Business for Britain told Breitbart London.The question is always crucial in any referendum and there is already a debate about what it should be. The Draft European Union (Referendum) Bill, published by the Conservatives in 2013, proposed this form of words: ""Do you think that the United Kingdom should remain a member of the European Union?""Some thought that leaned too far towards the status quo, encouraging a yes vote, and the Electoral Commission said it was not clear and direct enough. The watchdog proposed this form of words instead: ""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union?""The new Conservative government will attempt to repeal the Human Rights Act, which requires UK courts to treat the European Court of Human Rights as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. The European Court of Human Rights is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe (CoE), which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine.The freedom for people to move around Europe, enshrined in the EU treaties, works in parallel with the other three basic freedoms in the single market: freedom of goods, capital and services.It is likely to be a ""red line"" for other EU leaders, who do not want to see it eroded.Mr Cameron has steered clear of tackling it directly - for example by asking for an emergency ""brake"" on free movement, or a cap on numbers - focusing instead on reducing the incentive provided by welfare payments. In a speech last November, David Cameron set out measures to reduce the number of EU nationals moving to the UK.His main proposals were:Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission, has said he is ready to work with Mr Cameron to ""strike a fair deal for the United Kingdom in the EU"". The leaders of other EU nations have previously warned they are unlikely to support major changes to EU treaties to accommodate British demands. But Mr Cameron's general election victory may have given him extra leverage. ""The ball is very much in the court of the UK now,"" a senior EU official told The Guardian. ""It's up to the British to define what they want."" The key figure will be German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is very keen to keep Britain in the EU but has so far been unwilling to make major concessions to enable that to happen. There are fears that a ""pick and mix"" approach to EU treaties would undermine EU cohesion.Mr Cameron has said there is ""no doubt"" his planned reforms will require changes to the treaties governing the European Union. But this would require the unanimous support of all EU members, and may not be possible within the deadline he has set of a referendum before the end of 2017. Any attempt to change EU laws on free movement would meet fierce resistance from some EU nations, particularly Eastern European states. Mr Juncker has said free movement is non-negotiable.Mr Cameron may find it difficult to get unanimous support for his proposals for a four-year waiting period for migrant workers claiming UK benefits. East European EU members would be likely to oppose this, on the grounds that it would discriminate against their citizens.  Attempts to secure opt-outs for the City are unlikely to go down well with other European leaders.However, there are precedents for EU treaty changes to accommodate some countries' specific concerns - for example, the protocol attached to the Lisbon Treaty for Ireland.Mr Cameron has faced repeated calls to say whether he would campaign for Britain's exit from the EU in the referendum if he fails to get what he wants from the renegotiation process. All he has said is that he will ""rule nothing out"". Some Conservative MPs want Britain to leave the EU no matter what David Cameron manages to renegotiate. A larger group are likely to want more concessions than Mr Cameron has so far indicated he is prepared to demand.Senior backbencher David Davis, who was defeated by Mr Cameron for the Tory leadership in 2005, told the Daily Telegraph the majority of the 332 Conservative MPs want Mr Cameron to negotiate an ""opt-out"" power to stop individual EU laws from applying to Britain. The prime minister has said this would be ""impossible"" without Britain leaving the EU.Mr Davis claims as many as 60 Tory MPs would be prepared to rebel and vote for Britain's exit from the EU if the prime minister fails to deliver.Graham Brady, chairman of the Tory backbench 1922 committee, which represents backbenchers, has urged David Cameron to give all Conservative MPs, including ministers, a free vote in the EU referendum.In January, Mr Cameron warned that serving cabinet ministers would have to quit the government if they wanted to campaign to leave the EU if he had secured the reforms to it he wants.In the 1975 referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Economic Community, as the EU was then called, Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson decided to suspend collective responsibility because his cabinet was split on the issue. Ministers were allowed to vote with their consciences and campaign against each other. The majority of them, including Mr Wilson, joined the Yes camp, but left-wingers, such as Tony Benn, played a leading role in the No campaign. The Yes campaign won easily with 67% of the vote."

2015-05-15,Scots Labour leader Murphy to resign,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32760196,"Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy is to resign next month, he has announced.It comes despite Mr Murphy narrowly surviving a vote of no confidence at a meeting of the party's national executive in Glasgow. Mr Murphy said he would tender his resignation alongside a plan to reform the party.He lost his seat in last week's general election as the SNP won 56 of the 59 Scottish seats, leaving Labour with a single MP in Scotland.Mr Murphy said he wanted to have a successor as leader in place by the summer, and confirmed he would not be standing for a seat at the Scottish Parliament in next year's election. Instead, he said it was time to ""do something else"" and that he believed the party would continue to be divided if he remained as leader. His deputy, Kezia Dugdale MSP, will become acting leader until a permanent successor is found. Mr Murphy had faced calls to resign from several MSPs, trade unions and former MPs in the wake of his party's near wipeout at the general election.He insisted he had decided to stand down ahead of the national executive voting by 17-14 in favour of him staying in the job.Speaking at a media conference after the national executive meeting, he said: ""It is clear that a small minority who didn't accept my election as leader of the Scottish Labour Party just five months ago won't accept the vote of the executive today and that will continue to divide the party.""Today I received more support in the executive vote than I did from members of the executive when I stood for election five months ago.""He said it would be up to the executive whether to accept the reforms he would be proposing before he left the post. But he warned: ""A party in such urgent need of reform blocks those changes at its peril.""The former East Renfrewshire MP said Labour had been crushed between ""two nationalisms"" in Scotland and England.Mr Murphy said he left no legacy of bitterness for anyone in the Labour Party, and the only person he was angry at was the person who blamed Scottish Labour for the party's UK-wide general election defeat - a reference to Unite leader Len McCluskey.And he said that in many ways Scottish Labour was the ""least modernised part of the Labour movement"" and that he wanted his successor to be elected under a one member, one vote system.Mr Murphy added: ""The Labour Party's problem is not the link with trade unions, or even the relationship with Unite members - far from it. It is the destructive behaviour of one high profile trade unionist.""The leader of the Scottish Labour Party doesn't serve at the grace of Len McCluskey, and the next leader of the UK Labour Party should not be picked by Len McCluskey.""Mr McCluskey has been a vocal critic of Mr Murphy's leadership and opposed his appointment in December when Mr Murphy won the contest to replace Johann Lamont.Jim Murphy laughed and joked with Scottish Labour's sole MP as he made his way down the hotel corridor to announce his resignation.He certainly brought energy and dynamism to his election campaign - but all that achieved was Ian Murray in Edinburgh South.So as Mr Murphy bows out, who could replace him?The deputy leader Kezia Dugdale may want to step up or Neil Findlay could try again after challenging last time. Maybe the party's finance spokeswoman Jackie Baillie thinks her steady hand could steer the ship.Jenny Marra is also often talked about as future face of the party.Whoever steps into Jim Murphy's red shoes he or she will have to face a difficult 2016 Holyrood election, to put it mildly.There are also more fundamental questions about how the party can possibly move on as it faces a surging SNP.Mr Murphy was very much a creature of ""New Labour"" - but to today's generation that's old Labour.Party members may start looking for someone with no links to the past, neither a Brownite nor a Blairite. A 'cleanskin' - as the politicos put it - may well help re-connect with voters.That's a long way from now though - even some of the party's opponents may view this latest train wreck with a modicum of sympathy. Ms Lamont had resigned after claiming Scottish Labour was treated like a ""branch office"" by the London-based party leadership.Mr Murphy concluded his speech by saying: ""Scotland needs a strong Labour party; Scotland needs a united Labour party. We have been the greatest force for change in our nation's remarkable history. ""The Scottish Labour party will rise again. It will be under someone else's leadership and I am confident about my party's future.""Harriet Harman MP, acting leader of the UK Labour Party, said it would be for Scottish Labour to choose a new leader. She added: ""As a cabinet minister and leader of his party in Scotland, Jim has been a hugely important figure in the Labour Party. He leaves with the best wishes and thanks of our movement.""Labour peer Lord McConnell, a former Scottish first minister, said the party's problems were ""much deeper than one individual and one affiliate"".He said: ""We have a disconnect locally and nationally with wider Scottish society. ""We have a problem with our political positioning in the post devolution age where the party particularly at the UK level has never been comfortable with success in the Scottish parliament and has always tried to see things through a UK prism rather than a Scottish prism.""We need to find a new generation, a new leader, new generation, new ideas, a fresh approach.""In a tweet, Scottish first minister and SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said: ""I wish Jim Murphy all the very best for the future. Leadership is not easy and he deserves credit for standing up for what he believes in.""Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson also reacted on Twitter, saying: ""Jim Murphy announces a managed exit in order to help the party, which is to his credit. But leaves a tough gig for whoever comes next.""The meeting of Scottish Labour's executive was disrupted by protesters who entered the party's headquarters.Police were called and the protesters, who included persistent anti-austerity activists Sean Clerkin and Piers Doughty-Brown, left the building to protest further from the street outside.The protesters were calling for Mr Murphy to remain as leader to ""finish the job of destroying Scottish Labour"".A Police Scotland spokeswoman said officers had been called and found two protestors on the third floor of the building. She added: ""Both left on police arrival. Advice and assistance was given."""
2015-05-15,Labour contenders clash on spending,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32761561,"Prospective Labour leaders have clashed over Labour's record in government in their first public debate in the race to succeed Ed Miliband.Former cabinet ministers including Yvette Cooper and Andy Burnham defended Labour's fiscal record and spending on schools and hospitals.However, candidates from the 2010 intake of MPs argued that the party spent too much while in office.The debate followed Chuka Umunna's withdrawal from the leadership contest.The remaining candidates appeared at the annual conference of the Progress think tank in London.There was agreement that Labour needed to demonstrate economic credibility to regain power, with shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt telling the meeting that the party needed to be ""trusted with public finances and the family finances"".Mr Hunt, who was first elected to Parliament in 2010 when Labour lost power, argued the last Labour government ""spent too much"" and failed to ""leave enough economic headroom to deal with the economic crisis and the recession"".Shadow health minister Liz Kendall said: ""There's absolutely nothing progressive about spending more on debt interest payments than on educating our children.""But shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: ""The Tories have had a triumph of spin over the facts in saying what they said about the economic record of the last Labour government.""The former chief secretary to the Treasury said the deficit did ""grow too large"" in the government's later years but insisted: ""The last Labour government ran more surpluses in its first term than the Tories did in 18 years.""Yvette Cooper, another former chief secretary to the Treasury, said: ""We should never let anybody tell us that it was too many teachers, doctors or nurses that caused Lehman Brothers bank in New York to crash.""Shadow international development secretary Mary Creagh said: ""People have forgotten the economic credibility that the last Labour government had.""She said Labour had built schools and hospitals that were ""treasured in our communities"".Ms Cooper, Mr Burnham, Ms Kendall and Ms Creagh have declared their intention to run for leader, while Mr Hunt told the conference he would make an announcement next week.At the same event, shadow energy secretary Caroline Flint announced she would be running for deputy leader.The Don Valley MP told the Today programme ahead of the debate that Labour lost the election because ""fundamentally the public did not trust us on the economy"".Exeter MP Ben Bradshaw has already announced a bid to be deputy, saying Labour ""must and could win the next election"", but only if it ""broadens its appeal by adopting sensible, centre-left politics which celebrate wealth creation and entrepreneurship"".Former Labour campaign co-ordinator Tom Watson is reported to be crowd-funding a deputy leadership bid, while Walthamstow MP Stella Creasy has said she is ""open to the question"" of running.Barnsley East MP and shadow transport secretary Michael Dugher - a fierce critic of Ed Miliband's election campaign - is to run Mr Burnham's campaign, according to the website LabourList.It is reported that Mr Burnham also has the backing of Labour peer Lord Falconer, who was lord chancellor and justice secretary under Tony Blair and was close to the former PM.Shadow culture secretary Chris Bryant has signalled his backing for Ms Cooper, tweeting that the next leader must be ""someone who's been tried in the fiery furnace of public opinion"".Mr Hunt said on Friday he would be be attending the debate - along with the other four hopefuls - to ""set out my analysis on how we begin to understand what went so wrong and why"".He added: ""We must use this leadership election to ask some very profound questions.""All voices in the party must be heard so that we can have a full and proper assessment as to why the politics of nationalism triumphed in Scotland and huge swathes of England, and how we have allowed the Conservative Party to present a more compelling vision for Britain to so many millions of people.""Speculation still surrounds shadow business secretary Mr Umunna's decision to pull out on Friday, when he said he was not ""comfortable"" with the ""pressure"" of being a candidate.As well as citing extensive pressure and scrutiny Mr Umunna also said he was ruling himself out because of concerns about the impact of the bid on his family.A rising star of the party, Mr Umunna was first elected to Parliament in 2010 - alongside Tristram Hunt and Liz Kendall - before joining the shadow cabinet.Asked about the candidate who might win, Conservative Chancellor George Osborne said: ""The Labour leadership contest has descended into farce.""But it's not actually about personalities. I don't think the Labour Party any more represents the working people of this country who aspire to a better life."""

I'm not suggesting he takes a break from being leader.""Clearly the national executive has the authority, they're the ruling body. ""I'm told that they made a decision. I'm told it was a procedurally correct decision, he is the leader but I think it's important that as leader he takes a break and I think it's important that we work out how these complex questions are answered by a team.""No one person has all the answers. I'm particularly concerned about tone, making sure we get a tone that ensures that the 27 million people who didn't vote for UKIP last week may be persuaded to vote for us in future.""The party has been beset by wrangling since Mr Farage agreed to stay on as leader, days after standing down after failing to get elected in Thanet South.He had pledged before the general election that he would quit the post if he failed to get elected to Parliament.Senior aide Matthew Richardson has left the party, following claims from MEP Patrick O'Flynn that Mr Farage had fallen under the influence of ""inexperienced"" advisers.UKIP has also confirmed the departure of Mr Farage's chief of staff Raheem Kassam.Mr Farage ruled out quitting as leader on BBC's Question Time on Thursday, saying he had ""phenomenal"" support, and has challenged his critics to decide whether they want to stay in the party.In his article, Mr Carswell had said that ""knowing how difficult it is to lead a party makes me admire Nigel Farage all the more"".""I know that I never could,"" he added, stressing that he would find it ""impossible to simultaneously lead UKIP, be the voice of the party in the Commons, represent my Clacton constituents and at the same time be a husband and a dad"".However, he said that ""even leaders need to take a break"", adding: ""Nigel needs to take a break now.""UKIP got nearly four million votes at the election, but returned only one MP - former Conservative Mr Carswell in the Clacton constituency."
2015-05-15,Coasting schools 'must improve',https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/education-32763097,"Education Secretary Nicky Morgan has said new powers to sack head teachers in coasting schools will show ""it is not OK to be just above the level of failing"". Under the plans, ministers could force schools rated as ""requiring improvement"" and missing new government benchmarks to become an academy.Coasting schools have average results which have often flatlined over time.Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, Mrs Morgan said faster action was needed.She said: ""Our big priorities will be to speed up the process for tackling failing schools; extend our academies programme to tackle 'coasting' schools; and deliver on our commitment to open new free schools.""The proposals will be in a new bill due to be introduced in the Queen's Speech. ""First, we will take new powers to step in from the moment that a school is found to be failing,"" Mrs Morgan said.""From day one, regional schools commissioners will be able to bring in new leadership and support from other excellent schools and heads, and we will speed up the process of turning schools into academies to make sure that new expert leadership is found for all schools that need it as quickly as possible.""She said that coasting schools will be put on an immediate notice to improve and could then be taken over and turned into an academy.They will be required to work with a team of ""expert"" head teachers.She said: ""Those that aren't able to demonstrate a clear plan for improvement will be given new leadership - we know this works in turning schools around.""More than 3,300 schools in England are labelled ""requires improvement"", but the plans are unlikely to cover that many schools.Under the current system, secondary schools are considered to be failing, and therefore eligible for intervention, if fewer than 40% of their students score at least five Cs at GCSE, including English and maths, and they do not meet national averages in pupil progress.In primary schools, the threshold for intervention is if fewer than 65% of pupils get Level 4 in reading, writing and maths and a below average number of pupils make the expected amount of progress.It is not yet clear how coasting schools will be deemed in need of intervention.It is understood that a new category will be devised covering schools which are rated as ""requires improvement"" and which fail to meet a new set of standards on improvement."
2015-05-15,Co-op Group to keep political funding,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-32762858,"The Co-operative Group has decided to continue financially supporting the Co-operative Party, which has strong ties to Labour.Members of the group, the UK's biggest mutual organisation, voted on the issue at their annual general meeting.They passed a motion by 48,579 for, to 39,479 against, to approve ""political expenditures"" of up to £1m which support the movement's objectives.Last year the Co-op Group gave £625,000 to the Co-op Party.This figure was down on the sums donated in previous years. The AGM also included a vote on new corporate governance procedures which would mean members having less of a direct say.The Co-operative Group is still recovering from a period of financial mismanagement and some members have recently expressed concerns about how elections to the board are chosen.The banking arm of the group came close to collapse in 2013, bringing the whole group to a £2.5bn annual loss that year. The Co-op Party includes among its members a number of Labour MPs, including shadow chancellor Chris Leslie and Walthamstow MP Stella Creasy. The politicians stand as candidates of both the Co-operative Party and the Labour Party, and the two political movements have strong historical ties. The board asked the members of the Co-operative Group whether they wanted to continue financially supporting the Co-operative Party, or any other party. Allan Leighton, chairman of the Co-op Group, said: ""There's a clear remit from the members to continue to support the Labour Party.""It allows us to now have a conversation with the Co-op Labour Party about what we do next.""There was also a members' motion on the agenda, put forward by those in favour of making political donations of up to £1m a year.The motion to approve political funding ""not to exceed £1m per annum"" was carried by 55.17% to 44.83%.BBC business correspondent Joe Lynam said: ""To meet a £1.5bn hole in its accounts - mostly stemming from its banking division - the Co-op Group has had to sell off parts of its businesses and hand over majority control of its bank to American hedge funds.""It's also in the process of radically changing the way it runs itself into a more corporate structure with less of a direct say by its members.""He said that ""in theory"", each of the 2.8 million Co-op members could vote on a series of motions about the reforms, as well as how its bosses are paid, and retaining the links to the Co-operative party.One of the group's largest independent societies, Midcounties, recently threatened legal action over a shortlist of six candidates for the group's board being reduced to three - the number of positions available - before a member vote.

2015-05-15,Osborne plans July 'stability' Budget,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32761566,"Chancellor George Osborne has said that he will deliver a new Budget on 8 July.He claimed it would have ""a laser-like focus"" on raising productivity and living standards.He said he was making the unusual move of having a second Budget in one year in order to ""deliver on the commitments we have made to working people"".Labour said the chancellor would have to set out ""who is going to pay"" for what it called ""uncosted promises"" in the election campaign.Speaking outside 11 Downing Street, the chancellor gave a broad outline of his plans for the forthcoming Budget but refused to be drawn on the details, including the Conservatives' planned £12bn of welfare cuts.""I don't want to wait to deliver on the commitments we have made to working people,"" he said.""It will continue with the balanced plan we have to deal with our debts, invest in our health service and reform welfare to make work pay.""But there will also be a laser-like focus on making our economy more productive so we raise living standards across our country.""We're going to put Britain into good shape for the long term.""The last Budget was held on 18 March and included tax cuts for first-time house buyers.Writing in the Sun, Mr Osborne admitted it was ""unusual"" to have two Budgets in the same year, but he wanted to turn ""promises made in the election into a reality"".Again, Mr Osborne did not specifically outline how the Conservatives plan to fulfil a pledge to cut £12bn in welfare spending but said he wants to make the welfare system ""fair for the people who pay for it"".He writes: ""We will protect the NHS and give it more funding each and every year, while making savings across Whitehall. ""We'll crack down hard on tax avoidance and aggressive tax planning by the rich - because everyone should pay their fair share.  ""We will always protect the most vulnerable, but we also need a welfare system that's fair to the people who pay for it. If you can work you should be working, so we'll take the next steps in our benefit reforms to make sure that happens.""Second, we've got to go on helping businesses create jobs in Britain, so we move towards full employment. That means facing a hard truth: in Britain we produce about a quarter less for every hour we work than countries like America or Germany. Fixing that long-running productivity weakness is the big challenge for the next five years.""So in the Budget we'll spend less on welfare, and instead invest to create three million more apprenticeships, so that young people can learn a trade, get better jobs and earn more.""After the Budget in March independent forecaster the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said that Mr Osborne needed to spell out exactly how he plans to cut £12bn from welfare spending.Of those £12bn planned cuts, £2bn were outlined ahead of the general election - all the cuts are supposed to be in place by 2017-18.Labour's shadow energy and climate change secretary, Caroline Flint, accused the Tories of making ""a number of uncosted promises"" during the election campaign.She told the BBC: ""It will be interesting to see who is going to pay for those uncosted policies when they bring the Budget in July."""

If it isn't, stop it and do something else.""He also criticised Mr Farage's comments about HIV patients during the TV leaders' debate last month.While debating about the NHS, Mr Farage said: ""You can come into Britain from anywhere in the world and get diagnosed with HIV and get the retro-viral drugs that cost up to £25,000 per year per patient.""Mr Carswell wrote: ""By all means we should highlight the problem of health tourism. But we need to admit that using the example of HIV patients to make the point was ill-advised.""He said the party needed to strike ""the right tone"" and added: ""UKIP has been at its most persuasive when we have been most optimistic.""Anger is never a great way to motivate people - at least not for very long.""The party has been beset by wrangling since Mr Farage agreed to stay on as leader, days after standing down after failing to get elected in Thanet South.He had pledged before the general election that he would quit the post if he failed to get elected to Parliament.Matthew Richardson has left the party, following claims from MEP Patrick O'Flynn that Mr Farage had fallen under the influence of ""inexperienced"" advisers.

They absolutely loved how he helped them and he was a highly-regarded local MP,"" Mr Bone said.""He stood up for what was right rather than what the party line was. In those days - the John Major years - it was much more difficult to stand up against the party machine. He had strong views on Europe.""Sir Peter started his career as an insurance broker, joining the Wycombe Young Conservatives in 1949 and the Oxford University Conservative Association in 1951.He went on to become a Conservative councillor on Buckinghamshire County Council between 1961 and 1967.Wellingborough mayor-elect Barry Graves also paid tribute to Sir Peter, remembering him as a ""very strong constituency MP"".""I remember going out and canvassing with him and he would go everywhere. He knew the area and the people. He was very much a man of the local constituency.""He was ""a very approachable man"", Mr Graves added.Sir Peter was knighted in 1994. "

2015-05-15,PM will 'look at' powers proposals,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32746049,"David Cameron has said he would ""look at"" any proposals for further powers for Scotland but wants to get the Smith Commission plans implemented first.The prime minister was speaking after meeting Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon in Edinburgh.Mr Cameron said he made a ""commitment"" to include a devolution bill in the Queen's Speech later this month.Ms Sturgeon argued the Smith Commission proposals were ""a good starting point"" but did not go far enough.The prime minister has pledged to include a bill on devolution in this month's Queen's Speech which would be based on the cross-party Smith Commission agreement. The Smith proposals included giving Holyrood the power to set income tax rates and bands, as well as control over a share of VAT and some welfare benefits. But Ms Sturgeon's SNP also wants the Scottish Parliament to be given powers over business taxes, employment law, the minimum wage and additional powers over welfare.Speaking after meeting Ms Sturgeon, Mr Cameron told the BBC: ""Let's make sure Smith is implemented in full. I'm going to keep the commitment I made to the people of Scotland. Let's get that done first because it does create a really strong Scottish Parliament.""He added: ""Of course, if people want to make future proposals I'll look at them.""The prime minister again said he did not support full fiscal autonomy for Scotland - the responsibility for all areas of tax and spending except defence and foreign affairs - stating that it would mean £7bn of cuts or extra tax-raising.What Nicola Sturgeon is trying to say is she has a mandate. She has 56 out of the 59 MPs elected in Scotland and she won 50% of the vote - unprecedented here in Scotland.She says that gives her leverage to push David Cameron. David Cameron says he wants to keep the nation together.The language coming out of Westminster last week was very much a cordial one. 'We will listen'.Nicola Sturgeon has warned him that if he doesn't listen, then the people of Scotland will judge him accordingly.Ms  Sturgeon described the hour-long talks at her official residence at Bute House as ""constructive and business-like"". She said Mr Cameron had made a ""commitment"" that the Smith proposals would be implemented ""as agreed"".""But secondly the prime minister agreed that he would look at proposals that we would now send to suggest the areas we can go beyond Smith,"" Ms Sturgeon said.""There was no agreement in terms of the substance of that but we will submit those proposals, the prime minister has said they will consider them and there will be a meeting to look at how we take that further forward.""Referring to her party's success in last week's general election, which saw the SNP win 56 out of 59 Scottish seats, Ms Sturgeon said: ""People in Scotland have now voted fairly convincingly for the SNP and sent a message that we want the Smith Commission proposals to go further and be built on.""The ball is in his court but I'm going into this in good faith.""She added: ""David Cameron and I are a world apart politically but, where we can, I'm determined to do business in the interests of the people of Scotland and across the UK.""She said she would have a ""constructive and business-like"" relationship with the prime minister. The two leaders shook hands on the front steps of Bute House as Mr Cameron arrived. Mr Cameron left the building shortly before 11:00, almost an hour after he had arrived.The two sides agreed to hold more regular discussions in the future, possibly quarterly. "
2015-05-15,Umunna withdraws Labour leader bid,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32748106,"Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna has withdrawn from the Labour party leadership contest, just days after throwing his hat into the ring.The MP, 36, said in a statement that he was not comfortable with the level of pressure and scrutiny that came with being a leadership candidate.Mr Umunna also cited concerns about the impact of the bid on his family.BBC political editor Nick Robinson said the MP's team insisted no ""unwelcome press story"" lay behind the move.But Mr Umunna had been shocked by the level of scrutiny of himself, his mother, sister and girlfriend, he said.You can follow the latest reaction here.A rising star of the party, Mr Umunna was first elected to Parliament in 2010 before joining the shadow cabinet.He confirmed his candidacy for the Labour leadership via a post on his Facebook page on 12 May, saying the party under Ed Miliband had failed to appeal to enough voters in England.But on Friday he said he had not found the leadership bid to be ""a comfortable experience"".I understand that Chuka Umunna has told friends that ""this is not right for me or people close to me. I'm human, the rest of my life is more important to me than politics.""The shadow business secretary has been distressed by the degree of scrutiny he, his family and his girlfriend have come under since he declared his intention to stand for the labour leadership.I am told that this includes reporters waiting outside the houses of relatives late at night.Friends of Mr Umunna deny that he is nervous of not getting the support of enough MPs to run for the leadership; they point out that he already has half the necessary names and that there are some weeks to go.The shadow business secretary now wants to play a leading role in arguing that Britain should stay in the EU and does not rule out seeking the leadership in the future.He said he thought he had understood ""the scrutiny and attention a leadership contest would bring"", but added: ""However, since the night of our defeat last week I have been subject to the added level of pressure that comes with being a leadership candidate.""The shadow business secretary said he had wondered if it was too soon for him to stand for the leadership, and ""I fear it was."" He also cited concerns about the impact on ""the rest of one's life"" and those close to him.""Consequently, after further reflection, I am withdrawing my candidacy,"" he said.Mr Umunna said he would continue to serve as shadow business secretary and hoped to ""play a leading role"" in Labour's campaign to keep the UK in the EU during the forthcoming in/out referendum.Commenting on the news, Labour former culture secretary Ben Bradshaw - who is expected to run for deputy leader - said Mr Umunna was a ""terrible loss"" to the field.He told the BBC's Daily Politics the Streatham MP had been the candidate the Conservative Party ""feared the most"".""And if it's the result of pressure on an extended family or an extended group of friends, I think that's a very sad reflection on our political culture,"" he said.Chuka Umunna feels ""liberated"", he told me, by his decision to quit the Labour leadership race.He hopes to be given a good role (shadow chancellor, I wonder?) by whoever becomes Labour leader. And I expect he'll become very high profile in the campaign to keep Britain in Europe, which is increasingly looking like it will be next May.He'll endorse a candidate in the next four weeks before nominations close. It will be very interesting to see who he piles in behind.Read more from Allegra (see post 13.23).Former Labour leader Lord Kinnock said he thought Mr Umunna had made the right decision.He said: ""If he felt in his soul that he wasn't prepared to subject himself - and more importantly his family - to the kind of attention which is fairly typical, sadly, these days, he has done absolutely the right thing.""There is no point at all in inflicting avoidable, unnecessary misery on those you love most.""Leadership contender Mary Creagh said she had ""huge respect"" for Mr Umunna, telling BBC Radio 4's World at One programme it took ""courage"" to withdraw from the leadership race.Mr Umunna was ""a big beast"" and would play a ""big role"" in the future of the Labour Party, she added.Yvette Cooper, Andy Burnham, Liz Kendall and Mary Creagh have already thrown their hats into the ring for Labour's top job while a number of other potential candidates, including Dan Jarvis, Alan Johnson and David Lammy, have ruled themselves out. Candidates must secure nominations from 34 colleagues - 15% of the party's MPs - by 15 June to make it on to ballot papers, which will be sent to members in August ahead of the leader's election a month later."

However, Mr Justice Stuart Smith at Southwark Crown Court said there was a ""very strong likelihood"" a custodial sentence would follow.The jury heard how Mote submitted numerous false expenses claims for payment for work that organisations had allegedly carried out on his behalf.Mote claimed the money was to pay whistleblowers in cash through third parties. He also said he had been ""targeted for being an anti-EU MEP.""During his time an MEP he also made £250,000 legitimate expenses claims.No date has been set for the sentencing."

2015-05-15,Round-up: BBC experts' analysis,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/election-2015-32650417,"The political future of the United Kingdom has become clearer after the results of the general election emerged around the country.David Cameron says he hopes to govern for all of the UK after the Conservatives took 331 seats - enough to form a slender majority in the Commons.Labour has been all but wiped out by the SNP in Scotland and suffered a disappointing set of results elsewhere, while the Lib Dems are left with just eight MPs after many party heavyweights such as Vince Cable and Danny Alexander lost their seats.So with battles won and lost and the fall-out and celebrations beginning, BBC correspondents examine the implications and challenges that lie ahead for the new government - and for those whose political careers have been ended by voters.No pollster, no pundit, no political leader saw it coming - not even David Cameron himself.Governing parties don't gain seats. Parties that have implemented painful cuts and are promising more certainly don't. Until that is the Conservative Party did - achieving what had seemed to be Mission Impossible - a Tory majority.Until that is David Cameron's personal triumph which triggered the near simultaneous resignation of his three principle opponents - Messrs Miliband, Clegg and Farage.They did so in part because they helped to crush their partners in coalition these last five years - reducing the Liberal Democrat parliamentary party to a size when it can fit into two London taxis and still have two seats to spare.In part because the extraordinary tidal wave of support for the SNP swept dozens of once safe Labour seats away.In part because Nigel Farage persuaded millions to vote for him but secured just one seat - not, though, the one he was standing in.Read more from Nick Robinson hereThe question uppermost in the prime minister's mind as he assembles his new government is how to keep the kingdom united.""Above all I want to bring our country together,"" he revealed after the result, ""to reclaim a mantle we should never have lost - the mantle of one nation, one United Kingdom"".Looking at the political landscape from Land's End today is very different to the view from John O'Groats.A sea of Conservative and Unionist blue dominates the scene across much of England, while a field of SNP nationalist yellow stretches to the horizon and beyond from the north.David Cameron's greatest challenge is to prevent the union he supports being torn apart by mutual resentment - resentment from Scotland at a Westminster government dominated by English Tories, and resentment from England at the preferential treatment people think is being given to the Scots.Those who assumed the future of the Union had been safeguarded by the Scottish referendum must think again.Read more from Mark Easton hereOne thing is rock-solid true: the Conservatives who worked on this campaign are as surprised by the result as the pollsters, pundits, politicians and general population.Maybe they shouldn't be - the economy is in good shape and the Conservatives had incumbency advantage.But when I travelled back from the prime minister's last rally with a group of exhausted Conservative campaign officials it was clear that 290 seats was a hoped-for target.No-one talked about anything over 300 seats, and no-one even mentioned an overall majority.So what special sauce pushed David Cameron into No 10 with a Commons majority?Mr Cameron had two simple messages in the campaign and he rarely veered away from them; the first - the economy is in good shape and the recovery is threatened by Labour. And the second - the SNP would hold a Labour-led government to ransom.Read more from Jonny Dymond hereBrian Taylor, BBC political editor, ScotlandOf all the comments on the overnight apocalypse, undoubtedly the most straightforward came from a defeated Scottish Labour MP.Since there were quite a few of them, let me narrow the focus a little. Come on down, Tom Harris.Mr Harris had plainly anticipated defeat. Nonetheless, he looked suitably lugubrious as his fate was confirmed.Why, he was asked eagerly, had Labour lost? ""Because we did not win enough votes.""Psephologically, it is perfect. Complete in itself. Psychologically, it sums up Labour's gloom without descending into subsidiary matters such as leadership, strategy and the rest. As a forward-thinking strategy, it is ideal. Win more votes. Simple.Read more from Brian Taylor hereThis has been an election which may have more profound consequences than almost any in living memory.We now face a generational decision about our future in Europe, with an EU referendum in two years' time almost certain.There will also be serious questions about the future of the Union, following an SNP landslide that has turned Scotland into a virtual one-party state.David Cameron's victory also represents a colossal achievement.Only once before in recent history has an incumbent government increased its majority - and that was Mrs Thatcher in her prime in the 1980s.It is also a significant personal victory for Mr Cameron and a rebuff for those in his party who had become increasingly sceptical about his ability to win.But while it may represent a defeat for those Tories who saw this election as a potential opportunity to rid themselves of David Cameron, he must now govern with a wafer-thin majority.For the SNP, their stunning victory can only increase the pressure on Nicola Sturgeon to include a commitment to a second independence referendum in her party's manifesto for next year's Scottish elections.It is an election which has not just defied all the predictions of the pollsters and pundits - but which may yet prompt the most fundamental re-casting of British politics for a generation.Read more from Norman Smith hereAfter an extraordinary night, some brief conclusions:Read more from James Landale hereIs this the end of the union?That is the question many people will be asking this morning after the party which has fought for Scottish independence for 80 years swept to victory.The answer from the jubilant Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon is a firm ""No"".She insists that her MPs will speak for all of Scotland, not just for the 45% who voted for the country to leave the United Kingdom last September.In the closing hours of the most extraordinary election campaign which anyone in Scotland can remember, Ms Sturgeon turned to talk of ""legitimacy.""That will be her watchword in the coming days as she argues that the prime minister cannot ignore the democratic will of the Scottish people.Politically, Scotland and England this morning look and feel like very different countries.Read more from James Cook hereAfter weeks of chatter about an election too close to call, it wasn't that close at all.David Cameron will be continuing as our prime minister.So, what is all this likely to mean?A referendum on whether the UK stays in, or leaves, the European Union, within the next two-and-a-half years.A race to be the next leader of the Labour Party.A race to be the next leader of the Liberal Democrats.And a huge new presence of Scottish National Party MPs at Westminster.And so here's another thing we know for certain this morning: Politics ain't going to be boring any time soon.Read more from Chris Mason hereFor Labour the story of their terrible night is rapidly turning into the search for a new leader. So who will that be?Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, is almost certain to run.  Even before this election, both he and another almost inevitable candidate, Chuka Umunna, had raised eyebrows inside the party at the work they had put in, preparing the ground with members and the unions for potential bids.Yvette Cooper, before the election, was still thought not to have made up her mind over whether to run. That decision has been made perhaps a little easier as her husband, Ed Balls, has lost his seat.She is certainly potentially in the frame, along with two lesser known names - Liz Kendall and Dan Jarvis - two MPs who were only elected in 2010 for the first time. This could be their moment. But whoever is in the job, they face a monumental task.Read Laura Kuenssberg's Twitter hereSterling is up (the most for seven years against the euro), share prices are up (especially bank shares like Lloyds and RBS, and energy shares such as Centrica), government bond prices are up.To state the obvious, investors love the Tories' general election victory.There are a few reasons.One (no surprise here) is that Labour's threat of breaking up banks and imposing energy price caps has been lifted.Second is that investors have been discounting days and weeks of wrangling after polling day over who would form the government - and so they are semi-euphoric that we already know who's in charge.Third, many investors tend to be economically conservative and instinctively Conservative.But although the City may be a bit drunk on the result, its pleasure in Ed Miliband's and Ed Balls' humiliation may be making it a bit blind - perhaps dangerously so - to some bumps in the economic road ahead.Read more from Robert Peston hereNigel Farage dreamed of holding the balance of power, but in the end his UKIP party is now worse off than when it came into the election.At the seventh time of asking he was rejected - this time by the people of Thanet South. It was a similar story in Rochester and Strood where Mark Reckless, who sensationally defected from the Tories last year, was also sent packing.In seats on UKIP's target list, like Thurrock in Essex, the party failed to make gains. In Grimsby - where Mr Farage went twice in the last six weeks - they came third.UKIP got around four million votes - with especially strong showings in north-east and south-east England - but it's ended up with just one MP, and a vacancy at the top. This has led to UKIP attacking the current system of choosing MPs, which it's described as ""busted"" and ""dysfunctional"".In one sense, this campaign was a complete failure and it's left an aftermath of angry voters, and others wondering if the UKIP bubble has burst.Read Robin Brant's Twitter hereI monitored 91 GB-wide voting intention polls during the 2015 election campaign and found nothing in them to prepare me for the final outcome.The good news for the pollsters was that their share for the Lib Dems was pretty close, as were the shares for UKIP, the Greens and the catch-all category of Others.The bad news for the polling industry was that the crucial shares for Conservative and Labour were the ones where they came most adrift.When all the qualifications of margins of error are allowed, there did appear to be a systematic overstatement of the Labour share and an equally systematic understatement of the Conservative one.It is for the pollsters to decide whether to conduct a review of their performance but I trust they will avoid the initial knee-jerk reaction of the immediate aftermath of the 1992 polls debacle.This general election performance follows the performance of the polls in the 2014 Scottish referendum where the choice was simply binary and yet all the polls were out by between 4-6%.Something is wrong. A lot of us would like to know what it is.Read more from David Cowling hereThe words ""political earthquake"" have been translated into numerous European languages, making front page news across the continent.While Britons now examine the domestic minutiae of the election result, here in mainland Europe the vote means one thing: a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU. And that has the potential to create an earthquake of its own.The guardian of the EU treaties Mr Cameron wants to change - Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker - has said again he'd listen to what Britain's new government proposed.Read more from Katya Adler here"

He's not the only party leader to face an attempted ousting. But can you recover from such a revolt?In 2006, the Labour prime minister was the target of what became known as the ""curry house conspiracy"" - a coup to remove him and install his chancellor, Gordon Brown, as prime minister.It would lead to several of the plotters' resignations - but not Mr Blair's. However, it was successful to a degree in that it forced the party leader into naming a departure date.The move against him was reportedly masterminded by Tom Watson, a defence minister at the time, who was also rumoured to have had a secret meeting with Mr Brown on the eve of the revolt.Apparently, Mr Watson and three fellow West Midlands MPs - Sion Simon, David Wright (both ministerial aides) and Khalid Mahmood - met over a biryani at a Wolverhampton curry house to discuss the PM's future, before dispatching a missive calling for him to quit.The letter - which attracted the support of a number of normally loyal Labour MPs - was leaked to the press, and ultimately resulted in Mr Watson's resignation.In his parting letter, the West Bromwich East MP took a shot at the prime minister, who he said should step down in the interests of party and country.Mr Blair denounced his actions and branded the former minister ""disloyal, discourteous and wrong"", saying he would have sacked him if he had not resigned.But Mr Watson's departure was swiftly followed by the resignations of six other junior members of government - who had also signed the rebel letter - in protest at the prime minister's refusal to say when he would step down as Labour leader.The whole affair resulted in Mr Blair announcing his intention to step aside within 12 months - which he duly did, on 27 June 2007.But it did nothing to quash internal dissent and speculation in the party over the future leadership of the party.Labour prime minister Gordon Brown found his leadership under threat in 2009 after one of his cabinet ministers dramatically quit the government and called for him to resign.Work and Pensions Secretary James Purnell - a former aide to Tony Blair - resigned from his post after the polls closed in the local and European elections, in which Labour was forecast to do badly.Explaining his decision to quit, Mr Purnell said the prime minister made a Conservative victory ""more, not less, likely"".It was Mr Brown's first direct challenge from a cabinet minister - but it would not topple the Labour leader as senior members of government refused to follow Mr Purnell's lead.Mr Brown was safe for the time being. But several months later, in January 2010, a fresh leadership challenge was mounted by two senior former Labour cabinet ministers.Geoff Hoon and Patricia Hewitt wrote to all Labour MPs, saying the party was ""deeply divided"" over Mr Brown's leadership and that the best way to resolve the issue was by way of secret ballot.They insisted it was not an ""attempted coup"" but a necessary step to resolve divisions within the party.But the duo could only muster the public support of a handful of backbenchers long-opposed to Mr Brown, with the majority of the party's MPs less than impressed by the move, which came just weeks before the general election.As the day wore on, a succession of cabinet ministers came out to back the PM, suggesting there was little momentum behind the plot - although it was noted that several were not exactly gushing in their support of Mr Brown.As history tells us, neither leadership challenge bore fruit but they reflected the internal doubts and divisions over Mr Brown at the helm.As leadership toppling attempts go, this one in 2014 was regarded as a particularly ""botched"" and ""shambolic coup"". Indeed, former Lib Dem leader Lord (Paddy) Ashdown described the move as a ""plot of deep malice"".Its instigator, Lord (Matthew) Oakeshott - a close ally of the-then Business Secretary Vince Cable - tried to unseat Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg.The peer was found to have commissioned secret polls suggesting the party would do better at the 2015 general election without Mr Clegg in the driving seat.The man Lord Oakeshott had long had in mind to take Mr Clegg's place - Mr Cable, who was on government business in China at the time - was forced to publicly condemn his friend's actions and state his backing for Mr Clegg.But Lord Oakeshott said the business secretary had in fact known about his polls and their findings.Nevertheless, the peer - who was denounced by the Lib Dem leadership for spending money that could have been spent on campaigning - quit the party, and issued a warning shot on his way out about the Lib Dems' future prospects.Mr Cable largely emerged unscathed but he faced questions about his loyalty to the leader. Although the two sought to put paid to reports of a rift with a (painfully awkward, 'nothing to see here, folks') stage-managed pint in a pub.Although the revolt failed, and Mr Clegg remained at the helm, the Lib Dems did go on to suffer a trouncing at the general election, losing nearly 50 of its MPs - one of them, Mr Cable himself - prompting his leader to quit.The Conservatives have a reputation for being more ruthless than their party rivals when it comes to getting rid of leaders they sense are no longer effectual.But, in 1995, Prime Minister John Major - tired of persistent rumours of a leadership challenge - decided to take the bull by the horns and trigger a surprise leadership election to silence his detractors.His own backbenchers had questioned Mr Major's ability to unite and lead the party, which was deeply divided over Europe.So ""put up or shut up"", he told them as he tendered his resignation as Conservative Party leader but not prime minister.But then stepped forward eurosceptic MP John Redwood, who resigned from the cabinet in order to contest Mr Major's leadership.This was unexpected by many, as the PM had said there had been assurances from his cabinet that none would stand against him.But Mr Major went on to win the ensuing election with a comfortable defeat over his challenger, who was not included in the PM's consequent cabinet reshuffle.No further contested leadership election took place until after the Conservatives' defeat at the 1997 general election, paving the way for William Hague to take over the running of the party.Not all attempts to oust a party leader end in failure: as Margaret Thatcher found out to her peril.With three electoral victories under her belt, the Conservative prime minister's downfall would come at the hands of her own party - not the voters.It was on 1 November 1990 when Geoffrey (now Lord) Howe - one of Mrs Thatcher's longest-serving ministers - resigned over differences with the party leader over Europe.In his now infamous speech on the floor of the House of Commons, he attacked the PM's policies and leadership style, comparing being one of her cabinet ministers to opening the batting at cricket only to find his bat had been ""broken... by the team captain"".It sparked the beginning of the end of the 11-year Thatcher reign.Michael (now Lord) Heseltine seized on the opportunity to challenge the prime minister in the ensuing leadership contest, from which she would eventually withdraw and John Major emerge as her successor. Reflecting on the revolt and its implications on the Conservative Party, Baroness Thatcher's biographer Charles Moore wrote: ""Because the coup was unjustified, and so trust broke down, the politics of the next 15 years were those of civil war."""
2015-05-15,Election swings and roundabouts,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-32741924,"If election manifesto claims are all about smoke and mirrors, should we now add swings and roundabouts to the political metaphor?There's an intriguing aspect to the general election results in the Midlands that puzzled me.It's the striking contrast in the swings between Labour and the Conservatives.David Cameron and his campaign strategists knew they were home and dry when Nuneaton was the first Midlands marginal to declare.It was not only a Tory hold but a swing to the Conservatives from Labour of 3%.I was in the Nottingham suburb of Beeston awaiting the result of the Broxtowe count. Would its high profile Conservative MP Anna Soubry survive a red surge?Nuneaton set the pattern. Across the Midlands, both east and west, there was a uniform swing of between three and four per cent to the Tories - Warwickshire North 3%, Amber Valley 4%, Derbyshire South 4% and Sherwood 4%. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan topped the Tory swingometer in the Midlands marginals with 5% in Loughborough.Yet in the big cities, it was a very different story. The swing went to Labour.So in Nottingham East they enjoyed a 6% swing, Nottingham South 5.8%, Leicester South 7.3%, Leicester West 5%, Birmingham Hall Green 12%, Birmingham Hodge Hill 8%.If swings to Labour on this scale had gone beyond the city ring road roundabouts and into the suburbs, Ed Miliband would have become prime minister by now.In confidence, one senior Labour insider in Nottingham told me its success in the city wards was down to organisation, experience and its teams of activists.""We won the ground war. If Nottingham's city boundaries were extended into Sherwood and Broxtowe, we would have won those constituencies as well,"" he told me.Labour leadership candidate, Leicester West's Liz Kendall has identified her party's problem beyond the ring road roundabout.It's about reaching out to Middle England.""We need to show people that we understand their aspirations and ambitions for the future,"" she told the Sunday Times.The problem for Labour was that Middle England was not interested in what the party offered…and still isn't. The Cameron brand worked its magic in those Midlands marginals... it'll take something or someone special to break up that ballot box relationship."
2015-05-15,Royal 'lobbying',https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32740154,"Prince Charles sent 27 letters to then Prime Minister Tony Blair and members of his government between September 2004 and March 2005, ""despite the Freedom of Information Act!"" as the prince joked in one.But did his suggestions and concerns have any bearing on the behaviour of Mr Blair's government?The request: Prince Charles expresses his worries over an EU directive on complementary medicines ""which is… effectively outlawing the use of certain herbal extracts"".  Mr Blair replied, offering moral support and practical help. He agreed that ""the implementation as it is currently planned is crazy"" and set out an action plan that included delaying implementation for all existing products to 2011. What happened: Herbal products were not required to be authorised until 2011, just as Mr Blair had promised. Prince Charles continues to sell his own brand of complementary products, Duchy Herbals, through Boots and Waitrose. The request: Writing to Mr Blair, the prince expresses a ""growing sense of anxiety"" that the Hill Farming Allowance, which supports farmers working on Britain's uplands, could be scrapped. In his reply, the prime minister said he understood that the Hill Farm Allowance would continue until 2007. What happened: The allowance lasted until the end of Labour's tenure in 2010, when it was abolished.The request: Just 18 months after the US-led invasion of Iraq, Prince Charles raised the issue of poor performance of Lynx helicopters in high temperatures, saying: ""I fear that this is just one more example of where our Armed Forces are being asked to do an extremely challenging job (particularly in Iraq) without the necessary resources.""Mr Blair replied: ""On the subject of the Lynx helicopter, the limitations of the existing platform, particularly in the extremely challenging environment within Iraq, are well recognised by the Ministry of Defence."" He added that replacement of the helicopters would be a priority. What happened: Mr Blair's comments go much further than what he was saying about the subject at the time. In the event, though, the fleet was not fully upgraded until 2011.The request: Prince Charles lamented that the government's TB prevention plans might not ""include a commitment to deal with the badger problem in the immediate future"" and pushed strongly for a cull, saying: ""All I can say is that I do urge you to look again at introducing a proper cull of badgers where it is necessary.""Mr Blair sympathised, saying he could ""personally see the case for culling badgers"". However, he was unwilling to commit to a cull.  What happened: Culling trials were conducted from 1998-2005. The final results, published in 2008, said that the badger cull could ""make no meaningful contribution"" to curbing bovine TB. It wasn't until 2013 that a full culling programme began in two pilot areas. These ended with the conclusion that the pilots had been neither humane nor effective at curbing the spread of TB.The request: Then Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell wrote to Prince Charles to say she had decided to give parts of the historic Smithfield meat market Grade II listed status, and was trying to persuade deputy prime minister John Prescott to ""call in"" the planning application to prevent demolition of other parts of the site. She had been swayed by evidence provided by Sir Neil Cossons, who was English Heritage chair at the time, after he had been asked by the prince to add his support. Prince Charles replied that he was ""extremely glad to read of your appreciation of the value of this group of buildings"". According to the Guardian, market workers desperate to see the redevelopment of the site invited the prince to meet them to discuss it, but his office said he was ""unlikely to accept as he did not want to interfere in the planning process"".What happened: Smithfield market is still the subject of planning battles a decade on. Successive planning applications have been refused by ministers. Last year then Communities Secretary Eric Pickles rejected plans for an office development on the site, stating that ""the extent of damage that the application would cause to the important heritage assets at Smithfield runs entirely counter to national and policy objectives intended to protect such assets from harm"".In March, the Museum of London announced a move from its current Barbican site to the Smithfield market building."
2015-05-15,Election fallout,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32703139,"""Some of those gimmicks - that tombstone, whatever idiot thought that up I do not know!""I was talking to the former Mayor of Crawley in Sussex, John Mortimer, in the town's Labour Supporters Club about the vexed question of what went wrong, and where Labour should go next. This seat is one of those southern seats Labour hoped to take, but failed.I hear a whole range of views in the club.""They didn't give nothing to depend on, they should be clear, and a little bit more down to Earth."" ""Good party, wrong leader, they don't look after business enough.""Councillor John Stanley tells me: ""I think in a way we did go too left, but now we can go a bit centre-left, or centre, depending who the new leader is.""The former mayor sums up the mood on the doorstep: ""Whatever we told them, they didn't believe us.""  Expect to hear all those views, and more, in the coming leadership contest. Step back from the angst of supporters, and it may not be that hard to see why Labour failed.  An economic recovery, hailed by independent organisations as the result of government policy, undid a party that had loudly proclaimed for five years that the coalition's policies would lead to economic disaster. Combine that with an uncharismatic and uninspirational leader, then you might argue no further debate is necessary.Fat chance of that. Defeat breeds resentment, and this one has opened up old divisions.  A chorus of Blairties, led by the man himself, has declared that Ed's problem was ignoring those with aspiration and ambition, failing to appeal to those running business. Incidentally, I've been ticked off by the perspicacious editor of the New Statesman, Jason Cowley, for using the ""unhelpful"" term ""Blairites"".I can't think of another description that fits Tony, Lord Mandelson, Lord Adonis and David Miliband quite so well. But call them what you will, the message was clear - Ed was too left wing, Labour should move back to the centre, or, if you like, to the right.Reading Mr Blair's pithy analysis, listening to Lord Mandelson's gripping and savage eloquence, describing a party sent out to shout: ""We love the poor and hate the rich,"" and so ignoring the middle, and you realise strong emotions are in play.But back to the future may not be sufficient. Of course elections are won on the centre ground. But grandees grinding axes, affronted by the failure of boys who used to make their tea, may be creating so much noise that they can't hear more insistent sounds.  For there are several elephants trumpeting loudly as they cram into the small space of the shadow cabinet room. Imagine these beasts are as gaily decorated as Berlin buddy bears. One is decked out in red, another in imperial purple bunting, and another, a mammoth, strong tusked and ice rimmed, painted yellow with tartan trimmings.Take the last first. The Scottish wipeout is Labour's biggest problem. Fail to solve it, and Labour can forget ever having a comfortable majority again. It is hard to argue Labour were wiped out in Scotland because the SNP outflanked them to the right with their appeal to the business community and the ambitious and aspirational. But it is true the SNP drew in to people from left, right and centre, just as the modernisers say Labour should. It was the politics of economic self-interest, but cast in a very different light. Tribally sneering at ""the reactionary ideology of nationalism"" as Mr Blair does, will not reach the central belt of Scotland, the middle ground of  Midlothian.What about that purple pachyderm?  In Crawley - in fact in seat after seat - there is a similar pattern.  Labour did, in fact, often increase the size of their vote. So did the Conservatives, usually by a bit more. But the real dynamic was the total collapse of the Lib Dems and the dramatic rise of UKIP. The increase in votes for Nigel Farage's party wasn't translated into parliamentary seats, but, although it is early days in terms of research, it probably hurt Labour a lot. If we believe - and I do - Matthew Goodwin and Rob Ford, authors of Revolt on the Right, these voters are often former Labour supporters - older, less educated, those left behind on the tides of  globalisation, stranded on the shores of post-industrialisation. They may have had too many disappointments to feel much ambition or aspiration. They are a challenge for Labour, and any new leader will spend a good deal of time thinking how to deal with the concerns of Europe and immigration.Whether to share their fears, or confront them will be a big decision.Which brings us to Red Nellie. Those members who still proudly call themselves socialist. This is not about Old Labour - they are more likely to be baristas or barristers than boilermakers. It is easy as an outsider, as a journalist, to treat politics as an intellectual game about how best to win power - but many people, particularly the foot soldiers, particularly after the death of  purely tribal loyalties, are in it because they passionately believe in winning  power to do something specific.Many of them are suspicious of the later incarnations of New Labour, not because it reached an accommodation with wealth and business, but because it seemed to worship at the same altar, to regard the party's core beliefs in redistribution and equality as childish fantasies from a past age.Perhaps to Mr Blair, they are the problem, people who may equate ""ambition"" with greed. They might point out that a man who claims to be worth ""only"" £20m may find it harder than most to squeeze through the eye of a needle to understand their point of view. Most successful Labour leaders will confront the left at some point, but the concerns of this group go to the existential question ""What is the party for?""This is not a polemic - not an argument about what should be done, but a reflection on the complex conundrums that will face any new Labour leader, the tearing apart of the old alliance that made up a Labour majority, and so the political need to satisfy groups with very different, indeed, contradictory demands. But looking for a Social Democratic universal theory of everything may be missing the point. What the party desperately wants is a leader who can pull the disparate threads together and articulate them as common purpose. Whether she or he exists is another matter.Much more on that in the coming months."
2015-05-15,'Take us with you',https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-32736153,"Thousands of people in the north of England have been using the hashtag ""take us with you Scotland"" to express their upset about the result of last week's general election, and Scottish nationalists are welcoming this English minority with open arms. Last Thursday's general election was a rough one for the Labour Party in its traditional stronghold in the north of England. But further to the north, the left-leaning Scottish National Party won nearly every seat it contested. That political contrast has made some left-wing voters in places like Manchester, Leeds and Sheffield look fondly on their neighbours. Since last Thursday's election in Britain the phrase ""take us with you Scotland"" has been used more than 24,000 times. ""Genuinely beginning to wonder if the North of England becoming a part of Scotland would be better for us, I really am,"" tweeted Aaron Miller from Yorkshire. Some cracked jokes under the tag after the North West Motorway Police account, which gives traffic updates, announced that they had ""picked up a pedestrian on the M62 who was trying to walk to Scotland.""After an initial spike of jokes over the weekend, the hashtag really took off when users start to mobilise in support of around a year-old petition on the campaigning site Change.org. The petition calls for the north of England to secede from the rest of the country and join up with Scotland, and more than 12,000 people have signed it.Its creator, a Sheffield resident who calls himself ""Stu Dent"", set it up to coincide with last year's Scottish independence referendum, and he also created a map imagining the boundary of a ""Scotland plus the north"" country.Stu Dent runs the Twitter account Hunters Bar, named after an area of southwest Sheffield which is very popular with - you guessed it - students. Despite the account having thousands of followers on Twitter, when the map was first posted last year, the image was shared only about 100 times - however, in the past week it's been retweeted by thousands. Stu Dent told BBC Trending that he was surprised at how popular his idea has become. ""In hindsight, perhaps I shouldn't have been,"" he said. ""There is a huge frustration in parts of the UK about the things that have happened since 2010.""""I think people need a place to go where they can say 'not in my name! This is not the England I want',"" he added. But in addition to disappointment from some quarters about the election result, there might be another reason why the petition is getting a boost now: the power of the Scottish Nationalists on Twitter. What started as a post-election joke in the North of England was quickly embraced by the so-called ""Cyber Nats"" - and a trend was born.The SNP's social media strategist Ross Colquhoun expressed the party's mood about the hashtag best, in a post which was shared more than 500 times. ""2014: #LetsStayTogether 2015: #TakeUsWithYouScotland What a difference a year makes"" he tweeted.Blog by Hannah HendersonNext story: The sport reporter and the obscene ranter who lost his jobFollow BBC Trending on Twitter @BBCtrending, and find us on Facebook."
2015-05-15,What Britain wants from Europe,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32695399,"David Cameron says he has a mandate to pursue EU reform following the Conservatives' general election victory. The PM, who will be hoping his majority government will give him extra leverage in Brussels, wants to renegotiate the terms of the UK's membership ahead of a referendum by the end of 2017. He has said he will campaign for Britain to remain in the EU if he gets the reforms he wants.Mr Cameron has said he does not want to reveal full details of his negotiating hand but he has given a broad indication, in a series of speeches and newspaper articles, of his priorities when he goes into talks with other EU leaders.These are: The prime minister has said Britain would resist any move towards a European Army and that he wants to free British police forces from EU interference. He has also ruled out Britain joining the euro.But he has placed less emphasis in recent years on demanding changes to EU social policy, such as the maximum 48-hour working week, agency workers, maternity leave and non-discrimination rules.The official UK government position is that a referendum will be held by the end of 2017 but Downing Street sources have said: ""If we can do it earlier we will.""There is speculation David Cameron is planning to hold the vote in 2016 to avoid a clash with French and German elections in 2017.The prime minister wants treaty change but even if the referendum was held in 2017 there may not be enough time to legally incorporate any reforms into a treaty and it would have to be done at a later stage.An early referendum would anger Eurosceptics who believe it would not allow enough time to make the case for exit or negotiate any meaningful concessions.""A rushed process would severely undermine the chances to secure a significant deal that both British business and voters could support and would waste the opportunity of a lifetime,"" Matthew Elliott, chief executive of Business for Britain told Breitbart London.The question is always crucial in any referendum and there is already a debate about what it should be. The Draft European Union (Referendum) Bill, published by the Conservatives in 2013, proposed this form of words: ""Do you think that the United Kingdom should remain a member of the European Union?""Some thought that leaned too far towards the status quo, encouraging a yes vote, and the Electoral Commission said it was not clear and direct enough. The watchdog proposed this form of words instead: ""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union?""The new Conservative government will attempt to repeal the Human Rights Act, which requires UK courts to treat the European Court of Human Rights as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. The European Court of Human Rights is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe (CoE), which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine.The freedom for people to move around Europe, enshrined in the EU treaties, works in parallel with the other three basic freedoms in the single market: freedom of goods, capital and services.It is likely to be a ""red line"" for other EU leaders, who do not want to see it eroded.Mr Cameron has steered clear of tackling it directly - for example by asking for an emergency ""brake"" on free movement, or a cap on numbers - focusing instead on reducing the incentive provided by welfare payments. In a speech last November, David Cameron set out measures to reduce the number of EU nationals moving to the UK.His main proposals were:Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission, has said he is ready to work with Mr Cameron to ""strike a fair deal for the United Kingdom in the EU"". The leaders of other EU nations have previously warned they are unlikely to support major changes to EU treaties to accommodate British demands. But Mr Cameron's general election victory may have given him extra leverage. ""The ball is very much in the court of the UK now,"" a senior EU official told The Guardian. ""It's up to the British to define what they want."" The key figure will be German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is very keen to keep Britain in the EU but has so far been unwilling to make major concessions to enable that to happen. There are fears that a ""pick and mix"" approach to EU treaties would undermine EU cohesion.Mr Cameron has said there is ""no doubt"" his planned reforms will require changes to the treaties governing the European Union. But this would require the unanimous support of all EU members, and may not be possible within the deadline he has set of a referendum before the end of 2017. Any attempt to change EU laws on free movement would meet fierce resistance from some EU nations, particularly Eastern European states. Mr Juncker has said free movement is non-negotiable.Mr Cameron may find it difficult to get unanimous support for his proposals for a four-year waiting period for migrant workers claiming UK benefits. East European EU members would be likely to oppose this, on the grounds that it would discriminate against their citizens.  Attempts to secure opt-outs for the City are unlikely to go down well with other European leaders.However, there are precedents for EU treaty changes to accommodate some countries' specific concerns - for example, the protocol attached to the Lisbon Treaty for Ireland.Mr Cameron has faced repeated calls to say whether he would campaign for Britain's exit from the EU in the referendum if he fails to get what he wants from the renegotiation process. All he has said is that he will ""rule nothing out"". Some Conservative MPs want Britain to leave the EU no matter what David Cameron manages to renegotiate. A larger group are likely to want more concessions than Mr Cameron has so far indicated he is prepared to demand.Senior backbencher David Davis, who was defeated by Mr Cameron for the Tory leadership in 2005, told the Daily Telegraph the majority of the 332 Conservative MPs want Mr Cameron to negotiate an ""opt-out"" power to stop individual EU laws from applying to Britain. The prime minister has said this would be ""impossible"" without Britain leaving the EU.Mr Davis claims as many as 60 Tory MPs would be prepared to rebel and vote for Britain's exit from the EU if the prime minister fails to deliver.Graham Brady, chairman of the Tory backbench 1922 committee, which represents backbenchers, has urged David Cameron to give all Conservative MPs, including ministers, a free vote in the EU referendum.In January, Mr Cameron warned that serving cabinet ministers would have to quit the government if they wanted to campaign to leave the EU if he had secured the reforms to it he wants.In the 1975 referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Economic Community, as the EU was then called, Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson decided to suspend collective responsibility because his cabinet was split on the issue. Ministers were allowed to vote with their consciences and campaign against each other. The majority of them, including Mr Wilson, joined the Yes camp, but left-wingers, such as Tony Benn, played a leading role in the No campaign. The Yes campaign won easily with 67% of the vote."

Mr Murphy said he would tender his resignation alongside a plan to reform the party.He lost his seat in last week's general election as the SNP won 56 of the 59 Scottish seats, leaving Labour with a single MP in Scotland.Mr Murphy said he wanted to have a successor as leader in place by the summer, and confirmed he would not be standing for a seat at the Scottish Parliament in next year's election. Instead, he said it was time to ""do something else"" and that he believed the party would continue to be divided if he remained as leader. His deputy, Kezia Dugdale MSP, will become acting leader until a permanent successor is found. Mr Murphy had faced calls to resign from several MSPs, trade unions and former MPs in the wake of his party's near wipeout at the general election.He insisted he had decided to stand down ahead of the national executive voting by 17-14 in favour of him staying in the job.Speaking at a media conference after the national executive meeting, he said: ""It is clear that a small minority who didn't accept my election as leader of the Scottish Labour Party just five months ago won't accept the vote of the executive today and that will continue to divide the party.""Today I received more support in the executive vote than I did from members of the executive when I stood for election five months ago.""He said it would be up to the executive whether to accept the reforms he would be proposing before he left the post. But he warned: ""A party in such urgent need of reform blocks those changes at its peril.""The former East Renfrewshire MP said Labour had been crushed between ""two nationalisms"" in Scotland and England.Mr Murphy said he left no legacy of bitterness for anyone in the Labour Party, and the only person he was angry at was the person who blamed Scottish Labour for the party's UK-wide general election defeat - a reference to Unite leader Len McCluskey.And he said that in many ways Scottish Labour was the ""least modernised part of the Labour movement"" and that he wanted his successor to be elected under a one member, one vote system.Mr Murphy added: ""The Labour Party's problem is not the link with trade unions, or even the relationship with Unite members - far from it. It is the destructive behaviour of one high profile trade unionist.""The leader of the Scottish Labour Party doesn't serve at the grace of Len McCluskey, and the next leader of the UK Labour Party should not be picked by Len McCluskey.""Mr McCluskey has been a vocal critic of Mr Murphy's leadership and opposed his appointment in December when Mr Murphy won the contest to replace Johann Lamont.Jim Murphy laughed and joked with Scottish Labour's sole MP as he made his way down the hotel corridor to announce his resignation.He certainly brought energy and dynamism to his election campaign - but all that achieved was Ian Murray in Edinburgh South.So as Mr Murphy bows out, who could replace him?The deputy leader Kezia Dugdale may want to step up or Neil Findlay could try again after challenging last time. Maybe the party's finance spokeswoman Jackie Baillie thinks her steady hand could steer the ship.Jenny Marra is also often talked about as future face of the party.Whoever steps into Jim Murphy's red shoes he or she will have to face a difficult 2016 Holyrood election, to put it mildly.There are also more fundamental questions about how the party can possibly move on as it faces a surging SNP.Mr Murphy was very much a creature of ""New Labour"" - but to today's generation that's old Labour.Party members may start looking for someone with no links to the past, neither a Brownite nor a Blairite. A 'cleanskin' - as the politicos put it - may well help re-connect with voters.That's a long way from now though - even some of the party's opponents may view this latest train wreck with a modicum of sympathy. Ms Lamont had resigned after claiming Scottish Labour was treated like a ""branch office"" by the London-based party leadership.Mr Murphy concluded his speech by saying: ""Scotland needs a strong Labour party; Scotland needs a united Labour party. We have been the greatest force for change in our nation's remarkable history. ""The Scottish Labour party will rise again. It will be under someone else's leadership and I am confident about my party's future.""Harriet Harman MP, acting leader of the UK Labour Party, said it would be for Scottish Labour to choose a new leader. She added: ""As a cabinet minister and leader of his party in Scotland, Jim has been a hugely important figure in the Labour Party. He leaves with the best wishes and thanks of our movement.""Labour peer Lord McConnell, a former Scottish first minister, said the party's problems were ""much deeper than one individual and one affiliate"".He said: ""We have a disconnect locally and nationally with wider Scottish society. ""We have a problem with our political positioning in the post devolution age where the party particularly at the UK level has never been comfortable with success in the Scottish parliament and has always tried to see things through a UK prism rather than a Scottish prism.""We need to find a new generation, a new leader, new generation, new ideas, a fresh approach.""In a tweet, Scottish first minister and SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said: ""I wish Jim Murphy all the very best for the future. Leadership is not easy and he deserves credit for standing up for what he believes in.""Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson also reacted on Twitter, saying: ""Jim Murphy announces a managed exit in order to help the party, which is to his credit. But leaves a tough gig for whoever comes next.""The meeting of Scottish Labour's executive was disrupted by protesters who entered the party's headquarters.Police were called and the protesters, who included persistent anti-austerity activists Sean Clerkin and Piers Doughty-Brown, left the building to protest further from the street outside.The protesters were calling for Mr Murphy to remain as leader to ""finish the job of destroying Scottish Labour"".A Police Scotland spokeswoman said officers had been called and found two protestors on the third floor of the building. She added: ""Both left on police arrival. Advice and assistance was given."""
2015-05-16,Labour contenders clash on spending,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32761561,"Prospective Labour leaders have clashed over Labour's record in government in their first public debate in the race to succeed Ed Miliband.Former cabinet ministers including Yvette Cooper and Andy Burnham defended Labour's fiscal record and spending on schools and hospitals.However, candidates from the 2010 intake of MPs argued that the party spent too much while in office.The debate followed Chuka Umunna's withdrawal from the leadership contest.The remaining candidates appeared at the annual conference of the Progress think tank in London.There was agreement that Labour needed to demonstrate economic credibility to regain power, with shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt telling the meeting that the party needed to be ""trusted with public finances and the family finances"".Mr Hunt, who was first elected to Parliament in 2010 when Labour lost power, argued the last Labour government ""spent too much"" and failed to ""leave enough economic headroom to deal with the economic crisis and the recession"".Shadow health minister Liz Kendall said: ""There's absolutely nothing progressive about spending more on debt interest payments than on educating our children.""But shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: ""The Tories have had a triumph of spin over the facts in saying what they said about the economic record of the last Labour government.""The former chief secretary to the Treasury said the deficit did ""grow too large"" in the government's later years but insisted: ""The last Labour government ran more surpluses in its first term than the Tories did in 18 years.""Yvette Cooper, another former chief secretary to the Treasury, said: ""We should never let anybody tell us that it was too many teachers, doctors or nurses that caused Lehman Brothers bank in New York to crash.""Shadow international development secretary Mary Creagh said: ""People have forgotten the economic credibility that the last Labour government had.""She said Labour had built schools and hospitals that were ""treasured in our communities"".Ms Cooper, Mr Burnham, Ms Kendall and Ms Creagh have declared their intention to run for leader, while Mr Hunt told the conference he would make an announcement next week.At the same event, shadow energy secretary Caroline Flint announced she would be running for deputy leader.The Don Valley MP told the Today programme ahead of the debate that Labour lost the election because ""fundamentally the public did not trust us on the economy"".Exeter MP Ben Bradshaw has already announced a bid to be deputy, saying Labour ""must and could win the next election"", but only if it ""broadens its appeal by adopting sensible, centre-left politics which celebrate wealth creation and entrepreneurship"".Former Labour campaign co-ordinator Tom Watson is reported to be crowd-funding a deputy leadership bid, while Walthamstow MP Stella Creasy has said she is ""open to the question"" of running.Barnsley East MP and shadow transport secretary Michael Dugher - a fierce critic of Ed Miliband's election campaign - is to run Mr Burnham's campaign, according to the website LabourList.It is reported that Mr Burnham also has the backing of Labour peer Lord Falconer, who was lord chancellor and justice secretary under Tony Blair and was close to the former PM.Shadow culture secretary Chris Bryant has signalled his backing for Ms Cooper, tweeting that the next leader must be ""someone who's been tried in the fiery furnace of public opinion"".Mr Hunt said on Friday he would be be attending the debate - along with the other four hopefuls - to ""set out my analysis on how we begin to understand what went so wrong and why"".He added: ""We must use this leadership election to ask some very profound questions.""All voices in the party must be heard so that we can have a full and proper assessment as to why the politics of nationalism triumphed in Scotland and huge swathes of England, and how we have allowed the Conservative Party to present a more compelling vision for Britain to so many millions of people.""Speculation still surrounds shadow business secretary Mr Umunna's decision to pull out on Friday, when he said he was not ""comfortable"" with the ""pressure"" of being a candidate.As well as citing extensive pressure and scrutiny Mr Umunna also said he was ruling himself out because of concerns about the impact of the bid on his family.A rising star of the party, Mr Umunna was first elected to Parliament in 2010 - alongside Tristram Hunt and Liz Kendall - before joining the shadow cabinet.Asked about the candidate who might win, Conservative Chancellor George Osborne said: ""The Labour leadership contest has descended into farce.""But it's not actually about personalities. I don't think the Labour Party any more represents the working people of this country who aspire to a better life."""

I'm not suggesting he takes a break from being leader.""Clearly the national executive has the authority, they're the ruling body. ""I'm told that they made a decision. I'm told it was a procedurally correct decision, he is the leader but I think it's important that as leader he takes a break and I think it's important that we work out how these complex questions are answered by a team.""No one person has all the answers. I'm particularly concerned about tone, making sure we get a tone that ensures that the 27 million people who didn't vote for UKIP last week may be persuaded to vote for us in future.""The party has been beset by wrangling since Mr Farage agreed to stay on as leader, days after standing down after failing to get elected in Thanet South.He had pledged before the general election that he would quit the post if he failed to get elected to Parliament.Senior aide Matthew Richardson has left the party, following claims from MEP Patrick O'Flynn that Mr Farage had fallen under the influence of ""inexperienced"" advisers.UKIP has also confirmed the departure of Mr Farage's chief of staff Raheem Kassam.Mr Farage ruled out quitting as leader on BBC's Question Time on Thursday, saying he had ""phenomenal"" support, and has challenged his critics to decide whether they want to stay in the party.In his article, Mr Carswell had said that ""knowing how difficult it is to lead a party makes me admire Nigel Farage all the more"".""I know that I never could,"" he added, stressing that he would find it ""impossible to simultaneously lead UKIP, be the voice of the party in the Commons, represent my Clacton constituents and at the same time be a husband and a dad"".However, he said that ""even leaders need to take a break"", adding: ""Nigel needs to take a break now.""UKIP got nearly four million votes at the election, but returned only one MP - former Conservative Mr Carswell in the Clacton constituency."

Under the plans, ministers could force schools rated as ""requiring improvement"" and missing new government benchmarks to become an academy.Coasting schools have average results which have often flatlined over time.Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, Mrs Morgan said faster action was needed.She said: ""Our big priorities will be to speed up the process for tackling failing schools; extend our academies programme to tackle 'coasting' schools; and deliver on our commitment to open new free schools.""The proposals will be in a new bill due to be introduced in the Queen's Speech. ""First, we will take new powers to step in from the moment that a school is found to be failing,"" Mrs Morgan said.""From day one, regional schools commissioners will be able to bring in new leadership and support from other excellent schools and heads, and we will speed up the process of turning schools into academies to make sure that new expert leadership is found for all schools that need it as quickly as possible.""She said that coasting schools will be put on an immediate notice to improve and could then be taken over and turned into an academy.They will be required to work with a team of ""expert"" head teachers.She said: ""Those that aren't able to demonstrate a clear plan for improvement will be given new leadership - we know this works in turning schools around.""More than 3,300 schools in England are labelled ""requires improvement"", but the plans are unlikely to cover that many schools.Under the current system, secondary schools are considered to be failing, and therefore eligible for intervention, if fewer than 40% of their students score at least five Cs at GCSE, including English and maths, and they do not meet national averages in pupil progress.In primary schools, the threshold for intervention is if fewer than 65% of pupils get Level 4 in reading, writing and maths and a below average number of pupils make the expected amount of progress.It is not yet clear how coasting schools will be deemed in need of intervention.It is understood that a new category will be devised covering schools which are rated as ""requires improvement"" and which fail to meet a new set of standards on improvement."
2015-05-16,Co-op Group to keep political funding,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-32762858,"The Co-operative Group has decided to continue financially supporting the Co-operative Party, which has strong ties to Labour.Members of the group, the UK's biggest mutual organisation, voted on the issue at their annual general meeting.They passed a motion by 48,579 for, to 39,479 against, to approve ""political expenditures"" of up to £1m which support the movement's objectives.Last year the Co-op Group gave £625,000 to the Co-op Party.This figure was down on the sums donated in previous years. The AGM also included a vote on new corporate governance procedures which would mean members having less of a direct say.The Co-operative Group is still recovering from a period of financial mismanagement and some members have recently expressed concerns about how elections to the board are chosen.The banking arm of the group came close to collapse in 2013, bringing the whole group to a £2.5bn annual loss that year. The Co-op Party includes among its members a number of Labour MPs, including shadow chancellor Chris Leslie and Walthamstow MP Stella Creasy. The politicians stand as candidates of both the Co-operative Party and the Labour Party, and the two political movements have strong historical ties. The board asked the members of the Co-operative Group whether they wanted to continue financially supporting the Co-operative Party, or any other party. Allan Leighton, chairman of the Co-op Group, said: ""There's a clear remit from the members to continue to support the Labour Party.""It allows us to now have a conversation with the Co-op Labour Party about what we do next.""There was also a members' motion on the agenda, put forward by those in favour of making political donations of up to £1m a year.The motion to approve political funding ""not to exceed £1m per annum"" was carried by 55.17% to 44.83%.BBC business correspondent Joe Lynam said: ""To meet a £1.5bn hole in its accounts - mostly stemming from its banking division - the Co-op Group has had to sell off parts of its businesses and hand over majority control of its bank to American hedge funds.""It's also in the process of radically changing the way it runs itself into a more corporate structure with less of a direct say by its members.""He said that ""in theory"", each of the 2.8 million Co-op members could vote on a series of motions about the reforms, as well as how its bosses are paid, and retaining the links to the Co-operative party.One of the group's largest independent societies, Midcounties, recently threatened legal action over a shortlist of six candidates for the group's board being reduced to three - the number of positions available - before a member vote.

2015-05-16,Osborne plans July 'stability' Budget,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32761566,"Chancellor George Osborne has said that he will deliver a new Budget on 8 July.He claimed it would have ""a laser-like focus"" on raising productivity and living standards.He said he was making the unusual move of having a second Budget in one year in order to ""deliver on the commitments we have made to working people"".Labour said the chancellor would have to set out ""who is going to pay"" for what it called ""uncosted promises"" in the election campaign.Speaking outside 11 Downing Street, the chancellor gave a broad outline of his plans for the forthcoming Budget but refused to be drawn on the details, including the Conservatives' planned £12bn of welfare cuts.""I don't want to wait to deliver on the commitments we have made to working people,"" he said.""It will continue with the balanced plan we have to deal with our debts, invest in our health service and reform welfare to make work pay.""But there will also be a laser-like focus on making our economy more productive so we raise living standards across our country.""We're going to put Britain into good shape for the long term.""The last Budget was held on 18 March and included tax cuts for first-time house buyers.Writing in the Sun, Mr Osborne admitted it was ""unusual"" to have two Budgets in the same year, but he wanted to turn ""promises made in the election into a reality"".Again, Mr Osborne did not specifically outline how the Conservatives plan to fulfil a pledge to cut £12bn in welfare spending but said he wants to make the welfare system ""fair for the people who pay for it"".He writes: ""We will protect the NHS and give it more funding each and every year, while making savings across Whitehall. ""We'll crack down hard on tax avoidance and aggressive tax planning by the rich - because everyone should pay their fair share.  ""We will always protect the most vulnerable, but we also need a welfare system that's fair to the people who pay for it. If you can work you should be working, so we'll take the next steps in our benefit reforms to make sure that happens.""Second, we've got to go on helping businesses create jobs in Britain, so we move towards full employment. That means facing a hard truth: in Britain we produce about a quarter less for every hour we work than countries like America or Germany. Fixing that long-running productivity weakness is the big challenge for the next five years.""So in the Budget we'll spend less on welfare, and instead invest to create three million more apprenticeships, so that young people can learn a trade, get better jobs and earn more.""After the Budget in March independent forecaster the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said that Mr Osborne needed to spell out exactly how he plans to cut £12bn from welfare spending.Of those £12bn planned cuts, £2bn were outlined ahead of the general election - all the cuts are supposed to be in place by 2017-18.Labour's shadow energy and climate change secretary, Caroline Flint, accused the Tories of making ""a number of uncosted promises"" during the election campaign.She told the BBC: ""It will be interesting to see who is going to pay for those uncosted policies when they bring the Budget in July."""

If it isn't, stop it and do something else.""He also criticised Mr Farage's comments about HIV patients during the TV leaders' debate last month.While debating about the NHS, Mr Farage said: ""You can come into Britain from anywhere in the world and get diagnosed with HIV and get the retro-viral drugs that cost up to £25,000 per year per patient.""Mr Carswell wrote: ""By all means we should highlight the problem of health tourism. But we need to admit that using the example of HIV patients to make the point was ill-advised.""He said the party needed to strike ""the right tone"" and added: ""UKIP has been at its most persuasive when we have been most optimistic.""Anger is never a great way to motivate people - at least not for very long.""The party has been beset by wrangling since Mr Farage agreed to stay on as leader, days after standing down after failing to get elected in Thanet South.He had pledged before the general election that he would quit the post if he failed to get elected to Parliament.Matthew Richardson has left the party, following claims from MEP Patrick O'Flynn that Mr Farage had fallen under the influence of ""inexperienced"" advisers.

They absolutely loved how he helped them and he was a highly-regarded local MP,"" Mr Bone said.""He stood up for what was right rather than what the party line was. In those days - the John Major years - it was much more difficult to stand up against the party machine. He had strong views on Europe.""Sir Peter started his career as an insurance broker, joining the Wycombe Young Conservatives in 1949 and the Oxford University Conservative Association in 1951.He went on to become a Conservative councillor on Buckinghamshire County Council between 1961 and 1967.Wellingborough mayor-elect Barry Graves also paid tribute to Sir Peter, remembering him as a ""very strong constituency MP"".""I remember going out and canvassing with him and he would go everywhere. He knew the area and the people. He was very much a man of the local constituency.""He was ""a very approachable man"", Mr Graves added.Sir Peter was knighted in 1994. "

The Smith proposals included giving Holyrood the power to set income tax rates and bands, as well as control over a share of VAT and some welfare benefits. But Ms Sturgeon's SNP also wants the Scottish Parliament to be given powers over business taxes, employment law, the minimum wage and additional powers over welfare.Speaking after meeting Ms Sturgeon, Mr Cameron told the BBC: ""Let's make sure Smith is implemented in full. I'm going to keep the commitment I made to the people of Scotland. Let's get that done first because it does create a really strong Scottish Parliament.""He added: ""Of course, if people want to make future proposals I'll look at them.""The prime minister again said he did not support full fiscal autonomy for Scotland - the responsibility for all areas of tax and spending except defence and foreign affairs - stating that it would mean £7bn of cuts or extra tax-raising.What Nicola Sturgeon is trying to say is she has a mandate. She has 56 out of the 59 MPs elected in Scotland and she won 50% of the vote - unprecedented here in Scotland.She says that gives her leverage to push David Cameron. David Cameron says he wants to keep the nation together.The language coming out of Westminster last week was very much a cordial one. 'We will listen'.Nicola Sturgeon has warned him that if he doesn't listen, then the people of Scotland will judge him accordingly.Ms  Sturgeon described the hour-long talks at her official residence at Bute House as ""constructive and business-like"". She said Mr Cameron had made a ""commitment"" that the Smith proposals would be implemented ""as agreed"".""But secondly the prime minister agreed that he would look at proposals that we would now send to suggest the areas we can go beyond Smith,"" Ms Sturgeon said.""There was no agreement in terms of the substance of that but we will submit those proposals, the prime minister has said they will consider them and there will be a meeting to look at how we take that further forward.""Referring to her party's success in last week's general election, which saw the SNP win 56 out of 59 Scottish seats, Ms Sturgeon said: ""People in Scotland have now voted fairly convincingly for the SNP and sent a message that we want the Smith Commission proposals to go further and be built on.""The ball is in his court but I'm going into this in good faith.""She added: ""David Cameron and I are a world apart politically but, where we can, I'm determined to do business in the interests of the people of Scotland and across the UK.""She said she would have a ""constructive and business-like"" relationship with the prime minister. The two leaders shook hands on the front steps of Bute House as Mr Cameron arrived. Mr Cameron left the building shortly before 11:00, almost an hour after he had arrived.The two sides agreed to hold more regular discussions in the future, possibly quarterly. "
2015-05-16,Umunna withdraws Labour leader bid,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32748106,"Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna has withdrawn from the Labour party leadership contest, just days after throwing his hat into the ring.The MP, 36, said in a statement that he was not comfortable with the level of pressure and scrutiny that came with being a leadership candidate.Mr Umunna also cited concerns about the impact of the bid on his family.BBC political editor Nick Robinson said the MP's team insisted no ""unwelcome press story"" lay behind the move.But Mr Umunna had been shocked by the level of scrutiny of himself, his mother, sister and girlfriend, he said.You can follow the latest reaction here.A rising star of the party, Mr Umunna was first elected to Parliament in 2010 before joining the shadow cabinet.He confirmed his candidacy for the Labour leadership via a post on his Facebook page on 12 May, saying the party under Ed Miliband had failed to appeal to enough voters in England.But on Friday he said he had not found the leadership bid to be ""a comfortable experience"".I understand that Chuka Umunna has told friends that ""this is not right for me or people close to me. I'm human, the rest of my life is more important to me than politics.""The shadow business secretary has been distressed by the degree of scrutiny he, his family and his girlfriend have come under since he declared his intention to stand for the labour leadership.I am told that this includes reporters waiting outside the houses of relatives late at night.Friends of Mr Umunna deny that he is nervous of not getting the support of enough MPs to run for the leadership; they point out that he already has half the necessary names and that there are some weeks to go.The shadow business secretary now wants to play a leading role in arguing that Britain should stay in the EU and does not rule out seeking the leadership in the future.He said he thought he had understood ""the scrutiny and attention a leadership contest would bring"", but added: ""However, since the night of our defeat last week I have been subject to the added level of pressure that comes with being a leadership candidate.""The shadow business secretary said he had wondered if it was too soon for him to stand for the leadership, and ""I fear it was."" He also cited concerns about the impact on ""the rest of one's life"" and those close to him.""Consequently, after further reflection, I am withdrawing my candidacy,"" he said.Mr Umunna said he would continue to serve as shadow business secretary and hoped to ""play a leading role"" in Labour's campaign to keep the UK in the EU during the forthcoming in/out referendum.Commenting on the news, Labour former culture secretary Ben Bradshaw - who is expected to run for deputy leader - said Mr Umunna was a ""terrible loss"" to the field.He told the BBC's Daily Politics the Streatham MP had been the candidate the Conservative Party ""feared the most"".""And if it's the result of pressure on an extended family or an extended group of friends, I think that's a very sad reflection on our political culture,"" he said.Chuka Umunna feels ""liberated"", he told me, by his decision to quit the Labour leadership race.He hopes to be given a good role (shadow chancellor, I wonder?) by whoever becomes Labour leader. And I expect he'll become very high profile in the campaign to keep Britain in Europe, which is increasingly looking like it will be next May.He'll endorse a candidate in the next four weeks before nominations close. It will be very interesting to see who he piles in behind.Read more from Allegra (see post 13.23).Former Labour leader Lord Kinnock said he thought Mr Umunna had made the right decision.He said: ""If he felt in his soul that he wasn't prepared to subject himself - and more importantly his family - to the kind of attention which is fairly typical, sadly, these days, he has done absolutely the right thing.""There is no point at all in inflicting avoidable, unnecessary misery on those you love most.""Leadership contender Mary Creagh said she had ""huge respect"" for Mr Umunna, telling BBC Radio 4's World at One programme it took ""courage"" to withdraw from the leadership race.Mr Umunna was ""a big beast"" and would play a ""big role"" in the future of the Labour Party, she added.Yvette Cooper, Andy Burnham, Liz Kendall and Mary Creagh have already thrown their hats into the ring for Labour's top job while a number of other potential candidates, including Dan Jarvis, Alan Johnson and David Lammy, have ruled themselves out. Candidates must secure nominations from 34 colleagues - 15% of the party's MPs - by 15 June to make it on to ballot papers, which will be sent to members in August ahead of the leader's election a month later."

However, Mr Justice Stuart Smith at Southwark Crown Court said there was a ""very strong likelihood"" a custodial sentence would follow.The jury heard how Mote submitted numerous false expenses claims for payment for work that organisations had allegedly carried out on his behalf.Mote claimed the money was to pay whistleblowers in cash through third parties. He also said he had been ""targeted for being an anti-EU MEP.""During his time an MEP he also made £250,000 legitimate expenses claims.No date has been set for the sentencing."

2015-05-16,Round-up: BBC experts' analysis,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/election-2015-32650417,"The political future of the United Kingdom has become clearer after the results of the general election emerged around the country.David Cameron says he hopes to govern for all of the UK after the Conservatives took 331 seats - enough to form a slender majority in the Commons.Labour has been all but wiped out by the SNP in Scotland and suffered a disappointing set of results elsewhere, while the Lib Dems are left with just eight MPs after many party heavyweights such as Vince Cable and Danny Alexander lost their seats.So with battles won and lost and the fall-out and celebrations beginning, BBC correspondents examine the implications and challenges that lie ahead for the new government - and for those whose political careers have been ended by voters.No pollster, no pundit, no political leader saw it coming - not even David Cameron himself.Governing parties don't gain seats. Parties that have implemented painful cuts and are promising more certainly don't. Until that is the Conservative Party did - achieving what had seemed to be Mission Impossible - a Tory majority.Until that is David Cameron's personal triumph which triggered the near simultaneous resignation of his three principle opponents - Messrs Miliband, Clegg and Farage.They did so in part because they helped to crush their partners in coalition these last five years - reducing the Liberal Democrat parliamentary party to a size when it can fit into two London taxis and still have two seats to spare.In part because the extraordinary tidal wave of support for the SNP swept dozens of once safe Labour seats away.In part because Nigel Farage persuaded millions to vote for him but secured just one seat - not, though, the one he was standing in.Read more from Nick Robinson hereThe question uppermost in the prime minister's mind as he assembles his new government is how to keep the kingdom united.""Above all I want to bring our country together,"" he revealed after the result, ""to reclaim a mantle we should never have lost - the mantle of one nation, one United Kingdom"".Looking at the political landscape from Land's End today is very different to the view from John O'Groats.A sea of Conservative and Unionist blue dominates the scene across much of England, while a field of SNP nationalist yellow stretches to the horizon and beyond from the north.David Cameron's greatest challenge is to prevent the union he supports being torn apart by mutual resentment - resentment from Scotland at a Westminster government dominated by English Tories, and resentment from England at the preferential treatment people think is being given to the Scots.Those who assumed the future of the Union had been safeguarded by the Scottish referendum must think again.Read more from Mark Easton hereOne thing is rock-solid true: the Conservatives who worked on this campaign are as surprised by the result as the pollsters, pundits, politicians and general population.Maybe they shouldn't be - the economy is in good shape and the Conservatives had incumbency advantage.But when I travelled back from the prime minister's last rally with a group of exhausted Conservative campaign officials it was clear that 290 seats was a hoped-for target.No-one talked about anything over 300 seats, and no-one even mentioned an overall majority.So what special sauce pushed David Cameron into No 10 with a Commons majority?Mr Cameron had two simple messages in the campaign and he rarely veered away from them; the first - the economy is in good shape and the recovery is threatened by Labour. And the second - the SNP would hold a Labour-led government to ransom.Read more from Jonny Dymond hereBrian Taylor, BBC political editor, ScotlandOf all the comments on the overnight apocalypse, undoubtedly the most straightforward came from a defeated Scottish Labour MP.Since there were quite a few of them, let me narrow the focus a little. Come on down, Tom Harris.Mr Harris had plainly anticipated defeat. Nonetheless, he looked suitably lugubrious as his fate was confirmed.Why, he was asked eagerly, had Labour lost? ""Because we did not win enough votes.""Psephologically, it is perfect. Complete in itself. Psychologically, it sums up Labour's gloom without descending into subsidiary matters such as leadership, strategy and the rest. As a forward-thinking strategy, it is ideal. Win more votes. Simple.Read more from Brian Taylor hereThis has been an election which may have more profound consequences than almost any in living memory.We now face a generational decision about our future in Europe, with an EU referendum in two years' time almost certain.There will also be serious questions about the future of the Union, following an SNP landslide that has turned Scotland into a virtual one-party state.David Cameron's victory also represents a colossal achievement.Only once before in recent history has an incumbent government increased its majority - and that was Mrs Thatcher in her prime in the 1980s.It is also a significant personal victory for Mr Cameron and a rebuff for those in his party who had become increasingly sceptical about his ability to win.But while it may represent a defeat for those Tories who saw this election as a potential opportunity to rid themselves of David Cameron, he must now govern with a wafer-thin majority.For the SNP, their stunning victory can only increase the pressure on Nicola Sturgeon to include a commitment to a second independence referendum in her party's manifesto for next year's Scottish elections.It is an election which has not just defied all the predictions of the pollsters and pundits - but which may yet prompt the most fundamental re-casting of British politics for a generation.Read more from Norman Smith hereAfter an extraordinary night, some brief conclusions:Read more from James Landale hereIs this the end of the union?That is the question many people will be asking this morning after the party which has fought for Scottish independence for 80 years swept to victory.The answer from the jubilant Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon is a firm ""No"".She insists that her MPs will speak for all of Scotland, not just for the 45% who voted for the country to leave the United Kingdom last September.In the closing hours of the most extraordinary election campaign which anyone in Scotland can remember, Ms Sturgeon turned to talk of ""legitimacy.""That will be her watchword in the coming days as she argues that the prime minister cannot ignore the democratic will of the Scottish people.Politically, Scotland and England this morning look and feel like very different countries.Read more from James Cook hereAfter weeks of chatter about an election too close to call, it wasn't that close at all.David Cameron will be continuing as our prime minister.So, what is all this likely to mean?A referendum on whether the UK stays in, or leaves, the European Union, within the next two-and-a-half years.A race to be the next leader of the Labour Party.A race to be the next leader of the Liberal Democrats.And a huge new presence of Scottish National Party MPs at Westminster.And so here's another thing we know for certain this morning: Politics ain't going to be boring any time soon.Read more from Chris Mason hereFor Labour the story of their terrible night is rapidly turning into the search for a new leader. So who will that be?Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, is almost certain to run.  Even before this election, both he and another almost inevitable candidate, Chuka Umunna, had raised eyebrows inside the party at the work they had put in, preparing the ground with members and the unions for potential bids.Yvette Cooper, before the election, was still thought not to have made up her mind over whether to run. That decision has been made perhaps a little easier as her husband, Ed Balls, has lost his seat.She is certainly potentially in the frame, along with two lesser known names - Liz Kendall and Dan Jarvis - two MPs who were only elected in 2010 for the first time. This could be their moment. But whoever is in the job, they face a monumental task.Read Laura Kuenssberg's Twitter hereSterling is up (the most for seven years against the euro), share prices are up (especially bank shares like Lloyds and RBS, and energy shares such as Centrica), government bond prices are up.To state the obvious, investors love the Tories' general election victory.There are a few reasons.One (no surprise here) is that Labour's threat of breaking up banks and imposing energy price caps has been lifted.Second is that investors have been discounting days and weeks of wrangling after polling day over who would form the government - and so they are semi-euphoric that we already know who's in charge.Third, many investors tend to be economically conservative and instinctively Conservative.But although the City may be a bit drunk on the result, its pleasure in Ed Miliband's and Ed Balls' humiliation may be making it a bit blind - perhaps dangerously so - to some bumps in the economic road ahead.Read more from Robert Peston hereNigel Farage dreamed of holding the balance of power, but in the end his UKIP party is now worse off than when it came into the election.At the seventh time of asking he was rejected - this time by the people of Thanet South. It was a similar story in Rochester and Strood where Mark Reckless, who sensationally defected from the Tories last year, was also sent packing.In seats on UKIP's target list, like Thurrock in Essex, the party failed to make gains. In Grimsby - where Mr Farage went twice in the last six weeks - they came third.UKIP got around four million votes - with especially strong showings in north-east and south-east England - but it's ended up with just one MP, and a vacancy at the top. This has led to UKIP attacking the current system of choosing MPs, which it's described as ""busted"" and ""dysfunctional"".In one sense, this campaign was a complete failure and it's left an aftermath of angry voters, and others wondering if the UKIP bubble has burst.Read Robin Brant's Twitter hereI monitored 91 GB-wide voting intention polls during the 2015 election campaign and found nothing in them to prepare me for the final outcome.The good news for the pollsters was that their share for the Lib Dems was pretty close, as were the shares for UKIP, the Greens and the catch-all category of Others.The bad news for the polling industry was that the crucial shares for Conservative and Labour were the ones where they came most adrift.When all the qualifications of margins of error are allowed, there did appear to be a systematic overstatement of the Labour share and an equally systematic understatement of the Conservative one.It is for the pollsters to decide whether to conduct a review of their performance but I trust they will avoid the initial knee-jerk reaction of the immediate aftermath of the 1992 polls debacle.This general election performance follows the performance of the polls in the 2014 Scottish referendum where the choice was simply binary and yet all the polls were out by between 4-6%.Something is wrong. A lot of us would like to know what it is.Read more from David Cowling hereThe words ""political earthquake"" have been translated into numerous European languages, making front page news across the continent.While Britons now examine the domestic minutiae of the election result, here in mainland Europe the vote means one thing: a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU. And that has the potential to create an earthquake of its own.The guardian of the EU treaties Mr Cameron wants to change - Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker - has said again he'd listen to what Britain's new government proposed.Read more from Katya Adler here"

2015-05-16,A history of political plots,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32749971,"Nigel Farage has apparently seen off a challenge to his leadership of UKIP - a move described by his former election strategist as a ""coup"". He's not the only party leader to face an attempted ousting. But can you recover from such a revolt?In 2006, the Labour prime minister was the target of what became known as the ""curry house conspiracy"" - a coup to remove him and install his chancellor, Gordon Brown, as prime minister.It would lead to several of the plotters' resignations - but not Mr Blair's. However, it was successful to a degree in that it forced the party leader into naming a departure date.The move against him was reportedly masterminded by Tom Watson, a defence minister at the time, who was also rumoured to have had a secret meeting with Mr Brown on the eve of the revolt.Apparently, Mr Watson and three fellow West Midlands MPs - Sion Simon, David Wright (both ministerial aides) and Khalid Mahmood - met over a biryani at a Wolverhampton curry house to discuss the PM's future, before dispatching a missive calling for him to quit.The letter - which attracted the support of a number of normally loyal Labour MPs - was leaked to the press, and ultimately resulted in Mr Watson's resignation.In his parting letter, the West Bromwich East MP took a shot at the prime minister, who he said should step down in the interests of party and country.Mr Blair denounced his actions and branded the former minister ""disloyal, discourteous and wrong"", saying he would have sacked him if he had not resigned.But Mr Watson's departure was swiftly followed by the resignations of six other junior members of government - who had also signed the rebel letter - in protest at the prime minister's refusal to say when he would step down as Labour leader.The whole affair resulted in Mr Blair announcing his intention to step aside within 12 months - which he duly did, on 27 June 2007.But it did nothing to quash internal dissent and speculation in the party over the future leadership of the party.Labour prime minister Gordon Brown found his leadership under threat in 2009 after one of his cabinet ministers dramatically quit the government and called for him to resign.Work and Pensions Secretary James Purnell - a former aide to Tony Blair - resigned from his post after the polls closed in the local and European elections, in which Labour was forecast to do badly.Explaining his decision to quit, Mr Purnell said the prime minister made a Conservative victory ""more, not less, likely"".It was Mr Brown's first direct challenge from a cabinet minister - but it would not topple the Labour leader as senior members of government refused to follow Mr Purnell's lead.Mr Brown was safe for the time being. But several months later, in January 2010, a fresh leadership challenge was mounted by two senior former Labour cabinet ministers.Geoff Hoon and Patricia Hewitt wrote to all Labour MPs, saying the party was ""deeply divided"" over Mr Brown's leadership and that the best way to resolve the issue was by way of secret ballot.They insisted it was not an ""attempted coup"" but a necessary step to resolve divisions within the party.But the duo could only muster the public support of a handful of backbenchers long-opposed to Mr Brown, with the majority of the party's MPs less than impressed by the move, which came just weeks before the general election.As the day wore on, a succession of cabinet ministers came out to back the PM, suggesting there was little momentum behind the plot - although it was noted that several were not exactly gushing in their support of Mr Brown.As history tells us, neither leadership challenge bore fruit but they reflected the internal doubts and divisions over Mr Brown at the helm.As leadership toppling attempts go, this one in 2014 was regarded as a particularly ""botched"" and ""shambolic coup"". Indeed, former Lib Dem leader Lord (Paddy) Ashdown described the move as a ""plot of deep malice"".Its instigator, Lord (Matthew) Oakeshott - a close ally of the-then Business Secretary Vince Cable - tried to unseat Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg.The peer was found to have commissioned secret polls suggesting the party would do better at the 2015 general election without Mr Clegg in the driving seat.The man Lord Oakeshott had long had in mind to take Mr Clegg's place - Mr Cable, who was on government business in China at the time - was forced to publicly condemn his friend's actions and state his backing for Mr Clegg.But Lord Oakeshott said the business secretary had in fact known about his polls and their findings.Nevertheless, the peer - who was denounced by the Lib Dem leadership for spending money that could have been spent on campaigning - quit the party, and issued a warning shot on his way out about the Lib Dems' future prospects.Mr Cable largely emerged unscathed but he faced questions about his loyalty to the leader. Although the two sought to put paid to reports of a rift with a (painfully awkward, 'nothing to see here, folks') stage-managed pint in a pub.Although the revolt failed, and Mr Clegg remained at the helm, the Lib Dems did go on to suffer a trouncing at the general election, losing nearly 50 of its MPs - one of them, Mr Cable himself - prompting his leader to quit.The Conservatives have a reputation for being more ruthless than their party rivals when it comes to getting rid of leaders they sense are no longer effectual.But, in 1995, Prime Minister John Major - tired of persistent rumours of a leadership challenge - decided to take the bull by the horns and trigger a surprise leadership election to silence his detractors.His own backbenchers had questioned Mr Major's ability to unite and lead the party, which was deeply divided over Europe.So ""put up or shut up"", he told them as he tendered his resignation as Conservative Party leader but not prime minister.But then stepped forward eurosceptic MP John Redwood, who resigned from the cabinet in order to contest Mr Major's leadership.This was unexpected by many, as the PM had said there had been assurances from his cabinet that none would stand against him.But Mr Major went on to win the ensuing election with a comfortable defeat over his challenger, who was not included in the PM's consequent cabinet reshuffle.No further contested leadership election took place until after the Conservatives' defeat at the 1997 general election, paving the way for William Hague to take over the running of the party.Not all attempts to oust a party leader end in failure: as Margaret Thatcher found out to her peril.With three electoral victories under her belt, the Conservative prime minister's downfall would come at the hands of her own party - not the voters.It was on 1 November 1990 when Geoffrey (now Lord) Howe - one of Mrs Thatcher's longest-serving ministers - resigned over differences with the party leader over Europe.In his now infamous speech on the floor of the House of Commons, he attacked the PM's policies and leadership style, comparing being one of her cabinet ministers to opening the batting at cricket only to find his bat had been ""broken... by the team captain"".It sparked the beginning of the end of the 11-year Thatcher reign.Michael (now Lord) Heseltine seized on the opportunity to challenge the prime minister in the ensuing leadership contest, from which she would eventually withdraw and John Major emerge as her successor. Reflecting on the revolt and its implications on the Conservative Party, Baroness Thatcher's biographer Charles Moore wrote: ""Because the coup was unjustified, and so trust broke down, the politics of the next 15 years were those of civil war."""
2015-05-16,Election swings and roundabouts,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-32741924,"If election manifesto claims are all about smoke and mirrors, should we now add swings and roundabouts to the political metaphor?There's an intriguing aspect to the general election results in the Midlands that puzzled me.It's the striking contrast in the swings between Labour and the Conservatives.David Cameron and his campaign strategists knew they were home and dry when Nuneaton was the first Midlands marginal to declare.It was not only a Tory hold but a swing to the Conservatives from Labour of 3%.I was in the Nottingham suburb of Beeston awaiting the result of the Broxtowe count. Would its high profile Conservative MP Anna Soubry survive a red surge?Nuneaton set the pattern. Across the Midlands, both east and west, there was a uniform swing of between three and four per cent to the Tories - Warwickshire North 3%, Amber Valley 4%, Derbyshire South 4% and Sherwood 4%. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan topped the Tory swingometer in the Midlands marginals with 5% in Loughborough.Yet in the big cities, it was a very different story. The swing went to Labour.So in Nottingham East they enjoyed a 6% swing, Nottingham South 5.8%, Leicester South 7.3%, Leicester West 5%, Birmingham Hall Green 12%, Birmingham Hodge Hill 8%.If swings to Labour on this scale had gone beyond the city ring road roundabouts and into the suburbs, Ed Miliband would have become prime minister by now.In confidence, one senior Labour insider in Nottingham told me its success in the city wards was down to organisation, experience and its teams of activists.""We won the ground war. If Nottingham's city boundaries were extended into Sherwood and Broxtowe, we would have won those constituencies as well,"" he told me.Labour leadership candidate, Leicester West's Liz Kendall has identified her party's problem beyond the ring road roundabout.It's about reaching out to Middle England.""We need to show people that we understand their aspirations and ambitions for the future,"" she told the Sunday Times.The problem for Labour was that Middle England was not interested in what the party offered…and still isn't. The Cameron brand worked its magic in those Midlands marginals... it'll take something or someone special to break up that ballot box relationship."
2015-05-16,Royal 'lobbying',https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32740154,"Prince Charles sent 27 letters to then Prime Minister Tony Blair and members of his government between September 2004 and March 2005, ""despite the Freedom of Information Act!"" as the prince joked in one.But did his suggestions and concerns have any bearing on the behaviour of Mr Blair's government?The request: Prince Charles expresses his worries over an EU directive on complementary medicines ""which is… effectively outlawing the use of certain herbal extracts"".  Mr Blair replied, offering moral support and practical help. He agreed that ""the implementation as it is currently planned is crazy"" and set out an action plan that included delaying implementation for all existing products to 2011. What happened: Herbal products were not required to be authorised until 2011, just as Mr Blair had promised. Prince Charles continues to sell his own brand of complementary products, Duchy Herbals, through Boots and Waitrose. The request: Writing to Mr Blair, the prince expresses a ""growing sense of anxiety"" that the Hill Farming Allowance, which supports farmers working on Britain's uplands, could be scrapped. In his reply, the prime minister said he understood that the Hill Farm Allowance would continue until 2007. What happened: The allowance lasted until the end of Labour's tenure in 2010, when it was abolished.The request: Just 18 months after the US-led invasion of Iraq, Prince Charles raised the issue of poor performance of Lynx helicopters in high temperatures, saying: ""I fear that this is just one more example of where our Armed Forces are being asked to do an extremely challenging job (particularly in Iraq) without the necessary resources.""Mr Blair replied: ""On the subject of the Lynx helicopter, the limitations of the existing platform, particularly in the extremely challenging environment within Iraq, are well recognised by the Ministry of Defence."" He added that replacement of the helicopters would be a priority. What happened: Mr Blair's comments go much further than what he was saying about the subject at the time. In the event, though, the fleet was not fully upgraded until 2011.The request: Prince Charles lamented that the government's TB prevention plans might not ""include a commitment to deal with the badger problem in the immediate future"" and pushed strongly for a cull, saying: ""All I can say is that I do urge you to look again at introducing a proper cull of badgers where it is necessary.""Mr Blair sympathised, saying he could ""personally see the case for culling badgers"". However, he was unwilling to commit to a cull.  What happened: Culling trials were conducted from 1998-2005. The final results, published in 2008, said that the badger cull could ""make no meaningful contribution"" to curbing bovine TB. It wasn't until 2013 that a full culling programme began in two pilot areas. These ended with the conclusion that the pilots had been neither humane nor effective at curbing the spread of TB.The request: Then Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell wrote to Prince Charles to say she had decided to give parts of the historic Smithfield meat market Grade II listed status, and was trying to persuade deputy prime minister John Prescott to ""call in"" the planning application to prevent demolition of other parts of the site. She had been swayed by evidence provided by Sir Neil Cossons, who was English Heritage chair at the time, after he had been asked by the prince to add his support. Prince Charles replied that he was ""extremely glad to read of your appreciation of the value of this group of buildings"". According to the Guardian, market workers desperate to see the redevelopment of the site invited the prince to meet them to discuss it, but his office said he was ""unlikely to accept as he did not want to interfere in the planning process"".What happened: Smithfield market is still the subject of planning battles a decade on. Successive planning applications have been refused by ministers. Last year then Communities Secretary Eric Pickles rejected plans for an office development on the site, stating that ""the extent of damage that the application would cause to the important heritage assets at Smithfield runs entirely counter to national and policy objectives intended to protect such assets from harm"".In March, the Museum of London announced a move from its current Barbican site to the Smithfield market building."
2015-05-16,Election fallout,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32703139,"""Some of those gimmicks - that tombstone, whatever idiot thought that up I do not know!""I was talking to the former Mayor of Crawley in Sussex, John Mortimer, in the town's Labour Supporters Club about the vexed question of what went wrong, and where Labour should go next. This seat is one of those southern seats Labour hoped to take, but failed.I hear a whole range of views in the club.""They didn't give nothing to depend on, they should be clear, and a little bit more down to Earth."" ""Good party, wrong leader, they don't look after business enough.""Councillor John Stanley tells me: ""I think in a way we did go too left, but now we can go a bit centre-left, or centre, depending who the new leader is.""The former mayor sums up the mood on the doorstep: ""Whatever we told them, they didn't believe us.""  Expect to hear all those views, and more, in the coming leadership contest. Step back from the angst of supporters, and it may not be that hard to see why Labour failed.  An economic recovery, hailed by independent organisations as the result of government policy, undid a party that had loudly proclaimed for five years that the coalition's policies would lead to economic disaster. Combine that with an uncharismatic and uninspirational leader, then you might argue no further debate is necessary.Fat chance of that. Defeat breeds resentment, and this one has opened up old divisions.  A chorus of Blairties, led by the man himself, has declared that Ed's problem was ignoring those with aspiration and ambition, failing to appeal to those running business. Incidentally, I've been ticked off by the perspicacious editor of the New Statesman, Jason Cowley, for using the ""unhelpful"" term ""Blairites"".I can't think of another description that fits Tony, Lord Mandelson, Lord Adonis and David Miliband quite so well. But call them what you will, the message was clear - Ed was too left wing, Labour should move back to the centre, or, if you like, to the right.Reading Mr Blair's pithy analysis, listening to Lord Mandelson's gripping and savage eloquence, describing a party sent out to shout: ""We love the poor and hate the rich,"" and so ignoring the middle, and you realise strong emotions are in play.But back to the future may not be sufficient. Of course elections are won on the centre ground. But grandees grinding axes, affronted by the failure of boys who used to make their tea, may be creating so much noise that they can't hear more insistent sounds.  For there are several elephants trumpeting loudly as they cram into the small space of the shadow cabinet room. Imagine these beasts are as gaily decorated as Berlin buddy bears. One is decked out in red, another in imperial purple bunting, and another, a mammoth, strong tusked and ice rimmed, painted yellow with tartan trimmings.Take the last first. The Scottish wipeout is Labour's biggest problem. Fail to solve it, and Labour can forget ever having a comfortable majority again. It is hard to argue Labour were wiped out in Scotland because the SNP outflanked them to the right with their appeal to the business community and the ambitious and aspirational. But it is true the SNP drew in to people from left, right and centre, just as the modernisers say Labour should. It was the politics of economic self-interest, but cast in a very different light. Tribally sneering at ""the reactionary ideology of nationalism"" as Mr Blair does, will not reach the central belt of Scotland, the middle ground of  Midlothian.What about that purple pachyderm?  In Crawley - in fact in seat after seat - there is a similar pattern.  Labour did, in fact, often increase the size of their vote. So did the Conservatives, usually by a bit more. But the real dynamic was the total collapse of the Lib Dems and the dramatic rise of UKIP. The increase in votes for Nigel Farage's party wasn't translated into parliamentary seats, but, although it is early days in terms of research, it probably hurt Labour a lot. If we believe - and I do - Matthew Goodwin and Rob Ford, authors of Revolt on the Right, these voters are often former Labour supporters - older, less educated, those left behind on the tides of  globalisation, stranded on the shores of post-industrialisation. They may have had too many disappointments to feel much ambition or aspiration. They are a challenge for Labour, and any new leader will spend a good deal of time thinking how to deal with the concerns of Europe and immigration.Whether to share their fears, or confront them will be a big decision.Which brings us to Red Nellie. Those members who still proudly call themselves socialist. This is not about Old Labour - they are more likely to be baristas or barristers than boilermakers. It is easy as an outsider, as a journalist, to treat politics as an intellectual game about how best to win power - but many people, particularly the foot soldiers, particularly after the death of  purely tribal loyalties, are in it because they passionately believe in winning  power to do something specific.Many of them are suspicious of the later incarnations of New Labour, not because it reached an accommodation with wealth and business, but because it seemed to worship at the same altar, to regard the party's core beliefs in redistribution and equality as childish fantasies from a past age.Perhaps to Mr Blair, they are the problem, people who may equate ""ambition"" with greed. They might point out that a man who claims to be worth ""only"" £20m may find it harder than most to squeeze through the eye of a needle to understand their point of view. Most successful Labour leaders will confront the left at some point, but the concerns of this group go to the existential question ""What is the party for?""This is not a polemic - not an argument about what should be done, but a reflection on the complex conundrums that will face any new Labour leader, the tearing apart of the old alliance that made up a Labour majority, and so the political need to satisfy groups with very different, indeed, contradictory demands. But looking for a Social Democratic universal theory of everything may be missing the point. What the party desperately wants is a leader who can pull the disparate threads together and articulate them as common purpose. Whether she or he exists is another matter.Much more on that in the coming months."
2015-05-16,'Take us with you',https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-32736153,"Thousands of people in the north of England have been using the hashtag ""take us with you Scotland"" to express their upset about the result of last week's general election, and Scottish nationalists are welcoming this English minority with open arms. Last Thursday's general election was a rough one for the Labour Party in its traditional stronghold in the north of England. But further to the north, the left-leaning Scottish National Party won nearly every seat it contested. That political contrast has made some left-wing voters in places like Manchester, Leeds and Sheffield look fondly on their neighbours. Since last Thursday's election in Britain the phrase ""take us with you Scotland"" has been used more than 24,000 times. ""Genuinely beginning to wonder if the North of England becoming a part of Scotland would be better for us, I really am,"" tweeted Aaron Miller from Yorkshire. Some cracked jokes under the tag after the North West Motorway Police account, which gives traffic updates, announced that they had ""picked up a pedestrian on the M62 who was trying to walk to Scotland.""After an initial spike of jokes over the weekend, the hashtag really took off when users start to mobilise in support of around a year-old petition on the campaigning site Change.org. The petition calls for the north of England to secede from the rest of the country and join up with Scotland, and more than 12,000 people have signed it.Its creator, a Sheffield resident who calls himself ""Stu Dent"", set it up to coincide with last year's Scottish independence referendum, and he also created a map imagining the boundary of a ""Scotland plus the north"" country.Stu Dent runs the Twitter account Hunters Bar, named after an area of southwest Sheffield which is very popular with - you guessed it - students. Despite the account having thousands of followers on Twitter, when the map was first posted last year, the image was shared only about 100 times - however, in the past week it's been retweeted by thousands. Stu Dent told BBC Trending that he was surprised at how popular his idea has become. ""In hindsight, perhaps I shouldn't have been,"" he said. ""There is a huge frustration in parts of the UK about the things that have happened since 2010.""""I think people need a place to go where they can say 'not in my name! This is not the England I want',"" he added. But in addition to disappointment from some quarters about the election result, there might be another reason why the petition is getting a boost now: the power of the Scottish Nationalists on Twitter. What started as a post-election joke in the North of England was quickly embraced by the so-called ""Cyber Nats"" - and a trend was born.The SNP's social media strategist Ross Colquhoun expressed the party's mood about the hashtag best, in a post which was shared more than 500 times. ""2014: #LetsStayTogether 2015: #TakeUsWithYouScotland What a difference a year makes"" he tweeted.Blog by Hannah HendersonNext story: The sport reporter and the obscene ranter who lost his jobFollow BBC Trending on Twitter @BBCtrending, and find us on Facebook."
2015-05-16,What Britain wants from Europe,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32695399,"David Cameron says he has a mandate to pursue EU reform following the Conservatives' general election victory. The PM, who will be hoping his majority government will give him extra leverage in Brussels, wants to renegotiate the terms of the UK's membership ahead of a referendum by the end of 2017. He has said he will campaign for Britain to remain in the EU if he gets the reforms he wants.Mr Cameron has said he does not want to reveal full details of his negotiating hand but he has given a broad indication, in a series of speeches and newspaper articles, of his priorities when he goes into talks with other EU leaders.These are: The prime minister has said Britain would resist any move towards a European Army and that he wants to free British police forces from EU interference. He has also ruled out Britain joining the euro.But he has placed less emphasis in recent years on demanding changes to EU social policy, such as the maximum 48-hour working week, agency workers, maternity leave and non-discrimination rules.The official UK government position is that a referendum will be held by the end of 2017 but Downing Street sources have said: ""If we can do it earlier we will.""There is speculation David Cameron is planning to hold the vote in 2016 to avoid a clash with French and German elections in 2017.The prime minister wants treaty change but even if the referendum was held in 2017 there may not be enough time to legally incorporate any reforms into a treaty and it would have to be done at a later stage.An early referendum would anger Eurosceptics who believe it would not allow enough time to make the case for exit or negotiate any meaningful concessions.""A rushed process would severely undermine the chances to secure a significant deal that both British business and voters could support and would waste the opportunity of a lifetime,"" Matthew Elliott, chief executive of Business for Britain told Breitbart London.The question is always crucial in any referendum and there is already a debate about what it should be. The Draft European Union (Referendum) Bill, published by the Conservatives in 2013, proposed this form of words: ""Do you think that the United Kingdom should remain a member of the European Union?""Some thought that leaned too far towards the status quo, encouraging a yes vote, and the Electoral Commission said it was not clear and direct enough. The watchdog proposed this form of words instead: ""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union?""The new Conservative government will attempt to repeal the Human Rights Act, which requires UK courts to treat the European Court of Human Rights as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. The European Court of Human Rights is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe (CoE), which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine.The freedom for people to move around Europe, enshrined in the EU treaties, works in parallel with the other three basic freedoms in the single market: freedom of goods, capital and services.It is likely to be a ""red line"" for other EU leaders, who do not want to see it eroded.Mr Cameron has steered clear of tackling it directly - for example by asking for an emergency ""brake"" on free movement, or a cap on numbers - focusing instead on reducing the incentive provided by welfare payments. In a speech last November, David Cameron set out measures to reduce the number of EU nationals moving to the UK.His main proposals were:Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission, has said he is ready to work with Mr Cameron to ""strike a fair deal for the United Kingdom in the EU"". The leaders of other EU nations have previously warned they are unlikely to support major changes to EU treaties to accommodate British demands. But Mr Cameron's general election victory may have given him extra leverage. ""The ball is very much in the court of the UK now,"" a senior EU official told The Guardian. ""It's up to the British to define what they want."" The key figure will be German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is very keen to keep Britain in the EU but has so far been unwilling to make major concessions to enable that to happen. There are fears that a ""pick and mix"" approach to EU treaties would undermine EU cohesion.Mr Cameron has said there is ""no doubt"" his planned reforms will require changes to the treaties governing the European Union. But this would require the unanimous support of all EU members, and may not be possible within the deadline he has set of a referendum before the end of 2017. Any attempt to change EU laws on free movement would meet fierce resistance from some EU nations, particularly Eastern European states. Mr Juncker has said free movement is non-negotiable.Mr Cameron may find it difficult to get unanimous support for his proposals for a four-year waiting period for migrant workers claiming UK benefits. East European EU members would be likely to oppose this, on the grounds that it would discriminate against their citizens.  Attempts to secure opt-outs for the City are unlikely to go down well with other European leaders.However, there are precedents for EU treaty changes to accommodate some countries' specific concerns - for example, the protocol attached to the Lisbon Treaty for Ireland.Mr Cameron has faced repeated calls to say whether he would campaign for Britain's exit from the EU in the referendum if he fails to get what he wants from the renegotiation process. All he has said is that he will ""rule nothing out"". Some Conservative MPs want Britain to leave the EU no matter what David Cameron manages to renegotiate. A larger group are likely to want more concessions than Mr Cameron has so far indicated he is prepared to demand.Senior backbencher David Davis, who was defeated by Mr Cameron for the Tory leadership in 2005, told the Daily Telegraph the majority of the 332 Conservative MPs want Mr Cameron to negotiate an ""opt-out"" power to stop individual EU laws from applying to Britain. The prime minister has said this would be ""impossible"" without Britain leaving the EU.Mr Davis claims as many as 60 Tory MPs would be prepared to rebel and vote for Britain's exit from the EU if the prime minister fails to deliver.Graham Brady, chairman of the Tory backbench 1922 committee, which represents backbenchers, has urged David Cameron to give all Conservative MPs, including ministers, a free vote in the EU referendum.In January, Mr Cameron warned that serving cabinet ministers would have to quit the government if they wanted to campaign to leave the EU if he had secured the reforms to it he wants.In the 1975 referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Economic Community, as the EU was then called, Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson decided to suspend collective responsibility because his cabinet was split on the issue. Ministers were allowed to vote with their consciences and campaign against each other. The majority of them, including Mr Wilson, joined the Yes camp, but left-wingers, such as Tony Benn, played a leading role in the No campaign. The Yes campaign won easily with 67% of the vote."

2015-05-17,Scots Labour leader Murphy to resign,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32760196,"Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy is to resign next month, he has announced.It comes despite Mr Murphy narrowly surviving a vote of no confidence at a meeting of the party's national executive in Glasgow. Mr Murphy said he would tender his resignation alongside a plan to reform the party.He lost his seat in last week's general election as the SNP won 56 of the 59 Scottish seats, leaving Labour with a single MP in Scotland.Mr Murphy said he wanted to have a successor as leader in place by the summer, and confirmed he would not be standing for a seat at the Scottish Parliament in next year's election. Instead, he said it was time to ""do something else"" and that he believed the party would continue to be divided if he remained as leader. His deputy, Kezia Dugdale MSP, will become acting leader until a permanent successor is found. Mr Murphy had faced calls to resign from several MSPs, trade unions and former MPs in the wake of his party's near wipeout at the general election.He insisted he had decided to stand down ahead of the national executive voting by 17-14 in favour of him staying in the job.Speaking at a media conference after the national executive meeting, he said: ""It is clear that a small minority who didn't accept my election as leader of the Scottish Labour Party just five months ago won't accept the vote of the executive today and that will continue to divide the party.""Today I received more support in the executive vote than I did from members of the executive when I stood for election five months ago.""He said it would be up to the executive whether to accept the reforms he would be proposing before he left the post. But he warned: ""A party in such urgent need of reform blocks those changes at its peril.""The former East Renfrewshire MP said Labour had been crushed between ""two nationalisms"" in Scotland and England.Mr Murphy said he left no legacy of bitterness for anyone in the Labour Party, and the only person he was angry at was the person who blamed Scottish Labour for the party's UK-wide general election defeat - a reference to Unite leader Len McCluskey.And he said that in many ways Scottish Labour was the ""least modernised part of the Labour movement"" and that he wanted his successor to be elected under a one member, one vote system.Mr Murphy added: ""The Labour Party's problem is not the link with trade unions, or even the relationship with Unite members - far from it. It is the destructive behaviour of one high profile trade unionist.""The leader of the Scottish Labour Party doesn't serve at the grace of Len McCluskey, and the next leader of the UK Labour Party should not be picked by Len McCluskey.""Mr McCluskey has been a vocal critic of Mr Murphy's leadership and opposed his appointment in December when Mr Murphy won the contest to replace Johann Lamont.Jim Murphy laughed and joked with Scottish Labour's sole MP as he made his way down the hotel corridor to announce his resignation.He certainly brought energy and dynamism to his election campaign - but all that achieved was Ian Murray in Edinburgh South.So as Mr Murphy bows out, who could replace him?The deputy leader Kezia Dugdale may want to step up or Neil Findlay could try again after challenging last time. Maybe the party's finance spokeswoman Jackie Baillie thinks her steady hand could steer the ship.Jenny Marra is also often talked about as future face of the party.Whoever steps into Jim Murphy's red shoes he or she will have to face a difficult 2016 Holyrood election, to put it mildly.There are also more fundamental questions about how the party can possibly move on as it faces a surging SNP.Mr Murphy was very much a creature of ""New Labour"" - but to today's generation that's old Labour.Party members may start looking for someone with no links to the past, neither a Brownite nor a Blairite. A 'cleanskin' - as the politicos put it - may well help re-connect with voters.That's a long way from now though - even some of the party's opponents may view this latest train wreck with a modicum of sympathy. Ms Lamont had resigned after claiming Scottish Labour was treated like a ""branch office"" by the London-based party leadership.Mr Murphy concluded his speech by saying: ""Scotland needs a strong Labour party; Scotland needs a united Labour party. We have been the greatest force for change in our nation's remarkable history. ""The Scottish Labour party will rise again. It will be under someone else's leadership and I am confident about my party's future.""Harriet Harman MP, acting leader of the UK Labour Party, said it would be for Scottish Labour to choose a new leader. She added: ""As a cabinet minister and leader of his party in Scotland, Jim has been a hugely important figure in the Labour Party. He leaves with the best wishes and thanks of our movement.""Labour peer Lord McConnell, a former Scottish first minister, said the party's problems were ""much deeper than one individual and one affiliate"".He said: ""We have a disconnect locally and nationally with wider Scottish society. ""We have a problem with our political positioning in the post devolution age where the party particularly at the UK level has never been comfortable with success in the Scottish parliament and has always tried to see things through a UK prism rather than a Scottish prism.""We need to find a new generation, a new leader, new generation, new ideas, a fresh approach.""In a tweet, Scottish first minister and SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said: ""I wish Jim Murphy all the very best for the future. Leadership is not easy and he deserves credit for standing up for what he believes in.""Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson also reacted on Twitter, saying: ""Jim Murphy announces a managed exit in order to help the party, which is to his credit. But leaves a tough gig for whoever comes next.""The meeting of Scottish Labour's executive was disrupted by protesters who entered the party's headquarters.Police were called and the protesters, who included persistent anti-austerity activists Sean Clerkin and Piers Doughty-Brown, left the building to protest further from the street outside.The protesters were calling for Mr Murphy to remain as leader to ""finish the job of destroying Scottish Labour"".A Police Scotland spokeswoman said officers had been called and found two protestors on the third floor of the building. She added: ""Both left on police arrival. Advice and assistance was given."""

I don't think the Labour Party any more represents the working people of this country who aspire to a better life."""

I'm not suggesting he takes a break from being leader.""Clearly the national executive has the authority, they're the ruling body. ""I'm told that they made a decision. I'm told it was a procedurally correct decision, he is the leader but I think it's important that as leader he takes a break and I think it's important that we work out how these complex questions are answered by a team.""No one person has all the answers. I'm particularly concerned about tone, making sure we get a tone that ensures that the 27 million people who didn't vote for UKIP last week may be persuaded to vote for us in future.""The party has been beset by wrangling since Mr Farage agreed to stay on as leader, days after standing down after failing to get elected in Thanet South.He had pledged before the general election that he would quit the post if he failed to get elected to Parliament.Senior aide Matthew Richardson has left the party, following claims from MEP Patrick O'Flynn that Mr Farage had fallen under the influence of ""inexperienced"" advisers.UKIP has also confirmed the departure of Mr Farage's chief of staff Raheem Kassam.Mr Farage ruled out quitting as leader on BBC's Question Time on Thursday, saying he had ""phenomenal"" support, and has challenged his critics to decide whether they want to stay in the party.In his article, Mr Carswell had said that ""knowing how difficult it is to lead a party makes me admire Nigel Farage all the more"".""I know that I never could,"" he added, stressing that he would find it ""impossible to simultaneously lead UKIP, be the voice of the party in the Commons, represent my Clacton constituents and at the same time be a husband and a dad"".However, he said that ""even leaders need to take a break"", adding: ""Nigel needs to take a break now.""UKIP got nearly four million votes at the election, but returned only one MP - former Conservative Mr Carswell in the Clacton constituency."
2015-05-17,Coasting schools 'must improve',https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/education-32763097,"Education Secretary Nicky Morgan has said new powers to sack head teachers in coasting schools will show ""it is not OK to be just above the level of failing"". Under the plans, ministers could force schools rated as ""requiring improvement"" and missing new government benchmarks to become an academy.Coasting schools have average results which have often flatlined over time.Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, Mrs Morgan said faster action was needed.She said: ""Our big priorities will be to speed up the process for tackling failing schools; extend our academies programme to tackle 'coasting' schools; and deliver on our commitment to open new free schools.""The proposals will be in a new bill due to be introduced in the Queen's Speech. ""First, we will take new powers to step in from the moment that a school is found to be failing,"" Mrs Morgan said.""From day one, regional schools commissioners will be able to bring in new leadership and support from other excellent schools and heads, and we will speed up the process of turning schools into academies to make sure that new expert leadership is found for all schools that need it as quickly as possible.""She said that coasting schools will be put on an immediate notice to improve and could then be taken over and turned into an academy.They will be required to work with a team of ""expert"" head teachers.She said: ""Those that aren't able to demonstrate a clear plan for improvement will be given new leadership - we know this works in turning schools around.""More than 3,300 schools in England are labelled ""requires improvement"", but the plans are unlikely to cover that many schools.Under the current system, secondary schools are considered to be failing, and therefore eligible for intervention, if fewer than 40% of their students score at least five Cs at GCSE, including English and maths, and they do not meet national averages in pupil progress.In primary schools, the threshold for intervention is if fewer than 65% of pupils get Level 4 in reading, writing and maths and a below average number of pupils make the expected amount of progress.It is not yet clear how coasting schools will be deemed in need of intervention.It is understood that a new category will be devised covering schools which are rated as ""requires improvement"" and which fail to meet a new set of standards on improvement."
2015-05-17,Co-op Group to keep political funding,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-32762858,"The Co-operative Group has decided to continue financially supporting the Co-operative Party, which has strong ties to Labour.Members of the group, the UK's biggest mutual organisation, voted on the issue at their annual general meeting.They passed a motion by 48,579 for, to 39,479 against, to approve ""political expenditures"" of up to £1m which support the movement's objectives.Last year the Co-op Group gave £625,000 to the Co-op Party.This figure was down on the sums donated in previous years. The AGM also included a vote on new corporate governance procedures which would mean members having less of a direct say.The Co-operative Group is still recovering from a period of financial mismanagement and some members have recently expressed concerns about how elections to the board are chosen.The banking arm of the group came close to collapse in 2013, bringing the whole group to a £2.5bn annual loss that year. The Co-op Party includes among its members a number of Labour MPs, including shadow chancellor Chris Leslie and Walthamstow MP Stella Creasy. The politicians stand as candidates of both the Co-operative Party and the Labour Party, and the two political movements have strong historical ties. The board asked the members of the Co-operative Group whether they wanted to continue financially supporting the Co-operative Party, or any other party. Allan Leighton, chairman of the Co-op Group, said: ""There's a clear remit from the members to continue to support the Labour Party.""It allows us to now have a conversation with the Co-op Labour Party about what we do next.""There was also a members' motion on the agenda, put forward by those in favour of making political donations of up to £1m a year.The motion to approve political funding ""not to exceed £1m per annum"" was carried by 55.17% to 44.83%.BBC business correspondent Joe Lynam said: ""To meet a £1.5bn hole in its accounts - mostly stemming from its banking division - the Co-op Group has had to sell off parts of its businesses and hand over majority control of its bank to American hedge funds.""It's also in the process of radically changing the way it runs itself into a more corporate structure with less of a direct say by its members.""He said that ""in theory"", each of the 2.8 million Co-op members could vote on a series of motions about the reforms, as well as how its bosses are paid, and retaining the links to the Co-operative party.One of the group's largest independent societies, Midcounties, recently threatened legal action over a shortlist of six candidates for the group's board being reduced to three - the number of positions available - before a member vote.

2015-05-17,Osborne plans July 'stability' Budget,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32761566,"Chancellor George Osborne has said that he will deliver a new Budget on 8 July.He claimed it would have ""a laser-like focus"" on raising productivity and living standards.He said he was making the unusual move of having a second Budget in one year in order to ""deliver on the commitments we have made to working people"".Labour said the chancellor would have to set out ""who is going to pay"" for what it called ""uncosted promises"" in the election campaign.Speaking outside 11 Downing Street, the chancellor gave a broad outline of his plans for the forthcoming Budget but refused to be drawn on the details, including the Conservatives' planned £12bn of welfare cuts.""I don't want to wait to deliver on the commitments we have made to working people,"" he said.""It will continue with the balanced plan we have to deal with our debts, invest in our health service and reform welfare to make work pay.""But there will also be a laser-like focus on making our economy more productive so we raise living standards across our country.""We're going to put Britain into good shape for the long term.""The last Budget was held on 18 March and included tax cuts for first-time house buyers.Writing in the Sun, Mr Osborne admitted it was ""unusual"" to have two Budgets in the same year, but he wanted to turn ""promises made in the election into a reality"".Again, Mr Osborne did not specifically outline how the Conservatives plan to fulfil a pledge to cut £12bn in welfare spending but said he wants to make the welfare system ""fair for the people who pay for it"".He writes: ""We will protect the NHS and give it more funding each and every year, while making savings across Whitehall. ""We'll crack down hard on tax avoidance and aggressive tax planning by the rich - because everyone should pay their fair share.  ""We will always protect the most vulnerable, but we also need a welfare system that's fair to the people who pay for it. If you can work you should be working, so we'll take the next steps in our benefit reforms to make sure that happens.""Second, we've got to go on helping businesses create jobs in Britain, so we move towards full employment. That means facing a hard truth: in Britain we produce about a quarter less for every hour we work than countries like America or Germany. Fixing that long-running productivity weakness is the big challenge for the next five years.""So in the Budget we'll spend less on welfare, and instead invest to create three million more apprenticeships, so that young people can learn a trade, get better jobs and earn more.""After the Budget in March independent forecaster the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said that Mr Osborne needed to spell out exactly how he plans to cut £12bn from welfare spending.Of those £12bn planned cuts, £2bn were outlined ahead of the general election - all the cuts are supposed to be in place by 2017-18.Labour's shadow energy and climate change secretary, Caroline Flint, accused the Tories of making ""a number of uncosted promises"" during the election campaign.She told the BBC: ""It will be interesting to see who is going to pay for those uncosted policies when they bring the Budget in July."""

If it isn't, stop it and do something else.""He also criticised Mr Farage's comments about HIV patients during the TV leaders' debate last month.While debating about the NHS, Mr Farage said: ""You can come into Britain from anywhere in the world and get diagnosed with HIV and get the retro-viral drugs that cost up to £25,000 per year per patient.""Mr Carswell wrote: ""By all means we should highlight the problem of health tourism. But we need to admit that using the example of HIV patients to make the point was ill-advised.""He said the party needed to strike ""the right tone"" and added: ""UKIP has been at its most persuasive when we have been most optimistic.""Anger is never a great way to motivate people - at least not for very long.""The party has been beset by wrangling since Mr Farage agreed to stay on as leader, days after standing down after failing to get elected in Thanet South.He had pledged before the general election that he would quit the post if he failed to get elected to Parliament.Matthew Richardson has left the party, following claims from MEP Patrick O'Flynn that Mr Farage had fallen under the influence of ""inexperienced"" advisers.

They absolutely loved how he helped them and he was a highly-regarded local MP,"" Mr Bone said.""He stood up for what was right rather than what the party line was. In those days - the John Major years - it was much more difficult to stand up against the party machine. He had strong views on Europe.""Sir Peter started his career as an insurance broker, joining the Wycombe Young Conservatives in 1949 and the Oxford University Conservative Association in 1951.He went on to become a Conservative councillor on Buckinghamshire County Council between 1961 and 1967.Wellingborough mayor-elect Barry Graves also paid tribute to Sir Peter, remembering him as a ""very strong constituency MP"".""I remember going out and canvassing with him and he would go everywhere. He knew the area and the people. He was very much a man of the local constituency.""He was ""a very approachable man"", Mr Graves added.Sir Peter was knighted in 1994. "

2015-05-17,PM will 'look at' powers proposals,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32746049,"David Cameron has said he would ""look at"" any proposals for further powers for Scotland but wants to get the Smith Commission plans implemented first.The prime minister was speaking after meeting Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon in Edinburgh.Mr Cameron said he made a ""commitment"" to include a devolution bill in the Queen's Speech later this month.Ms Sturgeon argued the Smith Commission proposals were ""a good starting point"" but did not go far enough.The prime minister has pledged to include a bill on devolution in this month's Queen's Speech which would be based on the cross-party Smith Commission agreement. The Smith proposals included giving Holyrood the power to set income tax rates and bands, as well as control over a share of VAT and some welfare benefits. But Ms Sturgeon's SNP also wants the Scottish Parliament to be given powers over business taxes, employment law, the minimum wage and additional powers over welfare.Speaking after meeting Ms Sturgeon, Mr Cameron told the BBC: ""Let's make sure Smith is implemented in full. I'm going to keep the commitment I made to the people of Scotland. Let's get that done first because it does create a really strong Scottish Parliament.""He added: ""Of course, if people want to make future proposals I'll look at them.""The prime minister again said he did not support full fiscal autonomy for Scotland - the responsibility for all areas of tax and spending except defence and foreign affairs - stating that it would mean £7bn of cuts or extra tax-raising.What Nicola Sturgeon is trying to say is she has a mandate. She has 56 out of the 59 MPs elected in Scotland and she won 50% of the vote - unprecedented here in Scotland.She says that gives her leverage to push David Cameron. David Cameron says he wants to keep the nation together.The language coming out of Westminster last week was very much a cordial one. 'We will listen'.Nicola Sturgeon has warned him that if he doesn't listen, then the people of Scotland will judge him accordingly.Ms  Sturgeon described the hour-long talks at her official residence at Bute House as ""constructive and business-like"". She said Mr Cameron had made a ""commitment"" that the Smith proposals would be implemented ""as agreed"".""But secondly the prime minister agreed that he would look at proposals that we would now send to suggest the areas we can go beyond Smith,"" Ms Sturgeon said.""There was no agreement in terms of the substance of that but we will submit those proposals, the prime minister has said they will consider them and there will be a meeting to look at how we take that further forward.""Referring to her party's success in last week's general election, which saw the SNP win 56 out of 59 Scottish seats, Ms Sturgeon said: ""People in Scotland have now voted fairly convincingly for the SNP and sent a message that we want the Smith Commission proposals to go further and be built on.""The ball is in his court but I'm going into this in good faith.""She added: ""David Cameron and I are a world apart politically but, where we can, I'm determined to do business in the interests of the people of Scotland and across the UK.""She said she would have a ""constructive and business-like"" relationship with the prime minister. The two leaders shook hands on the front steps of Bute House as Mr Cameron arrived. Mr Cameron left the building shortly before 11:00, almost an hour after he had arrived.The two sides agreed to hold more regular discussions in the future, possibly quarterly. "

I'm human, the rest of my life is more important to me than politics.""The shadow business secretary has been distressed by the degree of scrutiny he, his family and his girlfriend have come under since he declared his intention to stand for the labour leadership.I am told that this includes reporters waiting outside the houses of relatives late at night.Friends of Mr Umunna deny that he is nervous of not getting the support of enough MPs to run for the leadership; they point out that he already has half the necessary names and that there are some weeks to go.The shadow business secretary now wants to play a leading role in arguing that Britain should stay in the EU and does not rule out seeking the leadership in the future.He said he thought he had understood ""the scrutiny and attention a leadership contest would bring"", but added: ""However, since the night of our defeat last week I have been subject to the added level of pressure that comes with being a leadership candidate.""The shadow business secretary said he had wondered if it was too soon for him to stand for the leadership, and ""I fear it was."" He also cited concerns about the impact on ""the rest of one's life"" and those close to him.""Consequently, after further reflection, I am withdrawing my candidacy,"" he said.Mr Umunna said he would continue to serve as shadow business secretary and hoped to ""play a leading role"" in Labour's campaign to keep the UK in the EU during the forthcoming in/out referendum.Commenting on the news, Labour former culture secretary Ben Bradshaw - who is expected to run for deputy leader - said Mr Umunna was a ""terrible loss"" to the field.He told the BBC's Daily Politics the Streatham MP had been the candidate the Conservative Party ""feared the most"".""And if it's the result of pressure on an extended family or an extended group of friends, I think that's a very sad reflection on our political culture,"" he said.Chuka Umunna feels ""liberated"", he told me, by his decision to quit the Labour leadership race.He hopes to be given a good role (shadow chancellor, I wonder?) by whoever becomes Labour leader. And I expect he'll become very high profile in the campaign to keep Britain in Europe, which is increasingly looking like it will be next May.He'll endorse a candidate in the next four weeks before nominations close. It will be very interesting to see who he piles in behind.Read more from Allegra (see post 13.23).Former Labour leader Lord Kinnock said he thought Mr Umunna had made the right decision.He said: ""If he felt in his soul that he wasn't prepared to subject himself - and more importantly his family - to the kind of attention which is fairly typical, sadly, these days, he has done absolutely the right thing.""There is no point at all in inflicting avoidable, unnecessary misery on those you love most.""Leadership contender Mary Creagh said she had ""huge respect"" for Mr Umunna, telling BBC Radio 4's World at One programme it took ""courage"" to withdraw from the leadership race.Mr Umunna was ""a big beast"" and would play a ""big role"" in the future of the Labour Party, she added.Yvette Cooper, Andy Burnham, Liz Kendall and Mary Creagh have already thrown their hats into the ring for Labour's top job while a number of other potential candidates, including Dan Jarvis, Alan Johnson and David Lammy, have ruled themselves out. Candidates must secure nominations from 34 colleagues - 15% of the party's MPs - by 15 June to make it on to ballot papers, which will be sent to members in August ahead of the leader's election a month later."

However, Mr Justice Stuart Smith at Southwark Crown Court said there was a ""very strong likelihood"" a custodial sentence would follow.The jury heard how Mote submitted numerous false expenses claims for payment for work that organisations had allegedly carried out on his behalf.Mote claimed the money was to pay whistleblowers in cash through third parties. He also said he had been ""targeted for being an anti-EU MEP.""During his time an MEP he also made £250,000 legitimate expenses claims.No date has been set for the sentencing."

Governing parties don't gain seats. Parties that have implemented painful cuts and are promising more certainly don't. Until that is the Conservative Party did - achieving what had seemed to be Mission Impossible - a Tory majority.Until that is David Cameron's personal triumph which triggered the near simultaneous resignation of his three principal opponents - Messrs Miliband, Clegg and Farage.   They did so in part because they helped to crush their partners in coalition these last five years - reducing the Liberal Democrat parliamentary party to a size when it can fit into two London taxis and still have two seats to spare. In part because the extraordinary tidal wave of support for the SNP swept dozens of once safe Labour seats away.In part because Nigel Farage persuaded millions to vote for him but secured just one seat - not, though, the one he was standing in.But - and this is critical - because Labour performed worse overall than it had under Gordon Brown in the immediate aftermath of the worst financial crisis of modern times.

2015-05-17,Round-up: BBC experts' analysis,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/election-2015-32650417,"The political future of the United Kingdom has become clearer after the results of the general election emerged around the country.David Cameron says he hopes to govern for all of the UK after the Conservatives took 331 seats - enough to form a slender majority in the Commons.Labour has been all but wiped out by the SNP in Scotland and suffered a disappointing set of results elsewhere, while the Lib Dems are left with just eight MPs after many party heavyweights such as Vince Cable and Danny Alexander lost their seats.So with battles won and lost and the fall-out and celebrations beginning, BBC correspondents examine the implications and challenges that lie ahead for the new government - and for those whose political careers have been ended by voters.No pollster, no pundit, no political leader saw it coming - not even David Cameron himself.Governing parties don't gain seats. Parties that have implemented painful cuts and are promising more certainly don't. Until that is the Conservative Party did - achieving what had seemed to be Mission Impossible - a Tory majority.Until that is David Cameron's personal triumph which triggered the near simultaneous resignation of his three principle opponents - Messrs Miliband, Clegg and Farage.They did so in part because they helped to crush their partners in coalition these last five years - reducing the Liberal Democrat parliamentary party to a size when it can fit into two London taxis and still have two seats to spare.In part because the extraordinary tidal wave of support for the SNP swept dozens of once safe Labour seats away.In part because Nigel Farage persuaded millions to vote for him but secured just one seat - not, though, the one he was standing in.Read more from Nick Robinson hereThe question uppermost in the prime minister's mind as he assembles his new government is how to keep the kingdom united.""Above all I want to bring our country together,"" he revealed after the result, ""to reclaim a mantle we should never have lost - the mantle of one nation, one United Kingdom"".Looking at the political landscape from Land's End today is very different to the view from John O'Groats.A sea of Conservative and Unionist blue dominates the scene across much of England, while a field of SNP nationalist yellow stretches to the horizon and beyond from the north.David Cameron's greatest challenge is to prevent the union he supports being torn apart by mutual resentment - resentment from Scotland at a Westminster government dominated by English Tories, and resentment from England at the preferential treatment people think is being given to the Scots.Those who assumed the future of the Union had been safeguarded by the Scottish referendum must think again.Read more from Mark Easton hereOne thing is rock-solid true: the Conservatives who worked on this campaign are as surprised by the result as the pollsters, pundits, politicians and general population.Maybe they shouldn't be - the economy is in good shape and the Conservatives had incumbency advantage.But when I travelled back from the prime minister's last rally with a group of exhausted Conservative campaign officials it was clear that 290 seats was a hoped-for target.No-one talked about anything over 300 seats, and no-one even mentioned an overall majority.So what special sauce pushed David Cameron into No 10 with a Commons majority?Mr Cameron had two simple messages in the campaign and he rarely veered away from them; the first - the economy is in good shape and the recovery is threatened by Labour. And the second - the SNP would hold a Labour-led government to ransom.Read more from Jonny Dymond hereBrian Taylor, BBC political editor, ScotlandOf all the comments on the overnight apocalypse, undoubtedly the most straightforward came from a defeated Scottish Labour MP.Since there were quite a few of them, let me narrow the focus a little. Come on down, Tom Harris.Mr Harris had plainly anticipated defeat. Nonetheless, he looked suitably lugubrious as his fate was confirmed.Why, he was asked eagerly, had Labour lost? ""Because we did not win enough votes.""Psephologically, it is perfect. Complete in itself. Psychologically, it sums up Labour's gloom without descending into subsidiary matters such as leadership, strategy and the rest. As a forward-thinking strategy, it is ideal. Win more votes. Simple.Read more from Brian Taylor hereThis has been an election which may have more profound consequences than almost any in living memory.We now face a generational decision about our future in Europe, with an EU referendum in two years' time almost certain.There will also be serious questions about the future of the Union, following an SNP landslide that has turned Scotland into a virtual one-party state.David Cameron's victory also represents a colossal achievement.Only once before in recent history has an incumbent government increased its majority - and that was Mrs Thatcher in her prime in the 1980s.It is also a significant personal victory for Mr Cameron and a rebuff for those in his party who had become increasingly sceptical about his ability to win.But while it may represent a defeat for those Tories who saw this election as a potential opportunity to rid themselves of David Cameron, he must now govern with a wafer-thin majority.For the SNP, their stunning victory can only increase the pressure on Nicola Sturgeon to include a commitment to a second independence referendum in her party's manifesto for next year's Scottish elections.It is an election which has not just defied all the predictions of the pollsters and pundits - but which may yet prompt the most fundamental re-casting of British politics for a generation.Read more from Norman Smith hereAfter an extraordinary night, some brief conclusions:Read more from James Landale hereIs this the end of the union?That is the question many people will be asking this morning after the party which has fought for Scottish independence for 80 years swept to victory.The answer from the jubilant Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon is a firm ""No"".She insists that her MPs will speak for all of Scotland, not just for the 45% who voted for the country to leave the United Kingdom last September.In the closing hours of the most extraordinary election campaign which anyone in Scotland can remember, Ms Sturgeon turned to talk of ""legitimacy.""That will be her watchword in the coming days as she argues that the prime minister cannot ignore the democratic will of the Scottish people.Politically, Scotland and England this morning look and feel like very different countries.Read more from James Cook hereAfter weeks of chatter about an election too close to call, it wasn't that close at all.David Cameron will be continuing as our prime minister.So, what is all this likely to mean?A referendum on whether the UK stays in, or leaves, the European Union, within the next two-and-a-half years.A race to be the next leader of the Labour Party.A race to be the next leader of the Liberal Democrats.And a huge new presence of Scottish National Party MPs at Westminster.And so here's another thing we know for certain this morning: Politics ain't going to be boring any time soon.Read more from Chris Mason hereFor Labour the story of their terrible night is rapidly turning into the search for a new leader. So who will that be?Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, is almost certain to run.  Even before this election, both he and another almost inevitable candidate, Chuka Umunna, had raised eyebrows inside the party at the work they had put in, preparing the ground with members and the unions for potential bids.Yvette Cooper, before the election, was still thought not to have made up her mind over whether to run. That decision has been made perhaps a little easier as her husband, Ed Balls, has lost his seat.She is certainly potentially in the frame, along with two lesser known names - Liz Kendall and Dan Jarvis - two MPs who were only elected in 2010 for the first time. This could be their moment. But whoever is in the job, they face a monumental task.Read Laura Kuenssberg's Twitter hereSterling is up (the most for seven years against the euro), share prices are up (especially bank shares like Lloyds and RBS, and energy shares such as Centrica), government bond prices are up.To state the obvious, investors love the Tories' general election victory.There are a few reasons.One (no surprise here) is that Labour's threat of breaking up banks and imposing energy price caps has been lifted.Second is that investors have been discounting days and weeks of wrangling after polling day over who would form the government - and so they are semi-euphoric that we already know who's in charge.Third, many investors tend to be economically conservative and instinctively Conservative.But although the City may be a bit drunk on the result, its pleasure in Ed Miliband's and Ed Balls' humiliation may be making it a bit blind - perhaps dangerously so - to some bumps in the economic road ahead.Read more from Robert Peston hereNigel Farage dreamed of holding the balance of power, but in the end his UKIP party is now worse off than when it came into the election.At the seventh time of asking he was rejected - this time by the people of Thanet South. It was a similar story in Rochester and Strood where Mark Reckless, who sensationally defected from the Tories last year, was also sent packing.In seats on UKIP's target list, like Thurrock in Essex, the party failed to make gains. In Grimsby - where Mr Farage went twice in the last six weeks - they came third.UKIP got around four million votes - with especially strong showings in north-east and south-east England - but it's ended up with just one MP, and a vacancy at the top. This has led to UKIP attacking the current system of choosing MPs, which it's described as ""busted"" and ""dysfunctional"".In one sense, this campaign was a complete failure and it's left an aftermath of angry voters, and others wondering if the UKIP bubble has burst.Read Robin Brant's Twitter hereI monitored 91 GB-wide voting intention polls during the 2015 election campaign and found nothing in them to prepare me for the final outcome.The good news for the pollsters was that their share for the Lib Dems was pretty close, as were the shares for UKIP, the Greens and the catch-all category of Others.The bad news for the polling industry was that the crucial shares for Conservative and Labour were the ones where they came most adrift.When all the qualifications of margins of error are allowed, there did appear to be a systematic overstatement of the Labour share and an equally systematic understatement of the Conservative one.It is for the pollsters to decide whether to conduct a review of their performance but I trust they will avoid the initial knee-jerk reaction of the immediate aftermath of the 1992 polls debacle.This general election performance follows the performance of the polls in the 2014 Scottish referendum where the choice was simply binary and yet all the polls were out by between 4-6%.Something is wrong. A lot of us would like to know what it is.Read more from David Cowling hereThe words ""political earthquake"" have been translated into numerous European languages, making front page news across the continent.While Britons now examine the domestic minutiae of the election result, here in mainland Europe the vote means one thing: a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU. And that has the potential to create an earthquake of its own.The guardian of the EU treaties Mr Cameron wants to change - Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker - has said again he'd listen to what Britain's new government proposed.Read more from Katya Adler here"

2015-05-17,A history of political plots,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32749971,"Nigel Farage has apparently seen off a challenge to his leadership of UKIP - a move described by his former election strategist as a ""coup"". He's not the only party leader to face an attempted ousting. But can you recover from such a revolt?In 2006, the Labour prime minister was the target of what became known as the ""curry house conspiracy"" - a coup to remove him and install his chancellor, Gordon Brown, as prime minister.It would lead to several of the plotters' resignations - but not Mr Blair's. However, it was successful to a degree in that it forced the party leader into naming a departure date.The move against him was reportedly masterminded by Tom Watson, a defence minister at the time, who was also rumoured to have had a secret meeting with Mr Brown on the eve of the revolt.Apparently, Mr Watson and three fellow West Midlands MPs - Sion Simon, David Wright (both ministerial aides) and Khalid Mahmood - met over a biryani at a Wolverhampton curry house to discuss the PM's future, before dispatching a missive calling for him to quit.The letter - which attracted the support of a number of normally loyal Labour MPs - was leaked to the press, and ultimately resulted in Mr Watson's resignation.In his parting letter, the West Bromwich East MP took a shot at the prime minister, who he said should step down in the interests of party and country.Mr Blair denounced his actions and branded the former minister ""disloyal, discourteous and wrong"", saying he would have sacked him if he had not resigned.But Mr Watson's departure was swiftly followed by the resignations of six other junior members of government - who had also signed the rebel letter - in protest at the prime minister's refusal to say when he would step down as Labour leader.The whole affair resulted in Mr Blair announcing his intention to step aside within 12 months - which he duly did, on 27 June 2007.But it did nothing to quash internal dissent and speculation in the party over the future leadership of the party.Labour prime minister Gordon Brown found his leadership under threat in 2009 after one of his cabinet ministers dramatically quit the government and called for him to resign.Work and Pensions Secretary James Purnell - a former aide to Tony Blair - resigned from his post after the polls closed in the local and European elections, in which Labour was forecast to do badly.Explaining his decision to quit, Mr Purnell said the prime minister made a Conservative victory ""more, not less, likely"".It was Mr Brown's first direct challenge from a cabinet minister - but it would not topple the Labour leader as senior members of government refused to follow Mr Purnell's lead.Mr Brown was safe for the time being. But several months later, in January 2010, a fresh leadership challenge was mounted by two senior former Labour cabinet ministers.Geoff Hoon and Patricia Hewitt wrote to all Labour MPs, saying the party was ""deeply divided"" over Mr Brown's leadership and that the best way to resolve the issue was by way of secret ballot.They insisted it was not an ""attempted coup"" but a necessary step to resolve divisions within the party.But the duo could only muster the public support of a handful of backbenchers long-opposed to Mr Brown, with the majority of the party's MPs less than impressed by the move, which came just weeks before the general election.As the day wore on, a succession of cabinet ministers came out to back the PM, suggesting there was little momentum behind the plot - although it was noted that several were not exactly gushing in their support of Mr Brown.As history tells us, neither leadership challenge bore fruit but they reflected the internal doubts and divisions over Mr Brown at the helm.As leadership toppling attempts go, this one in 2014 was regarded as a particularly ""botched"" and ""shambolic coup"". Indeed, former Lib Dem leader Lord (Paddy) Ashdown described the move as a ""plot of deep malice"".Its instigator, Lord (Matthew) Oakeshott - a close ally of the-then Business Secretary Vince Cable - tried to unseat Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg.The peer was found to have commissioned secret polls suggesting the party would do better at the 2015 general election without Mr Clegg in the driving seat.The man Lord Oakeshott had long had in mind to take Mr Clegg's place - Mr Cable, who was on government business in China at the time - was forced to publicly condemn his friend's actions and state his backing for Mr Clegg.But Lord Oakeshott said the business secretary had in fact known about his polls and their findings.Nevertheless, the peer - who was denounced by the Lib Dem leadership for spending money that could have been spent on campaigning - quit the party, and issued a warning shot on his way out about the Lib Dems' future prospects.Mr Cable largely emerged unscathed but he faced questions about his loyalty to the leader. Although the two sought to put paid to reports of a rift with a (painfully awkward, 'nothing to see here, folks') stage-managed pint in a pub.Although the revolt failed, and Mr Clegg remained at the helm, the Lib Dems did go on to suffer a trouncing at the general election, losing nearly 50 of its MPs - one of them, Mr Cable himself - prompting his leader to quit.The Conservatives have a reputation for being more ruthless than their party rivals when it comes to getting rid of leaders they sense are no longer effectual.But, in 1995, Prime Minister John Major - tired of persistent rumours of a leadership challenge - decided to take the bull by the horns and trigger a surprise leadership election to silence his detractors.His own backbenchers had questioned Mr Major's ability to unite and lead the party, which was deeply divided over Europe.So ""put up or shut up"", he told them as he tendered his resignation as Conservative Party leader but not prime minister.But then stepped forward eurosceptic MP John Redwood, who resigned from the cabinet in order to contest Mr Major's leadership.This was unexpected by many, as the PM had said there had been assurances from his cabinet that none would stand against him.But Mr Major went on to win the ensuing election with a comfortable defeat over his challenger, who was not included in the PM's consequent cabinet reshuffle.No further contested leadership election took place until after the Conservatives' defeat at the 1997 general election, paving the way for William Hague to take over the running of the party.Not all attempts to oust a party leader end in failure: as Margaret Thatcher found out to her peril.With three electoral victories under her belt, the Conservative prime minister's downfall would come at the hands of her own party - not the voters.It was on 1 November 1990 when Geoffrey (now Lord) Howe - one of Mrs Thatcher's longest-serving ministers - resigned over differences with the party leader over Europe.In his now infamous speech on the floor of the House of Commons, he attacked the PM's policies and leadership style, comparing being one of her cabinet ministers to opening the batting at cricket only to find his bat had been ""broken... by the team captain"".It sparked the beginning of the end of the 11-year Thatcher reign.Michael (now Lord) Heseltine seized on the opportunity to challenge the prime minister in the ensuing leadership contest, from which she would eventually withdraw and John Major emerge as her successor. Reflecting on the revolt and its implications on the Conservative Party, Baroness Thatcher's biographer Charles Moore wrote: ""Because the coup was unjustified, and so trust broke down, the politics of the next 15 years were those of civil war."""
2015-05-17,Election swings and roundabouts,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-32741924,"If election manifesto claims are all about smoke and mirrors, should we now add swings and roundabouts to the political metaphor?There's an intriguing aspect to the general election results in the Midlands that puzzled me.It's the striking contrast in the swings between Labour and the Conservatives.David Cameron and his campaign strategists knew they were home and dry when Nuneaton was the first Midlands marginal to declare.It was not only a Tory hold but a swing to the Conservatives from Labour of 3%.I was in the Nottingham suburb of Beeston awaiting the result of the Broxtowe count. Would its high profile Conservative MP Anna Soubry survive a red surge?Nuneaton set the pattern. Across the Midlands, both east and west, there was a uniform swing of between three and four per cent to the Tories - Warwickshire North 3%, Amber Valley 4%, Derbyshire South 4% and Sherwood 4%. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan topped the Tory swingometer in the Midlands marginals with 5% in Loughborough.Yet in the big cities, it was a very different story. The swing went to Labour.So in Nottingham East they enjoyed a 6% swing, Nottingham South 5.8%, Leicester South 7.3%, Leicester West 5%, Birmingham Hall Green 12%, Birmingham Hodge Hill 8%.If swings to Labour on this scale had gone beyond the city ring road roundabouts and into the suburbs, Ed Miliband would have become prime minister by now.In confidence, one senior Labour insider in Nottingham told me its success in the city wards was down to organisation, experience and its teams of activists.""We won the ground war. If Nottingham's city boundaries were extended into Sherwood and Broxtowe, we would have won those constituencies as well,"" he told me.Labour leadership candidate, Leicester West's Liz Kendall has identified her party's problem beyond the ring road roundabout.It's about reaching out to Middle England.""We need to show people that we understand their aspirations and ambitions for the future,"" she told the Sunday Times.The problem for Labour was that Middle England was not interested in what the party offered…and still isn't. The Cameron brand worked its magic in those Midlands marginals... it'll take something or someone special to break up that ballot box relationship."
2015-05-17,Royal 'lobbying',https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32740154,"Prince Charles sent 27 letters to then Prime Minister Tony Blair and members of his government between September 2004 and March 2005, ""despite the Freedom of Information Act!"" as the prince joked in one.But did his suggestions and concerns have any bearing on the behaviour of Mr Blair's government?The request: Prince Charles expresses his worries over an EU directive on complementary medicines ""which is… effectively outlawing the use of certain herbal extracts"".  Mr Blair replied, offering moral support and practical help. He agreed that ""the implementation as it is currently planned is crazy"" and set out an action plan that included delaying implementation for all existing products to 2011. What happened: Herbal products were not required to be authorised until 2011, just as Mr Blair had promised. Prince Charles continues to sell his own brand of complementary products, Duchy Herbals, through Boots and Waitrose. The request: Writing to Mr Blair, the prince expresses a ""growing sense of anxiety"" that the Hill Farming Allowance, which supports farmers working on Britain's uplands, could be scrapped. In his reply, the prime minister said he understood that the Hill Farm Allowance would continue until 2007. What happened: The allowance lasted until the end of Labour's tenure in 2010, when it was abolished.The request: Just 18 months after the US-led invasion of Iraq, Prince Charles raised the issue of poor performance of Lynx helicopters in high temperatures, saying: ""I fear that this is just one more example of where our Armed Forces are being asked to do an extremely challenging job (particularly in Iraq) without the necessary resources.""Mr Blair replied: ""On the subject of the Lynx helicopter, the limitations of the existing platform, particularly in the extremely challenging environment within Iraq, are well recognised by the Ministry of Defence."" He added that replacement of the helicopters would be a priority. What happened: Mr Blair's comments go much further than what he was saying about the subject at the time. In the event, though, the fleet was not fully upgraded until 2011.The request: Prince Charles lamented that the government's TB prevention plans might not ""include a commitment to deal with the badger problem in the immediate future"" and pushed strongly for a cull, saying: ""All I can say is that I do urge you to look again at introducing a proper cull of badgers where it is necessary.""Mr Blair sympathised, saying he could ""personally see the case for culling badgers"". However, he was unwilling to commit to a cull.  What happened: Culling trials were conducted from 1998-2005. The final results, published in 2008, said that the badger cull could ""make no meaningful contribution"" to curbing bovine TB. It wasn't until 2013 that a full culling programme began in two pilot areas. These ended with the conclusion that the pilots had been neither humane nor effective at curbing the spread of TB.The request: Then Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell wrote to Prince Charles to say she had decided to give parts of the historic Smithfield meat market Grade II listed status, and was trying to persuade deputy prime minister John Prescott to ""call in"" the planning application to prevent demolition of other parts of the site. She had been swayed by evidence provided by Sir Neil Cossons, who was English Heritage chair at the time, after he had been asked by the prince to add his support. Prince Charles replied that he was ""extremely glad to read of your appreciation of the value of this group of buildings"". According to the Guardian, market workers desperate to see the redevelopment of the site invited the prince to meet them to discuss it, but his office said he was ""unlikely to accept as he did not want to interfere in the planning process"".What happened: Smithfield market is still the subject of planning battles a decade on. Successive planning applications have been refused by ministers. Last year then Communities Secretary Eric Pickles rejected plans for an office development on the site, stating that ""the extent of damage that the application would cause to the important heritage assets at Smithfield runs entirely counter to national and policy objectives intended to protect such assets from harm"".In March, the Museum of London announced a move from its current Barbican site to the Smithfield market building."
2015-05-17,Election fallout,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32703139,"""Some of those gimmicks - that tombstone, whatever idiot thought that up I do not know!""I was talking to the former Mayor of Crawley in Sussex, John Mortimer, in the town's Labour Supporters Club about the vexed question of what went wrong, and where Labour should go next. This seat is one of those southern seats Labour hoped to take, but failed.I hear a whole range of views in the club.""They didn't give nothing to depend on, they should be clear, and a little bit more down to Earth."" ""Good party, wrong leader, they don't look after business enough.""Councillor John Stanley tells me: ""I think in a way we did go too left, but now we can go a bit centre-left, or centre, depending who the new leader is.""The former mayor sums up the mood on the doorstep: ""Whatever we told them, they didn't believe us.""  Expect to hear all those views, and more, in the coming leadership contest. Step back from the angst of supporters, and it may not be that hard to see why Labour failed.  An economic recovery, hailed by independent organisations as the result of government policy, undid a party that had loudly proclaimed for five years that the coalition's policies would lead to economic disaster. Combine that with an uncharismatic and uninspirational leader, then you might argue no further debate is necessary.Fat chance of that. Defeat breeds resentment, and this one has opened up old divisions.  A chorus of Blairties, led by the man himself, has declared that Ed's problem was ignoring those with aspiration and ambition, failing to appeal to those running business. Incidentally, I've been ticked off by the perspicacious editor of the New Statesman, Jason Cowley, for using the ""unhelpful"" term ""Blairites"".I can't think of another description that fits Tony, Lord Mandelson, Lord Adonis and David Miliband quite so well. But call them what you will, the message was clear - Ed was too left wing, Labour should move back to the centre, or, if you like, to the right.Reading Mr Blair's pithy analysis, listening to Lord Mandelson's gripping and savage eloquence, describing a party sent out to shout: ""We love the poor and hate the rich,"" and so ignoring the middle, and you realise strong emotions are in play.But back to the future may not be sufficient. Of course elections are won on the centre ground. But grandees grinding axes, affronted by the failure of boys who used to make their tea, may be creating so much noise that they can't hear more insistent sounds.  For there are several elephants trumpeting loudly as they cram into the small space of the shadow cabinet room. Imagine these beasts are as gaily decorated as Berlin buddy bears. One is decked out in red, another in imperial purple bunting, and another, a mammoth, strong tusked and ice rimmed, painted yellow with tartan trimmings.Take the last first. The Scottish wipeout is Labour's biggest problem. Fail to solve it, and Labour can forget ever having a comfortable majority again. It is hard to argue Labour were wiped out in Scotland because the SNP outflanked them to the right with their appeal to the business community and the ambitious and aspirational. But it is true the SNP drew in to people from left, right and centre, just as the modernisers say Labour should. It was the politics of economic self-interest, but cast in a very different light. Tribally sneering at ""the reactionary ideology of nationalism"" as Mr Blair does, will not reach the central belt of Scotland, the middle ground of  Midlothian.What about that purple pachyderm?  In Crawley - in fact in seat after seat - there is a similar pattern.  Labour did, in fact, often increase the size of their vote. So did the Conservatives, usually by a bit more. But the real dynamic was the total collapse of the Lib Dems and the dramatic rise of UKIP. The increase in votes for Nigel Farage's party wasn't translated into parliamentary seats, but, although it is early days in terms of research, it probably hurt Labour a lot. If we believe - and I do - Matthew Goodwin and Rob Ford, authors of Revolt on the Right, these voters are often former Labour supporters - older, less educated, those left behind on the tides of  globalisation, stranded on the shores of post-industrialisation. They may have had too many disappointments to feel much ambition or aspiration. They are a challenge for Labour, and any new leader will spend a good deal of time thinking how to deal with the concerns of Europe and immigration.Whether to share their fears, or confront them will be a big decision.Which brings us to Red Nellie. Those members who still proudly call themselves socialist. This is not about Old Labour - they are more likely to be baristas or barristers than boilermakers. It is easy as an outsider, as a journalist, to treat politics as an intellectual game about how best to win power - but many people, particularly the foot soldiers, particularly after the death of  purely tribal loyalties, are in it because they passionately believe in winning  power to do something specific.Many of them are suspicious of the later incarnations of New Labour, not because it reached an accommodation with wealth and business, but because it seemed to worship at the same altar, to regard the party's core beliefs in redistribution and equality as childish fantasies from a past age.Perhaps to Mr Blair, they are the problem, people who may equate ""ambition"" with greed. They might point out that a man who claims to be worth ""only"" £20m may find it harder than most to squeeze through the eye of a needle to understand their point of view. Most successful Labour leaders will confront the left at some point, but the concerns of this group go to the existential question ""What is the party for?""This is not a polemic - not an argument about what should be done, but a reflection on the complex conundrums that will face any new Labour leader, the tearing apart of the old alliance that made up a Labour majority, and so the political need to satisfy groups with very different, indeed, contradictory demands. But looking for a Social Democratic universal theory of everything may be missing the point. What the party desperately wants is a leader who can pull the disparate threads together and articulate them as common purpose. Whether she or he exists is another matter.Much more on that in the coming months."
2015-05-17,'Take us with you',https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-32736153,"Thousands of people in the north of England have been using the hashtag ""take us with you Scotland"" to express their upset about the result of last week's general election, and Scottish nationalists are welcoming this English minority with open arms. Last Thursday's general election was a rough one for the Labour Party in its traditional stronghold in the north of England. But further to the north, the left-leaning Scottish National Party won nearly every seat it contested. That political contrast has made some left-wing voters in places like Manchester, Leeds and Sheffield look fondly on their neighbours. Since last Thursday's election in Britain the phrase ""take us with you Scotland"" has been used more than 24,000 times. ""Genuinely beginning to wonder if the North of England becoming a part of Scotland would be better for us, I really am,"" tweeted Aaron Miller from Yorkshire. Some cracked jokes under the tag after the North West Motorway Police account, which gives traffic updates, announced that they had ""picked up a pedestrian on the M62 who was trying to walk to Scotland.""After an initial spike of jokes over the weekend, the hashtag really took off when users start to mobilise in support of around a year-old petition on the campaigning site Change.org. The petition calls for the north of England to secede from the rest of the country and join up with Scotland, and more than 12,000 people have signed it.Its creator, a Sheffield resident who calls himself ""Stu Dent"", set it up to coincide with last year's Scottish independence referendum, and he also created a map imagining the boundary of a ""Scotland plus the north"" country.Stu Dent runs the Twitter account Hunters Bar, named after an area of southwest Sheffield which is very popular with - you guessed it - students. Despite the account having thousands of followers on Twitter, when the map was first posted last year, the image was shared only about 100 times - however, in the past week it's been retweeted by thousands. Stu Dent told BBC Trending that he was surprised at how popular his idea has become. ""In hindsight, perhaps I shouldn't have been,"" he said. ""There is a huge frustration in parts of the UK about the things that have happened since 2010.""""I think people need a place to go where they can say 'not in my name! This is not the England I want',"" he added. But in addition to disappointment from some quarters about the election result, there might be another reason why the petition is getting a boost now: the power of the Scottish Nationalists on Twitter. What started as a post-election joke in the North of England was quickly embraced by the so-called ""Cyber Nats"" - and a trend was born.The SNP's social media strategist Ross Colquhoun expressed the party's mood about the hashtag best, in a post which was shared more than 500 times. ""2014: #LetsStayTogether 2015: #TakeUsWithYouScotland What a difference a year makes"" he tweeted.Blog by Hannah HendersonNext story: The sport reporter and the obscene ranter who lost his jobFollow BBC Trending on Twitter @BBCtrending, and find us on Facebook."
2015-05-17,What Britain wants from Europe,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32695399,"David Cameron says he has a mandate to pursue EU reform following the Conservatives' general election victory. The PM, who will be hoping his majority government will give him extra leverage in Brussels, wants to renegotiate the terms of the UK's membership ahead of a referendum by the end of 2017. He has said he will campaign for Britain to remain in the EU if he gets the reforms he wants.Mr Cameron has said he does not want to reveal full details of his negotiating hand but he has given a broad indication, in a series of speeches and newspaper articles, of his priorities when he goes into talks with other EU leaders.These are: The prime minister has said Britain would resist any move towards a European Army and that he wants to free British police forces from EU interference. He has also ruled out Britain joining the euro.But he has placed less emphasis in recent years on demanding changes to EU social policy, such as the maximum 48-hour working week, agency workers, maternity leave and non-discrimination rules.The official UK government position is that a referendum will be held by the end of 2017 but Downing Street sources have said: ""If we can do it earlier we will.""There is speculation David Cameron is planning to hold the vote in 2016 to avoid a clash with French and German elections in 2017.The prime minister wants treaty change but even if the referendum was held in 2017 there may not be enough time to legally incorporate any reforms into a treaty and it would have to be done at a later stage.An early referendum would anger Eurosceptics who believe it would not allow enough time to make the case for exit or negotiate any meaningful concessions.""A rushed process would severely undermine the chances to secure a significant deal that both British business and voters could support and would waste the opportunity of a lifetime,"" Matthew Elliott, chief executive of Business for Britain told Breitbart London.The question is always crucial in any referendum and there is already a debate about what it should be. The Draft European Union (Referendum) Bill, published by the Conservatives in 2013, proposed this form of words: ""Do you think that the United Kingdom should remain a member of the European Union?""Some thought that leaned too far towards the status quo, encouraging a yes vote, and the Electoral Commission said it was not clear and direct enough. The watchdog proposed this form of words instead: ""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union?""The new Conservative government will attempt to repeal the Human Rights Act, which requires UK courts to treat the European Court of Human Rights as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. The European Court of Human Rights is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe (CoE), which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine.The freedom for people to move around Europe, enshrined in the EU treaties, works in parallel with the other three basic freedoms in the single market: freedom of goods, capital and services.It is likely to be a ""red line"" for other EU leaders, who do not want to see it eroded.Mr Cameron has steered clear of tackling it directly - for example by asking for an emergency ""brake"" on free movement, or a cap on numbers - focusing instead on reducing the incentive provided by welfare payments. In a speech last November, David Cameron set out measures to reduce the number of EU nationals moving to the UK.His main proposals were:Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission, has said he is ready to work with Mr Cameron to ""strike a fair deal for the United Kingdom in the EU"". The leaders of other EU nations have previously warned they are unlikely to support major changes to EU treaties to accommodate British demands. But Mr Cameron's general election victory may have given him extra leverage. ""The ball is very much in the court of the UK now,"" a senior EU official told The Guardian. ""It's up to the British to define what they want."" The key figure will be German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is very keen to keep Britain in the EU but has so far been unwilling to make major concessions to enable that to happen. There are fears that a ""pick and mix"" approach to EU treaties would undermine EU cohesion.Mr Cameron has said there is ""no doubt"" his planned reforms will require changes to the treaties governing the European Union. But this would require the unanimous support of all EU members, and may not be possible within the deadline he has set of a referendum before the end of 2017. Any attempt to change EU laws on free movement would meet fierce resistance from some EU nations, particularly Eastern European states. Mr Juncker has said free movement is non-negotiable.Mr Cameron may find it difficult to get unanimous support for his proposals for a four-year waiting period for migrant workers claiming UK benefits. East European EU members would be likely to oppose this, on the grounds that it would discriminate against their citizens.  Attempts to secure opt-outs for the City are unlikely to go down well with other European leaders.However, there are precedents for EU treaty changes to accommodate some countries' specific concerns - for example, the protocol attached to the Lisbon Treaty for Ireland.Mr Cameron has faced repeated calls to say whether he would campaign for Britain's exit from the EU in the referendum if he fails to get what he wants from the renegotiation process. All he has said is that he will ""rule nothing out"". Some Conservative MPs want Britain to leave the EU no matter what David Cameron manages to renegotiate. A larger group are likely to want more concessions than Mr Cameron has so far indicated he is prepared to demand.Senior backbencher David Davis, who was defeated by Mr Cameron for the Tory leadership in 2005, told the Daily Telegraph the majority of the 332 Conservative MPs want Mr Cameron to negotiate an ""opt-out"" power to stop individual EU laws from applying to Britain. The prime minister has said this would be ""impossible"" without Britain leaving the EU.Mr Davis claims as many as 60 Tory MPs would be prepared to rebel and vote for Britain's exit from the EU if the prime minister fails to deliver.Graham Brady, chairman of the Tory backbench 1922 committee, which represents backbenchers, has urged David Cameron to give all Conservative MPs, including ministers, a free vote in the EU referendum.In January, Mr Cameron warned that serving cabinet ministers would have to quit the government if they wanted to campaign to leave the EU if he had secured the reforms to it he wants.In the 1975 referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Economic Community, as the EU was then called, Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson decided to suspend collective responsibility because his cabinet was split on the issue. Ministers were allowed to vote with their consciences and campaign against each other. The majority of them, including Mr Wilson, joined the Yes camp, but left-wingers, such as Tony Benn, played a leading role in the No campaign. The Yes campaign won easily with 67% of the vote."

2015-05-18,Scots Labour leader Murphy to resign,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32760196,"Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy is to resign next month, he has announced.It comes despite Mr Murphy narrowly surviving a vote of no confidence at a meeting of the party's national executive in Glasgow. Mr Murphy said he would tender his resignation alongside a plan to reform the party.He lost his seat in last week's general election as the SNP won 56 of the 59 Scottish seats, leaving Labour with a single MP in Scotland.Mr Murphy said he wanted to have a successor as leader in place by the summer, and confirmed he would not be standing for a seat at the Scottish Parliament in next year's election. Instead, he said it was time to ""do something else"" and that he believed the party would continue to be divided if he remained as leader. His deputy, Kezia Dugdale MSP, will become acting leader until a permanent successor is found. Mr Murphy had faced calls to resign from several MSPs, trade unions and former MPs in the wake of his party's near wipeout at the general election.He insisted he had decided to stand down ahead of the national executive voting by 17-14 in favour of him staying in the job.Speaking at a media conference after the national executive meeting, he said: ""It is clear that a small minority who didn't accept my election as leader of the Scottish Labour Party just five months ago won't accept the vote of the executive today and that will continue to divide the party.""Today I received more support in the executive vote than I did from members of the executive when I stood for election five months ago.""He said it would be up to the executive whether to accept the reforms he would be proposing before he left the post. But he warned: ""A party in such urgent need of reform blocks those changes at its peril.""The former East Renfrewshire MP said Labour had been crushed between ""two nationalisms"" in Scotland and England.Mr Murphy said he left no legacy of bitterness for anyone in the Labour Party, and the only person he was angry at was the person who blamed Scottish Labour for the party's UK-wide general election defeat - a reference to Unite leader Len McCluskey.And he said that in many ways Scottish Labour was the ""least modernised part of the Labour movement"" and that he wanted his successor to be elected under a one member, one vote system.Mr Murphy added: ""The Labour Party's problem is not the link with trade unions, or even the relationship with Unite members - far from it. It is the destructive behaviour of one high profile trade unionist.""The leader of the Scottish Labour Party doesn't serve at the grace of Len McCluskey, and the next leader of the UK Labour Party should not be picked by Len McCluskey.""Mr McCluskey has been a vocal critic of Mr Murphy's leadership and opposed his appointment in December when Mr Murphy won the contest to replace Johann Lamont.Jim Murphy laughed and joked with Scottish Labour's sole MP as he made his way down the hotel corridor to announce his resignation.He certainly brought energy and dynamism to his election campaign - but all that achieved was Ian Murray in Edinburgh South.So as Mr Murphy bows out, who could replace him?The deputy leader Kezia Dugdale may want to step up or Neil Findlay could try again after challenging last time. Maybe the party's finance spokeswoman Jackie Baillie thinks her steady hand could steer the ship.Jenny Marra is also often talked about as future face of the party.Whoever steps into Jim Murphy's red shoes he or she will have to face a difficult 2016 Holyrood election, to put it mildly.There are also more fundamental questions about how the party can possibly move on as it faces a surging SNP.Mr Murphy was very much a creature of ""New Labour"" - but to today's generation that's old Labour.Party members may start looking for someone with no links to the past, neither a Brownite nor a Blairite. A 'cleanskin' - as the politicos put it - may well help re-connect with voters.That's a long way from now though - even some of the party's opponents may view this latest train wreck with a modicum of sympathy. Ms Lamont had resigned after claiming Scottish Labour was treated like a ""branch office"" by the London-based party leadership.Mr Murphy concluded his speech by saying: ""Scotland needs a strong Labour party; Scotland needs a united Labour party. We have been the greatest force for change in our nation's remarkable history. ""The Scottish Labour party will rise again. It will be under someone else's leadership and I am confident about my party's future.""Harriet Harman MP, acting leader of the UK Labour Party, said it would be for Scottish Labour to choose a new leader. She added: ""As a cabinet minister and leader of his party in Scotland, Jim has been a hugely important figure in the Labour Party. He leaves with the best wishes and thanks of our movement.""Labour peer Lord McConnell, a former Scottish first minister, said the party's problems were ""much deeper than one individual and one affiliate"".He said: ""We have a disconnect locally and nationally with wider Scottish society. ""We have a problem with our political positioning in the post devolution age where the party particularly at the UK level has never been comfortable with success in the Scottish parliament and has always tried to see things through a UK prism rather than a Scottish prism.""We need to find a new generation, a new leader, new generation, new ideas, a fresh approach.""In a tweet, Scottish first minister and SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said: ""I wish Jim Murphy all the very best for the future. Leadership is not easy and he deserves credit for standing up for what he believes in.""Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson also reacted on Twitter, saying: ""Jim Murphy announces a managed exit in order to help the party, which is to his credit. But leaves a tough gig for whoever comes next.""The meeting of Scottish Labour's executive was disrupted by protesters who entered the party's headquarters.Police were called and the protesters, who included persistent anti-austerity activists Sean Clerkin and Piers Doughty-Brown, left the building to protest further from the street outside.The protesters were calling for Mr Murphy to remain as leader to ""finish the job of destroying Scottish Labour"".A Police Scotland spokeswoman said officers had been called and found two protestors on the third floor of the building. She added: ""Both left on police arrival. Advice and assistance was given."""
2015-05-18,Labour contenders clash on spending,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32761561,"Prospective Labour leaders have clashed over Labour's record in government in their first public debate in the race to succeed Ed Miliband.Former cabinet ministers including Yvette Cooper and Andy Burnham defended Labour's fiscal record and spending on schools and hospitals.However, candidates from the 2010 intake of MPs argued that the party spent too much while in office.The debate followed Chuka Umunna's withdrawal from the leadership contest.The remaining candidates appeared at the annual conference of the Progress think tank in London.There was agreement that Labour needed to demonstrate economic credibility to regain power, with shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt telling the meeting that the party needed to be ""trusted with public finances and the family finances"".Mr Hunt, who was first elected to Parliament in 2010 when Labour lost power, argued the last Labour government ""spent too much"" and failed to ""leave enough economic headroom to deal with the economic crisis and the recession"".Shadow health minister Liz Kendall said: ""There's absolutely nothing progressive about spending more on debt interest payments than on educating our children.""But shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: ""The Tories have had a triumph of spin over the facts in saying what they said about the economic record of the last Labour government.""The former chief secretary to the Treasury said the deficit did ""grow too large"" in the government's later years but insisted: ""The last Labour government ran more surpluses in its first term than the Tories did in 18 years.""Yvette Cooper, another former chief secretary to the Treasury, said: ""We should never let anybody tell us that it was too many teachers, doctors or nurses that caused Lehman Brothers bank in New York to crash.""Shadow international development secretary Mary Creagh said: ""People have forgotten the economic credibility that the last Labour government had.""She said Labour had built schools and hospitals that were ""treasured in our communities"".Ms Cooper, Mr Burnham, Ms Kendall and Ms Creagh have declared their intention to run for leader, while Mr Hunt told the conference he would make an announcement next week.At the same event, shadow energy secretary Caroline Flint announced she would be running for deputy leader.The Don Valley MP told the Today programme ahead of the debate that Labour lost the election because ""fundamentally the public did not trust us on the economy"".Exeter MP Ben Bradshaw has already announced a bid to be deputy, saying Labour ""must and could win the next election"", but only if it ""broadens its appeal by adopting sensible, centre-left politics which celebrate wealth creation and entrepreneurship"".Former Labour campaign co-ordinator Tom Watson is reported to be crowd-funding a deputy leadership bid, while Walthamstow MP Stella Creasy has said she is ""open to the question"" of running.Barnsley East MP and shadow transport secretary Michael Dugher - a fierce critic of Ed Miliband's election campaign - is to run Mr Burnham's campaign, according to the website LabourList.It is reported that Mr Burnham also has the backing of Labour peer Lord Falconer, who was lord chancellor and justice secretary under Tony Blair and was close to the former PM.Shadow culture secretary Chris Bryant has signalled his backing for Ms Cooper, tweeting that the next leader must be ""someone who's been tried in the fiery furnace of public opinion"".Mr Hunt said on Friday he would be be attending the debate - along with the other four hopefuls - to ""set out my analysis on how we begin to understand what went so wrong and why"".He added: ""We must use this leadership election to ask some very profound questions.""All voices in the party must be heard so that we can have a full and proper assessment as to why the politics of nationalism triumphed in Scotland and huge swathes of England, and how we have allowed the Conservative Party to present a more compelling vision for Britain to so many millions of people.""Speculation still surrounds shadow business secretary Mr Umunna's decision to pull out on Friday, when he said he was not ""comfortable"" with the ""pressure"" of being a candidate.As well as citing extensive pressure and scrutiny Mr Umunna also said he was ruling himself out because of concerns about the impact of the bid on his family.A rising star of the party, Mr Umunna was first elected to Parliament in 2010 - alongside Tristram Hunt and Liz Kendall - before joining the shadow cabinet.Asked about the candidate who might win, Conservative Chancellor George Osborne said: ""The Labour leadership contest has descended into farce.""But it's not actually about personalities. I don't think the Labour Party any more represents the working people of this country who aspire to a better life."""

I'm not suggesting he takes a break from being leader.""Clearly the national executive has the authority, they're the ruling body. ""I'm told that they made a decision. I'm told it was a procedurally correct decision, he is the leader but I think it's important that as leader he takes a break and I think it's important that we work out how these complex questions are answered by a team.""No one person has all the answers. I'm particularly concerned about tone, making sure we get a tone that ensures that the 27 million people who didn't vote for UKIP last week may be persuaded to vote for us in future.""The party has been beset by wrangling since Mr Farage agreed to stay on as leader, days after standing down after failing to get elected in Thanet South.He had pledged before the general election that he would quit the post if he failed to get elected to Parliament.Senior aide Matthew Richardson has left the party, following claims from MEP Patrick O'Flynn that Mr Farage had fallen under the influence of ""inexperienced"" advisers.UKIP has also confirmed the departure of Mr Farage's chief of staff Raheem Kassam.Mr Farage ruled out quitting as leader on BBC's Question Time on Thursday, saying he had ""phenomenal"" support, and has challenged his critics to decide whether they want to stay in the party.In his article, Mr Carswell had said that ""knowing how difficult it is to lead a party makes me admire Nigel Farage all the more"".""I know that I never could,"" he added, stressing that he would find it ""impossible to simultaneously lead UKIP, be the voice of the party in the Commons, represent my Clacton constituents and at the same time be a husband and a dad"".However, he said that ""even leaders need to take a break"", adding: ""Nigel needs to take a break now.""UKIP got nearly four million votes at the election, but returned only one MP - former Conservative Mr Carswell in the Clacton constituency."

Under the plans, ministers could force schools rated as ""requiring improvement"" and missing new government benchmarks to become an academy.Coasting schools have average results which have often flatlined over time.Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, Mrs Morgan said faster action was needed.She said: ""Our big priorities will be to speed up the process for tackling failing schools; extend our academies programme to tackle 'coasting' schools; and deliver on our commitment to open new free schools.""The proposals will be in a new bill due to be introduced in the Queen's Speech. ""First, we will take new powers to step in from the moment that a school is found to be failing,"" Mrs Morgan said.""From day one, regional schools commissioners will be able to bring in new leadership and support from other excellent schools and heads, and we will speed up the process of turning schools into academies to make sure that new expert leadership is found for all schools that need it as quickly as possible.""She said that coasting schools will be put on an immediate notice to improve and could then be taken over and turned into an academy.They will be required to work with a team of ""expert"" head teachers.She said: ""Those that aren't able to demonstrate a clear plan for improvement will be given new leadership - we know this works in turning schools around.""More than 3,300 schools in England are labelled ""requires improvement"", but the plans are unlikely to cover that many schools.Under the current system, secondary schools are considered to be failing, and therefore eligible for intervention, if fewer than 40% of their students score at least five Cs at GCSE, including English and maths, and they do not meet national averages in pupil progress.In primary schools, the threshold for intervention is if fewer than 65% of pupils get Level 4 in reading, writing and maths and a below average number of pupils make the expected amount of progress.It is not yet clear how coasting schools will be deemed in need of intervention.It is understood that a new category will be devised covering schools which are rated as ""requires improvement"" and which fail to meet a new set of standards on improvement."
2015-05-18,Co-op Group to keep political funding,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-32762858,"The Co-operative Group has decided to continue financially supporting the Co-operative Party, which has strong ties to Labour.Members of the group, the UK's biggest mutual organisation, voted on the issue at their annual general meeting.They passed a motion by 48,579 for, to 39,479 against, to approve ""political expenditures"" of up to £1m which support the movement's objectives.Last year the Co-op Group gave £625,000 to the Co-op Party.This figure was down on the sums donated in previous years. The AGM also included a vote on new corporate governance procedures which would mean members having less of a direct say.The Co-operative Group is still recovering from a period of financial mismanagement and some members have recently expressed concerns about how elections to the board are chosen.The banking arm of the group came close to collapse in 2013, bringing the whole group to a £2.5bn annual loss that year. The Co-op Party includes among its members a number of Labour MPs, including shadow chancellor Chris Leslie and Walthamstow MP Stella Creasy. The politicians stand as candidates of both the Co-operative Party and the Labour Party, and the two political movements have strong historical ties. The board asked the members of the Co-operative Group whether they wanted to continue financially supporting the Co-operative Party, or any other party. Allan Leighton, chairman of the Co-op Group, said: ""There's a clear remit from the members to continue to support the Labour Party.""It allows us to now have a conversation with the Co-op Labour Party about what we do next.""There was also a members' motion on the agenda, put forward by those in favour of making political donations of up to £1m a year.The motion to approve political funding ""not to exceed £1m per annum"" was carried by 55.17% to 44.83%.BBC business correspondent Joe Lynam said: ""To meet a £1.5bn hole in its accounts - mostly stemming from its banking division - the Co-op Group has had to sell off parts of its businesses and hand over majority control of its bank to American hedge funds.""It's also in the process of radically changing the way it runs itself into a more corporate structure with less of a direct say by its members.""He said that ""in theory"", each of the 2.8 million Co-op members could vote on a series of motions about the reforms, as well as how its bosses are paid, and retaining the links to the Co-operative party.One of the group's largest independent societies, Midcounties, recently threatened legal action over a shortlist of six candidates for the group's board being reduced to three - the number of positions available - before a member vote.

2015-05-18,Osborne plans July 'stability' Budget,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32761566,"Chancellor George Osborne has said that he will deliver a new Budget on 8 July.He claimed it would have ""a laser-like focus"" on raising productivity and living standards.He said he was making the unusual move of having a second Budget in one year in order to ""deliver on the commitments we have made to working people"".Labour said the chancellor would have to set out ""who is going to pay"" for what it called ""uncosted promises"" in the election campaign.Speaking outside 11 Downing Street, the chancellor gave a broad outline of his plans for the forthcoming Budget but refused to be drawn on the details, including the Conservatives' planned £12bn of welfare cuts.""I don't want to wait to deliver on the commitments we have made to working people,"" he said.""It will continue with the balanced plan we have to deal with our debts, invest in our health service and reform welfare to make work pay.""But there will also be a laser-like focus on making our economy more productive so we raise living standards across our country.""We're going to put Britain into good shape for the long term.""The last Budget was held on 18 March and included tax cuts for first-time house buyers.Writing in the Sun, Mr Osborne admitted it was ""unusual"" to have two Budgets in the same year, but he wanted to turn ""promises made in the election into a reality"".Again, Mr Osborne did not specifically outline how the Conservatives plan to fulfil a pledge to cut £12bn in welfare spending but said he wants to make the welfare system ""fair for the people who pay for it"".He writes: ""We will protect the NHS and give it more funding each and every year, while making savings across Whitehall. ""We'll crack down hard on tax avoidance and aggressive tax planning by the rich - because everyone should pay their fair share.  ""We will always protect the most vulnerable, but we also need a welfare system that's fair to the people who pay for it. If you can work you should be working, so we'll take the next steps in our benefit reforms to make sure that happens.""Second, we've got to go on helping businesses create jobs in Britain, so we move towards full employment. That means facing a hard truth: in Britain we produce about a quarter less for every hour we work than countries like America or Germany. Fixing that long-running productivity weakness is the big challenge for the next five years.""So in the Budget we'll spend less on welfare, and instead invest to create three million more apprenticeships, so that young people can learn a trade, get better jobs and earn more.""After the Budget in March independent forecaster the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said that Mr Osborne needed to spell out exactly how he plans to cut £12bn from welfare spending.Of those £12bn planned cuts, £2bn were outlined ahead of the general election - all the cuts are supposed to be in place by 2017-18.Labour's shadow energy and climate change secretary, Caroline Flint, accused the Tories of making ""a number of uncosted promises"" during the election campaign.She told the BBC: ""It will be interesting to see who is going to pay for those uncosted policies when they bring the Budget in July."""
2015-05-18,Farage should take a break - Carswell,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32761766,"UKIP leader Nigel Farage ""needs to take a break now"", the party's only MP Douglas Carswell has said.Writing in the Times, Mr Carswell said he admired Mr Farage, but questioned his ""ill-advised"" comments about HIV patients, made in a TV leaders' debate.Mr Farage ruled out quitting as leader on BBC's Question Time on Thursday, saying he had ""phenomenal"" support.It follows a bitter internal row within the party, which has seen two of Mr Farage's senior aides resigning.In his article, Mr Carswell said that ""knowing how difficult it is to lead a party makes me admire Nigel Farage all the more"".""I know that I never could,"" he added, stressing that he would find it ""impossible to simultaneously lead UKIP, be the voice of the party in the Commons, represent my Clacton constituents and at the same time be a husband and a dad"".However, he said that ""even leaders need to take a break"", adding: ""Nigel needs to take a break now.""He described Mr Farage as ""inspirational"", saying the party had ""done extraordinarily well"" under his leadership but now needed to ""consider carefully what comes next"".Earlier, Mr Farage challenged his critics to decide whether they wanted him to stay in the party.He said he had ""massive"" support from UKIP MEPs, donors and party members to continue in the role, suggesting one person, whom he did not name, was ""agitating for change"".Addressing the prospect of a future EU referendum, Mr Carswell said: ""All of us UKIP supporters should ask one question; Is what I'm doing at this moment making an 'out' vote more likely? If it isn't, stop it and do something else.""He also criticised Mr Farage's comments about HIV patients during the TV leaders' debate last month.While debating about the NHS, Mr Farage said: ""You can come into Britain from anywhere in the world and get diagnosed with HIV and get the retro-viral drugs that cost up to £25,000 per year per patient.""Mr Carswell wrote: ""By all means we should highlight the problem of health tourism. But we need to admit that using the example of HIV patients to make the point was ill-advised.""He said the party needed to strike ""the right tone"" and added: ""UKIP has been at its most persuasive when we have been most optimistic.""Anger is never a great way to motivate people - at least not for very long.""The party has been beset by wrangling since Mr Farage agreed to stay on as leader, days after standing down after failing to get elected in Thanet South.He had pledged before the general election that he would quit the post if he failed to get elected to Parliament.Matthew Richardson has left the party, following claims from MEP Patrick O'Flynn that Mr Farage had fallen under the influence of ""inexperienced"" advisers. UKIP has also confirmed the departure of Mr Farage's chief of staff Raheem Kassam.UKIP got nearly four million votes at the election, but returned only one MP - former Conservative Mr Carswell in the Clacton constituency."

They absolutely loved how he helped them and he was a highly-regarded local MP,"" Mr Bone said.""He stood up for what was right rather than what the party line was. In those days - the John Major years - it was much more difficult to stand up against the party machine. He had strong views on Europe.""Sir Peter started his career as an insurance broker, joining the Wycombe Young Conservatives in 1949 and the Oxford University Conservative Association in 1951.He went on to become a Conservative councillor on Buckinghamshire County Council between 1961 and 1967.Wellingborough mayor-elect Barry Graves also paid tribute to Sir Peter, remembering him as a ""very strong constituency MP"".""I remember going out and canvassing with him and he would go everywhere. He knew the area and the people. He was very much a man of the local constituency.""He was ""a very approachable man"", Mr Graves added.Sir Peter was knighted in 1994. "

2015-05-18,PM will 'look at' powers proposals,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32746049,"David Cameron has said he would ""look at"" any proposals for further powers for Scotland but wants to get the Smith Commission plans implemented first.The prime minister was speaking after meeting Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon in Edinburgh.Mr Cameron said he made a ""commitment"" to include a devolution bill in the Queen's Speech later this month.Ms Sturgeon argued the Smith Commission proposals were ""a good starting point"" but did not go far enough.The prime minister has pledged to include a bill on devolution in this month's Queen's Speech which would be based on the cross-party Smith Commission agreement. The Smith proposals included giving Holyrood the power to set income tax rates and bands, as well as control over a share of VAT and some welfare benefits. But Ms Sturgeon's SNP also wants the Scottish Parliament to be given powers over business taxes, employment law, the minimum wage and additional powers over welfare.Speaking after meeting Ms Sturgeon, Mr Cameron told the BBC: ""Let's make sure Smith is implemented in full. I'm going to keep the commitment I made to the people of Scotland. Let's get that done first because it does create a really strong Scottish Parliament.""He added: ""Of course, if people want to make future proposals I'll look at them.""The prime minister again said he did not support full fiscal autonomy for Scotland - the responsibility for all areas of tax and spending except defence and foreign affairs - stating that it would mean £7bn of cuts or extra tax-raising.What Nicola Sturgeon is trying to say is she has a mandate. She has 56 out of the 59 MPs elected in Scotland and she won 50% of the vote - unprecedented here in Scotland.She says that gives her leverage to push David Cameron. David Cameron says he wants to keep the nation together.The language coming out of Westminster last week was very much a cordial one. 'We will listen'.Nicola Sturgeon has warned him that if he doesn't listen, then the people of Scotland will judge him accordingly.Ms  Sturgeon described the hour-long talks at her official residence at Bute House as ""constructive and business-like"". She said Mr Cameron had made a ""commitment"" that the Smith proposals would be implemented ""as agreed"".""But secondly the prime minister agreed that he would look at proposals that we would now send to suggest the areas we can go beyond Smith,"" Ms Sturgeon said.""There was no agreement in terms of the substance of that but we will submit those proposals, the prime minister has said they will consider them and there will be a meeting to look at how we take that further forward.""Referring to her party's success in last week's general election, which saw the SNP win 56 out of 59 Scottish seats, Ms Sturgeon said: ""People in Scotland have now voted fairly convincingly for the SNP and sent a message that we want the Smith Commission proposals to go further and be built on.""The ball is in his court but I'm going into this in good faith.""She added: ""David Cameron and I are a world apart politically but, where we can, I'm determined to do business in the interests of the people of Scotland and across the UK.""She said she would have a ""constructive and business-like"" relationship with the prime minister. The two leaders shook hands on the front steps of Bute House as Mr Cameron arrived. Mr Cameron left the building shortly before 11:00, almost an hour after he had arrived.The two sides agreed to hold more regular discussions in the future, possibly quarterly. "

I'm human, the rest of my life is more important to me than politics.""The shadow business secretary has been distressed by the degree of scrutiny he, his family and his girlfriend have come under since he declared his intention to stand for the labour leadership.I am told that this includes reporters waiting outside the houses of relatives late at night.Friends of Mr Umunna deny that he is nervous of not getting the support of enough MPs to run for the leadership; they point out that he already has half the necessary names and that there are some weeks to go.The shadow business secretary now wants to play a leading role in arguing that Britain should stay in the EU and does not rule out seeking the leadership in the future.He said he thought he had understood ""the scrutiny and attention a leadership contest would bring"", but added: ""However, since the night of our defeat last week I have been subject to the added level of pressure that comes with being a leadership candidate.""The shadow business secretary said he had wondered if it was too soon for him to stand for the leadership, and ""I fear it was."" He also cited concerns about the impact on ""the rest of one's life"" and those close to him.""Consequently, after further reflection, I am withdrawing my candidacy,"" he said.Mr Umunna said he would continue to serve as shadow business secretary and hoped to ""play a leading role"" in Labour's campaign to keep the UK in the EU during the forthcoming in/out referendum.Commenting on the news, Labour former culture secretary Ben Bradshaw - who is expected to run for deputy leader - said Mr Umunna was a ""terrible loss"" to the field.He told the BBC's Daily Politics the Streatham MP had been the candidate the Conservative Party ""feared the most"".""And if it's the result of pressure on an extended family or an extended group of friends, I think that's a very sad reflection on our political culture,"" he said.Chuka Umunna feels ""liberated"", he told me, by his decision to quit the Labour leadership race.He hopes to be given a good role (shadow chancellor, I wonder?) by whoever becomes Labour leader. And I expect he'll become very high profile in the campaign to keep Britain in Europe, which is increasingly looking like it will be next May.He'll endorse a candidate in the next four weeks before nominations close. It will be very interesting to see who he piles in behind.Read more from Allegra (see post 13.23).Former Labour leader Lord Kinnock said he thought Mr Umunna had made the right decision.He said: ""If he felt in his soul that he wasn't prepared to subject himself - and more importantly his family - to the kind of attention which is fairly typical, sadly, these days, he has done absolutely the right thing.""There is no point at all in inflicting avoidable, unnecessary misery on those you love most.""Leadership contender Mary Creagh said she had ""huge respect"" for Mr Umunna, telling BBC Radio 4's World at One programme it took ""courage"" to withdraw from the leadership race.Mr Umunna was ""a big beast"" and would play a ""big role"" in the future of the Labour Party, she added.Yvette Cooper, Andy Burnham, Liz Kendall and Mary Creagh have already thrown their hats into the ring for Labour's top job while a number of other potential candidates, including Dan Jarvis, Alan Johnson and David Lammy, have ruled themselves out. Candidates must secure nominations from 34 colleagues - 15% of the party's MPs - by 15 June to make it on to ballot papers, which will be sent to members in August ahead of the leader's election a month later."

However, Mr Justice Stuart Smith at Southwark Crown Court said there was a ""very strong likelihood"" a custodial sentence would follow.The jury heard how Mote submitted numerous false expenses claims for payment for work that organisations had allegedly carried out on his behalf.Mote claimed the money was to pay whistleblowers in cash through third parties. He also said he had been ""targeted for being an anti-EU MEP.""During his time an MEP he also made £250,000 legitimate expenses claims.No date has been set for the sentencing."

2015-05-18,Round-up: BBC experts' analysis,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/election-2015-32650417,"The political future of the United Kingdom has become clearer after the results of the general election emerged around the country.David Cameron says he hopes to govern for all of the UK after the Conservatives took 331 seats - enough to form a slender majority in the Commons.Labour has been all but wiped out by the SNP in Scotland and suffered a disappointing set of results elsewhere, while the Lib Dems are left with just eight MPs after many party heavyweights such as Vince Cable and Danny Alexander lost their seats.So with battles won and lost and the fall-out and celebrations beginning, BBC correspondents examine the implications and challenges that lie ahead for the new government - and for those whose political careers have been ended by voters.No pollster, no pundit, no political leader saw it coming - not even David Cameron himself.Governing parties don't gain seats. Parties that have implemented painful cuts and are promising more certainly don't. Until that is the Conservative Party did - achieving what had seemed to be Mission Impossible - a Tory majority.Until that is David Cameron's personal triumph which triggered the near simultaneous resignation of his three principle opponents - Messrs Miliband, Clegg and Farage.They did so in part because they helped to crush their partners in coalition these last five years - reducing the Liberal Democrat parliamentary party to a size when it can fit into two London taxis and still have two seats to spare.In part because the extraordinary tidal wave of support for the SNP swept dozens of once safe Labour seats away.In part because Nigel Farage persuaded millions to vote for him but secured just one seat - not, though, the one he was standing in.Read more from Nick Robinson hereThe question uppermost in the prime minister's mind as he assembles his new government is how to keep the kingdom united.""Above all I want to bring our country together,"" he revealed after the result, ""to reclaim a mantle we should never have lost - the mantle of one nation, one United Kingdom"".Looking at the political landscape from Land's End today is very different to the view from John O'Groats.A sea of Conservative and Unionist blue dominates the scene across much of England, while a field of SNP nationalist yellow stretches to the horizon and beyond from the north.David Cameron's greatest challenge is to prevent the union he supports being torn apart by mutual resentment - resentment from Scotland at a Westminster government dominated by English Tories, and resentment from England at the preferential treatment people think is being given to the Scots.Those who assumed the future of the Union had been safeguarded by the Scottish referendum must think again.Read more from Mark Easton hereOne thing is rock-solid true: the Conservatives who worked on this campaign are as surprised by the result as the pollsters, pundits, politicians and general population.Maybe they shouldn't be - the economy is in good shape and the Conservatives had incumbency advantage.But when I travelled back from the prime minister's last rally with a group of exhausted Conservative campaign officials it was clear that 290 seats was a hoped-for target.No-one talked about anything over 300 seats, and no-one even mentioned an overall majority.So what special sauce pushed David Cameron into No 10 with a Commons majority?Mr Cameron had two simple messages in the campaign and he rarely veered away from them; the first - the economy is in good shape and the recovery is threatened by Labour. And the second - the SNP would hold a Labour-led government to ransom.Read more from Jonny Dymond hereBrian Taylor, BBC political editor, ScotlandOf all the comments on the overnight apocalypse, undoubtedly the most straightforward came from a defeated Scottish Labour MP.Since there were quite a few of them, let me narrow the focus a little. Come on down, Tom Harris.Mr Harris had plainly anticipated defeat. Nonetheless, he looked suitably lugubrious as his fate was confirmed.Why, he was asked eagerly, had Labour lost? ""Because we did not win enough votes.""Psephologically, it is perfect. Complete in itself. Psychologically, it sums up Labour's gloom without descending into subsidiary matters such as leadership, strategy and the rest. As a forward-thinking strategy, it is ideal. Win more votes. Simple.Read more from Brian Taylor hereThis has been an election which may have more profound consequences than almost any in living memory.We now face a generational decision about our future in Europe, with an EU referendum in two years' time almost certain.There will also be serious questions about the future of the Union, following an SNP landslide that has turned Scotland into a virtual one-party state.David Cameron's victory also represents a colossal achievement.Only once before in recent history has an incumbent government increased its majority - and that was Mrs Thatcher in her prime in the 1980s.It is also a significant personal victory for Mr Cameron and a rebuff for those in his party who had become increasingly sceptical about his ability to win.But while it may represent a defeat for those Tories who saw this election as a potential opportunity to rid themselves of David Cameron, he must now govern with a wafer-thin majority.For the SNP, their stunning victory can only increase the pressure on Nicola Sturgeon to include a commitment to a second independence referendum in her party's manifesto for next year's Scottish elections.It is an election which has not just defied all the predictions of the pollsters and pundits - but which may yet prompt the most fundamental re-casting of British politics for a generation.Read more from Norman Smith hereAfter an extraordinary night, some brief conclusions:Read more from James Landale hereIs this the end of the union?That is the question many people will be asking this morning after the party which has fought for Scottish independence for 80 years swept to victory.The answer from the jubilant Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon is a firm ""No"".She insists that her MPs will speak for all of Scotland, not just for the 45% who voted for the country to leave the United Kingdom last September.In the closing hours of the most extraordinary election campaign which anyone in Scotland can remember, Ms Sturgeon turned to talk of ""legitimacy.""That will be her watchword in the coming days as she argues that the prime minister cannot ignore the democratic will of the Scottish people.Politically, Scotland and England this morning look and feel like very different countries.Read more from James Cook hereAfter weeks of chatter about an election too close to call, it wasn't that close at all.David Cameron will be continuing as our prime minister.So, what is all this likely to mean?A referendum on whether the UK stays in, or leaves, the European Union, within the next two-and-a-half years.A race to be the next leader of the Labour Party.A race to be the next leader of the Liberal Democrats.And a huge new presence of Scottish National Party MPs at Westminster.And so here's another thing we know for certain this morning: Politics ain't going to be boring any time soon.Read more from Chris Mason hereFor Labour the story of their terrible night is rapidly turning into the search for a new leader. So who will that be?Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, is almost certain to run.  Even before this election, both he and another almost inevitable candidate, Chuka Umunna, had raised eyebrows inside the party at the work they had put in, preparing the ground with members and the unions for potential bids.Yvette Cooper, before the election, was still thought not to have made up her mind over whether to run. That decision has been made perhaps a little easier as her husband, Ed Balls, has lost his seat.She is certainly potentially in the frame, along with two lesser known names - Liz Kendall and Dan Jarvis - two MPs who were only elected in 2010 for the first time. This could be their moment. But whoever is in the job, they face a monumental task.Read Laura Kuenssberg's Twitter hereSterling is up (the most for seven years against the euro), share prices are up (especially bank shares like Lloyds and RBS, and energy shares such as Centrica), government bond prices are up.To state the obvious, investors love the Tories' general election victory.There are a few reasons.One (no surprise here) is that Labour's threat of breaking up banks and imposing energy price caps has been lifted.Second is that investors have been discounting days and weeks of wrangling after polling day over who would form the government - and so they are semi-euphoric that we already know who's in charge.Third, many investors tend to be economically conservative and instinctively Conservative.But although the City may be a bit drunk on the result, its pleasure in Ed Miliband's and Ed Balls' humiliation may be making it a bit blind - perhaps dangerously so - to some bumps in the economic road ahead.Read more from Robert Peston hereNigel Farage dreamed of holding the balance of power, but in the end his UKIP party is now worse off than when it came into the election.At the seventh time of asking he was rejected - this time by the people of Thanet South. It was a similar story in Rochester and Strood where Mark Reckless, who sensationally defected from the Tories last year, was also sent packing.In seats on UKIP's target list, like Thurrock in Essex, the party failed to make gains. In Grimsby - where Mr Farage went twice in the last six weeks - they came third.UKIP got around four million votes - with especially strong showings in north-east and south-east England - but it's ended up with just one MP, and a vacancy at the top. This has led to UKIP attacking the current system of choosing MPs, which it's described as ""busted"" and ""dysfunctional"".In one sense, this campaign was a complete failure and it's left an aftermath of angry voters, and others wondering if the UKIP bubble has burst.Read Robin Brant's Twitter hereI monitored 91 GB-wide voting intention polls during the 2015 election campaign and found nothing in them to prepare me for the final outcome.The good news for the pollsters was that their share for the Lib Dems was pretty close, as were the shares for UKIP, the Greens and the catch-all category of Others.The bad news for the polling industry was that the crucial shares for Conservative and Labour were the ones where they came most adrift.When all the qualifications of margins of error are allowed, there did appear to be a systematic overstatement of the Labour share and an equally systematic understatement of the Conservative one.It is for the pollsters to decide whether to conduct a review of their performance but I trust they will avoid the initial knee-jerk reaction of the immediate aftermath of the 1992 polls debacle.This general election performance follows the performance of the polls in the 2014 Scottish referendum where the choice was simply binary and yet all the polls were out by between 4-6%.Something is wrong. A lot of us would like to know what it is.Read more from David Cowling hereThe words ""political earthquake"" have been translated into numerous European languages, making front page news across the continent.While Britons now examine the domestic minutiae of the election result, here in mainland Europe the vote means one thing: a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU.

David Cameron's victory also represents a colossal achievement.""James Landale, deputy political editor: ""After an extraordinary night, some brief conclusions: With a small majority or slight minority for David Cameron, Tory MPs will be much empowered. As such, Mr Cameron will need support from other parties to get business through.

2015-05-18,A history of political plots,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32749971,"Nigel Farage has apparently seen off a challenge to his leadership of UKIP - a move described by his former election strategist as a ""coup"". He's not the only party leader to face an attempted ousting. But can you recover from such a revolt?In 2006, the Labour prime minister was the target of what became known as the ""curry house conspiracy"" - a coup to remove him and install his chancellor, Gordon Brown, as prime minister.It would lead to several of the plotters' resignations - but not Mr Blair's. However, it was successful to a degree in that it forced the party leader into naming a departure date.The move against him was reportedly masterminded by Tom Watson, a defence minister at the time, who was also rumoured to have had a secret meeting with Mr Brown on the eve of the revolt.Apparently, Mr Watson and three fellow West Midlands MPs - Sion Simon, David Wright (both ministerial aides) and Khalid Mahmood - met over a biryani at a Wolverhampton curry house to discuss the PM's future, before dispatching a missive calling for him to quit.The letter - which attracted the support of a number of normally loyal Labour MPs - was leaked to the press, and ultimately resulted in Mr Watson's resignation.In his parting letter, the West Bromwich East MP took a shot at the prime minister, who he said should step down in the interests of party and country.Mr Blair denounced his actions and branded the former minister ""disloyal, discourteous and wrong"", saying he would have sacked him if he had not resigned.But Mr Watson's departure was swiftly followed by the resignations of six other junior members of government - who had also signed the rebel letter - in protest at the prime minister's refusal to say when he would step down as Labour leader.The whole affair resulted in Mr Blair announcing his intention to step aside within 12 months - which he duly did, on 27 June 2007.But it did nothing to quash internal dissent and speculation in the party over the future leadership of the party.Labour prime minister Gordon Brown found his leadership under threat in 2009 after one of his cabinet ministers dramatically quit the government and called for him to resign.Work and Pensions Secretary James Purnell - a former aide to Tony Blair - resigned from his post after the polls closed in the local and European elections, in which Labour was forecast to do badly.Explaining his decision to quit, Mr Purnell said the prime minister made a Conservative victory ""more, not less, likely"".It was Mr Brown's first direct challenge from a cabinet minister - but it would not topple the Labour leader as senior members of government refused to follow Mr Purnell's lead.Mr Brown was safe for the time being. But several months later, in January 2010, a fresh leadership challenge was mounted by two senior former Labour cabinet ministers.Geoff Hoon and Patricia Hewitt wrote to all Labour MPs, saying the party was ""deeply divided"" over Mr Brown's leadership and that the best way to resolve the issue was by way of secret ballot.They insisted it was not an ""attempted coup"" but a necessary step to resolve divisions within the party.But the duo could only muster the public support of a handful of backbenchers long-opposed to Mr Brown, with the majority of the party's MPs less than impressed by the move, which came just weeks before the general election.As the day wore on, a succession of cabinet ministers came out to back the PM, suggesting there was little momentum behind the plot - although it was noted that several were not exactly gushing in their support of Mr Brown.As history tells us, neither leadership challenge bore fruit but they reflected the internal doubts and divisions over Mr Brown at the helm.As leadership toppling attempts go, this one in 2014 was regarded as a particularly ""botched"" and ""shambolic coup"". Indeed, former Lib Dem leader Lord (Paddy) Ashdown described the move as a ""plot of deep malice"".Its instigator, Lord (Matthew) Oakeshott - a close ally of the-then Business Secretary Vince Cable - tried to unseat Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg.The peer was found to have commissioned secret polls suggesting the party would do better at the 2015 general election without Mr Clegg in the driving seat.The man Lord Oakeshott had long had in mind to take Mr Clegg's place - Mr Cable, who was on government business in China at the time - was forced to publicly condemn his friend's actions and state his backing for Mr Clegg.But Lord Oakeshott said the business secretary had in fact known about his polls and their findings.Nevertheless, the peer - who was denounced by the Lib Dem leadership for spending money that could have been spent on campaigning - quit the party, and issued a warning shot on his way out about the Lib Dems' future prospects.Mr Cable largely emerged unscathed but he faced questions about his loyalty to the leader. Although the two sought to put paid to reports of a rift with a (painfully awkward, 'nothing to see here, folks') stage-managed pint in a pub.Although the revolt failed, and Mr Clegg remained at the helm, the Lib Dems did go on to suffer a trouncing at the general election, losing nearly 50 of its MPs - one of them, Mr Cable himself - prompting his leader to quit.The Conservatives have a reputation for being more ruthless than their party rivals when it comes to getting rid of leaders they sense are no longer effectual.But, in 1995, Prime Minister John Major - tired of persistent rumours of a leadership challenge - decided to take the bull by the horns and trigger a surprise leadership election to silence his detractors.His own backbenchers had questioned Mr Major's ability to unite and lead the party, which was deeply divided over Europe.So ""put up or shut up"", he told them as he tendered his resignation as Conservative Party leader but not prime minister.But then stepped forward eurosceptic MP John Redwood, who resigned from the cabinet in order to contest Mr Major's leadership.This was unexpected by many, as the PM had said there had been assurances from his cabinet that none would stand against him.But Mr Major went on to win the ensuing election with a comfortable defeat over his challenger, who was not included in the PM's consequent cabinet reshuffle.No further contested leadership election took place until after the Conservatives' defeat at the 1997 general election, paving the way for William Hague to take over the running of the party.Not all attempts to oust a party leader end in failure: as Margaret Thatcher found out to her peril.With three electoral victories under her belt, the Conservative prime minister's downfall would come at the hands of her own party - not the voters.It was on 1 November 1990 when Geoffrey (now Lord) Howe - one of Mrs Thatcher's longest-serving ministers - resigned over differences with the party leader over Europe.In his now infamous speech on the floor of the House of Commons, he attacked the PM's policies and leadership style, comparing being one of her cabinet ministers to opening the batting at cricket only to find his bat had been ""broken... by the team captain"".It sparked the beginning of the end of the 11-year Thatcher reign.Michael (now Lord) Heseltine seized on the opportunity to challenge the prime minister in the ensuing leadership contest, from which she would eventually withdraw and John Major emerge as her successor. Reflecting on the revolt and its implications on the Conservative Party, Baroness Thatcher's biographer Charles Moore wrote: ""Because the coup was unjustified, and so trust broke down, the politics of the next 15 years were those of civil war."""
2015-05-18,Election swings and roundabouts,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-32741924,"If election manifesto claims are all about smoke and mirrors, should we now add swings and roundabouts to the political metaphor?There's an intriguing aspect to the general election results in the Midlands that puzzled me.It's the striking contrast in the swings between Labour and the Conservatives.David Cameron and his campaign strategists knew they were home and dry when Nuneaton was the first Midlands marginal to declare.It was not only a Tory hold but a swing to the Conservatives from Labour of 3%.I was in the Nottingham suburb of Beeston awaiting the result of the Broxtowe count. Would its high profile Conservative MP Anna Soubry survive a red surge?Nuneaton set the pattern. Across the Midlands, both east and west, there was a uniform swing of between three and four per cent to the Tories - Warwickshire North 3%, Amber Valley 4%, Derbyshire South 4% and Sherwood 4%. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan topped the Tory swingometer in the Midlands marginals with 5% in Loughborough.Yet in the big cities, it was a very different story. The swing went to Labour.So in Nottingham East they enjoyed a 6% swing, Nottingham South 5.8%, Leicester South 7.3%, Leicester West 5%, Birmingham Hall Green 12%, Birmingham Hodge Hill 8%.If swings to Labour on this scale had gone beyond the city ring road roundabouts and into the suburbs, Ed Miliband would have become prime minister by now.In confidence, one senior Labour insider in Nottingham told me its success in the city wards was down to organisation, experience and its teams of activists.""We won the ground war. If Nottingham's city boundaries were extended into Sherwood and Broxtowe, we would have won those constituencies as well,"" he told me.Labour leadership candidate, Leicester West's Liz Kendall has identified her party's problem beyond the ring road roundabout.It's about reaching out to Middle England.""We need to show people that we understand their aspirations and ambitions for the future,"" she told the Sunday Times.The problem for Labour was that Middle England was not interested in what the party offered…and still isn't. The Cameron brand worked its magic in those Midlands marginals... it'll take something or someone special to break up that ballot box relationship."
2015-05-18,Royal 'lobbying',https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32740154,"Prince Charles sent 27 letters to then Prime Minister Tony Blair and members of his government between September 2004 and March 2005, ""despite the Freedom of Information Act!"" as the prince joked in one.But did his suggestions and concerns have any bearing on the behaviour of Mr Blair's government?The request: Prince Charles expresses his worries over an EU directive on complementary medicines ""which is… effectively outlawing the use of certain herbal extracts"".  Mr Blair replied, offering moral support and practical help. He agreed that ""the implementation as it is currently planned is crazy"" and set out an action plan that included delaying implementation for all existing products to 2011. What happened: Herbal products were not required to be authorised until 2011, just as Mr Blair had promised. Prince Charles continues to sell his own brand of complementary products, Duchy Herbals, through Boots and Waitrose. The request: Writing to Mr Blair, the prince expresses a ""growing sense of anxiety"" that the Hill Farming Allowance, which supports farmers working on Britain's uplands, could be scrapped. In his reply, the prime minister said he understood that the Hill Farm Allowance would continue until 2007. What happened: The allowance lasted until the end of Labour's tenure in 2010, when it was abolished.The request: Just 18 months after the US-led invasion of Iraq, Prince Charles raised the issue of poor performance of Lynx helicopters in high temperatures, saying: ""I fear that this is just one more example of where our Armed Forces are being asked to do an extremely challenging job (particularly in Iraq) without the necessary resources.""Mr Blair replied: ""On the subject of the Lynx helicopter, the limitations of the existing platform, particularly in the extremely challenging environment within Iraq, are well recognised by the Ministry of Defence."" He added that replacement of the helicopters would be a priority. What happened: Mr Blair's comments go much further than what he was saying about the subject at the time. In the event, though, the fleet was not fully upgraded until 2011.The request: Prince Charles lamented that the government's TB prevention plans might not ""include a commitment to deal with the badger problem in the immediate future"" and pushed strongly for a cull, saying: ""All I can say is that I do urge you to look again at introducing a proper cull of badgers where it is necessary.""Mr Blair sympathised, saying he could ""personally see the case for culling badgers"". However, he was unwilling to commit to a cull.  What happened: Culling trials were conducted from 1998-2005. The final results, published in 2008, said that the badger cull could ""make no meaningful contribution"" to curbing bovine TB. It wasn't until 2013 that a full culling programme began in two pilot areas. These ended with the conclusion that the pilots had been neither humane nor effective at curbing the spread of TB.The request: Then Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell wrote to Prince Charles to say she had decided to give parts of the historic Smithfield meat market Grade II listed status, and was trying to persuade deputy prime minister John Prescott to ""call in"" the planning application to prevent demolition of other parts of the site. She had been swayed by evidence provided by Sir Neil Cossons, who was English Heritage chair at the time, after he had been asked by the prince to add his support. Prince Charles replied that he was ""extremely glad to read of your appreciation of the value of this group of buildings"". According to the Guardian, market workers desperate to see the redevelopment of the site invited the prince to meet them to discuss it, but his office said he was ""unlikely to accept as he did not want to interfere in the planning process"".What happened: Smithfield market is still the subject of planning battles a decade on. Successive planning applications have been refused by ministers. Last year then Communities Secretary Eric Pickles rejected plans for an office development on the site, stating that ""the extent of damage that the application would cause to the important heritage assets at Smithfield runs entirely counter to national and policy objectives intended to protect such assets from harm"".In March, the Museum of London announced a move from its current Barbican site to the Smithfield market building."
2015-05-18,Election fallout,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32703139,"""Some of those gimmicks - that tombstone, whatever idiot thought that up I do not know!""I was talking to the former Mayor of Crawley in Sussex, John Mortimer, in the town's Labour Supporters Club about the vexed question of what went wrong, and where Labour should go next. This seat is one of those southern seats Labour hoped to take, but failed.I hear a whole range of views in the club.""They didn't give nothing to depend on, they should be clear, and a little bit more down to Earth."" ""Good party, wrong leader, they don't look after business enough.""Councillor John Stanley tells me: ""I think in a way we did go too left, but now we can go a bit centre-left, or centre, depending who the new leader is.""The former mayor sums up the mood on the doorstep: ""Whatever we told them, they didn't believe us.""  Expect to hear all those views, and more, in the coming leadership contest. Step back from the angst of supporters, and it may not be that hard to see why Labour failed.  An economic recovery, hailed by independent organisations as the result of government policy, undid a party that had loudly proclaimed for five years that the coalition's policies would lead to economic disaster. Combine that with an uncharismatic and uninspirational leader, then you might argue no further debate is necessary.Fat chance of that. Defeat breeds resentment, and this one has opened up old divisions.  A chorus of Blairties, led by the man himself, has declared that Ed's problem was ignoring those with aspiration and ambition, failing to appeal to those running business. Incidentally, I've been ticked off by the perspicacious editor of the New Statesman, Jason Cowley, for using the ""unhelpful"" term ""Blairites"".I can't think of another description that fits Tony, Lord Mandelson, Lord Adonis and David Miliband quite so well. But call them what you will, the message was clear - Ed was too left wing, Labour should move back to the centre, or, if you like, to the right.Reading Mr Blair's pithy analysis, listening to Lord Mandelson's gripping and savage eloquence, describing a party sent out to shout: ""We love the poor and hate the rich,"" and so ignoring the middle, and you realise strong emotions are in play.But back to the future may not be sufficient. Of course elections are won on the centre ground. But grandees grinding axes, affronted by the failure of boys who used to make their tea, may be creating so much noise that they can't hear more insistent sounds.  For there are several elephants trumpeting loudly as they cram into the small space of the shadow cabinet room. Imagine these beasts are as gaily decorated as Berlin buddy bears. One is decked out in red, another in imperial purple bunting, and another, a mammoth, strong tusked and ice rimmed, painted yellow with tartan trimmings.Take the last first. The Scottish wipeout is Labour's biggest problem. Fail to solve it, and Labour can forget ever having a comfortable majority again. It is hard to argue Labour were wiped out in Scotland because the SNP outflanked them to the right with their appeal to the business community and the ambitious and aspirational. But it is true the SNP drew in to people from left, right and centre, just as the modernisers say Labour should. It was the politics of economic self-interest, but cast in a very different light. Tribally sneering at ""the reactionary ideology of nationalism"" as Mr Blair does, will not reach the central belt of Scotland, the middle ground of  Midlothian.What about that purple pachyderm?  In Crawley - in fact in seat after seat - there is a similar pattern.  Labour did, in fact, often increase the size of their vote. So did the Conservatives, usually by a bit more. But the real dynamic was the total collapse of the Lib Dems and the dramatic rise of UKIP. The increase in votes for Nigel Farage's party wasn't translated into parliamentary seats, but, although it is early days in terms of research, it probably hurt Labour a lot. If we believe - and I do - Matthew Goodwin and Rob Ford, authors of Revolt on the Right, these voters are often former Labour supporters - older, less educated, those left behind on the tides of  globalisation, stranded on the shores of post-industrialisation. They may have had too many disappointments to feel much ambition or aspiration. They are a challenge for Labour, and any new leader will spend a good deal of time thinking how to deal with the concerns of Europe and immigration.Whether to share their fears, or confront them will be a big decision.Which brings us to Red Nellie. Those members who still proudly call themselves socialist. This is not about Old Labour - they are more likely to be baristas or barristers than boilermakers. It is easy as an outsider, as a journalist, to treat politics as an intellectual game about how best to win power - but many people, particularly the foot soldiers, particularly after the death of  purely tribal loyalties, are in it because they passionately believe in winning  power to do something specific.Many of them are suspicious of the later incarnations of New Labour, not because it reached an accommodation with wealth and business, but because it seemed to worship at the same altar, to regard the party's core beliefs in redistribution and equality as childish fantasies from a past age.Perhaps to Mr Blair, they are the problem, people who may equate ""ambition"" with greed. They might point out that a man who claims to be worth ""only"" £20m may find it harder than most to squeeze through the eye of a needle to understand their point of view. Most successful Labour leaders will confront the left at some point, but the concerns of this group go to the existential question ""What is the party for?""This is not a polemic - not an argument about what should be done, but a reflection on the complex conundrums that will face any new Labour leader, the tearing apart of the old alliance that made up a Labour majority, and so the political need to satisfy groups with very different, indeed, contradictory demands. But looking for a Social Democratic universal theory of everything may be missing the point. What the party desperately wants is a leader who can pull the disparate threads together and articulate them as common purpose. Whether she or he exists is another matter.Much more on that in the coming months."
2015-05-18,'Take us with you',https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-32736153,"Thousands of people in the north of England have been using the hashtag ""take us with you Scotland"" to express their upset about the result of last week's general election, and Scottish nationalists are welcoming this English minority with open arms. Last Thursday's general election was a rough one for the Labour Party in its traditional stronghold in the north of England. But further to the north, the left-leaning Scottish National Party won nearly every seat it contested. That political contrast has made some left-wing voters in places like Manchester, Leeds and Sheffield look fondly on their neighbours. Since last Thursday's election in Britain the phrase ""take us with you Scotland"" has been used more than 24,000 times. ""Genuinely beginning to wonder if the North of England becoming a part of Scotland would be better for us, I really am,"" tweeted Aaron Miller from Yorkshire. Some cracked jokes under the tag after the North West Motorway Police account, which gives traffic updates, announced that they had ""picked up a pedestrian on the M62 who was trying to walk to Scotland.""After an initial spike of jokes over the weekend, the hashtag really took off when users start to mobilise in support of around a year-old petition on the campaigning site Change.org. The petition calls for the north of England to secede from the rest of the country and join up with Scotland, and more than 12,000 people have signed it.Its creator, a Sheffield resident who calls himself ""Stu Dent"", set it up to coincide with last year's Scottish independence referendum, and he also created a map imagining the boundary of a ""Scotland plus the north"" country.Stu Dent runs the Twitter account Hunters Bar, named after an area of southwest Sheffield which is very popular with - you guessed it - students. Despite the account having thousands of followers on Twitter, when the map was first posted last year, the image was shared only about 100 times - however, in the past week it's been retweeted by thousands. Stu Dent told BBC Trending that he was surprised at how popular his idea has become. ""In hindsight, perhaps I shouldn't have been,"" he said. ""There is a huge frustration in parts of the UK about the things that have happened since 2010.""""I think people need a place to go where they can say 'not in my name!

2015-05-18,What Britain wants from Europe,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32695399,"David Cameron says he has a mandate to pursue EU reform following the Conservatives' general election victory. The PM, who will be hoping his majority government will give him extra leverage in Brussels, wants to renegotiate the terms of the UK's membership ahead of a referendum by the end of 2017. He has said he will campaign for Britain to remain in the EU if he gets the reforms he wants.Mr Cameron has said he does not want to reveal full details of his negotiating hand but he has given a broad indication, in a series of speeches and newspaper articles, of his priorities when he goes into talks with other EU leaders.These are: The prime minister has said Britain would resist any move towards a European Army and that he wants to free British police forces from EU interference. He has also ruled out Britain joining the euro.But he has placed less emphasis in recent years on demanding changes to EU social policy, such as the maximum 48-hour working week, agency workers, maternity leave and non-discrimination rules.The official UK government position is that a referendum will be held by the end of 2017 but Downing Street sources have said: ""If we can do it earlier we will.""There is speculation David Cameron is planning to hold the vote in 2016 to avoid a clash with French and German elections in 2017.The prime minister wants treaty change but even if the referendum was held in 2017 there may not be enough time to legally incorporate any reforms into a treaty and it would have to be done at a later stage.An early referendum would anger Eurosceptics who believe it would not allow enough time to make the case for exit or negotiate any meaningful concessions.""A rushed process would severely undermine the chances to secure a significant deal that both British business and voters could support and would waste the opportunity of a lifetime,"" Matthew Elliott, chief executive of Business for Britain told Breitbart London.The question is always crucial in any referendum and there is already a debate about what it should be. The Draft European Union (Referendum) Bill, published by the Conservatives in 2013, proposed this form of words: ""Do you think that the United Kingdom should remain a member of the European Union?""Some thought that leaned too far towards the status quo, encouraging a yes vote, and the Electoral Commission said it was not clear and direct enough. The watchdog proposed this form of words instead: ""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union?""The new Conservative government will attempt to repeal the Human Rights Act, which requires UK courts to treat the European Court of Human Rights as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. The European Court of Human Rights is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe (CoE), which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine.The freedom for people to move around Europe, enshrined in the EU treaties, works in parallel with the other three basic freedoms in the single market: freedom of goods, capital and services.It is likely to be a ""red line"" for other EU leaders, who do not want to see it eroded.Mr Cameron has steered clear of tackling it directly - for example by asking for an emergency ""brake"" on free movement, or a cap on numbers - focusing instead on reducing the incentive provided by welfare payments. In a speech last November, David Cameron set out measures to reduce the number of EU nationals moving to the UK.His main proposals were:Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission, has said he is ready to work with Mr Cameron to ""strike a fair deal for the United Kingdom in the EU"". The leaders of other EU nations have previously warned they are unlikely to support major changes to EU treaties to accommodate British demands. But Mr Cameron's general election victory may have given him extra leverage. ""The ball is very much in the court of the UK now,"" a senior EU official told The Guardian. ""It's up to the British to define what they want."" The key figure will be German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is very keen to keep Britain in the EU but has so far been unwilling to make major concessions to enable that to happen. There are fears that a ""pick and mix"" approach to EU treaties would undermine EU cohesion.Mr Cameron has said there is ""no doubt"" his planned reforms will require changes to the treaties governing the European Union. But this would require the unanimous support of all EU members, and may not be possible within the deadline he has set of a referendum before the end of 2017. Any attempt to change EU laws on free movement would meet fierce resistance from some EU nations, particularly Eastern European states. Mr Juncker has said free movement is non-negotiable.Mr Cameron may find it difficult to get unanimous support for his proposals for a four-year waiting period for migrant workers claiming UK benefits. East European EU members would be likely to oppose this, on the grounds that it would discriminate against their citizens.  Attempts to secure opt-outs for the City are unlikely to go down well with other European leaders.However, there are precedents for EU treaty changes to accommodate some countries' specific concerns - for example, the protocol attached to the Lisbon Treaty for Ireland.Mr Cameron has faced repeated calls to say whether he would campaign for Britain's exit from the EU in the referendum if he fails to get what he wants from the renegotiation process. All he has said is that he will ""rule nothing out"". Some Conservative MPs want Britain to leave the EU no matter what David Cameron manages to renegotiate. A larger group are likely to want more concessions than Mr Cameron has so far indicated he is prepared to demand.Senior backbencher David Davis, who was defeated by Mr Cameron for the Tory leadership in 2005, told the Daily Telegraph the majority of the 332 Conservative MPs want Mr Cameron to negotiate an ""opt-out"" power to stop individual EU laws from applying to Britain. The prime minister has said this would be ""impossible"" without Britain leaving the EU.Mr Davis claims as many as 60 Tory MPs would be prepared to rebel and vote for Britain's exit from the EU if the prime minister fails to deliver.Graham Brady, chairman of the Tory backbench 1922 committee, which represents backbenchers, has urged David Cameron to give all Conservative MPs, including ministers, a free vote in the EU referendum.In January, Mr Cameron warned that serving cabinet ministers would have to quit the government if they wanted to campaign to leave the EU if he had secured the reforms to it he wants.In the 1975 referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Economic Community, as the EU was then called, Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson decided to suspend collective responsibility because his cabinet was split on the issue. Ministers were allowed to vote with their consciences and campaign against each other. The majority of them, including Mr Wilson, joined the Yes camp, but left-wingers, such as Tony Benn, played a leading role in the No campaign. The Yes campaign won easily with 67% of the vote."

2015-05-19,Scots Labour leader Murphy to resign,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32760196,"Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy is to resign next month, he has announced.It comes despite Mr Murphy narrowly surviving a vote of no confidence at a meeting of the party's national executive in Glasgow. Mr Murphy said he would tender his resignation alongside a plan to reform the party.He lost his seat in last week's general election as the SNP won 56 of the 59 Scottish seats, leaving Labour with a single MP in Scotland.Mr Murphy said he wanted to have a successor as leader in place by the summer, and confirmed he would not be standing for a seat at the Scottish Parliament in next year's election. Instead, he said it was time to ""do something else"" and that he believed the party would continue to be divided if he remained as leader. His deputy, Kezia Dugdale MSP, will become acting leader until a permanent successor is found. Mr Murphy had faced calls to resign from several MSPs, trade unions and former MPs in the wake of his party's near wipeout at the general election.He insisted he had decided to stand down ahead of the national executive voting by 17-14 in favour of him staying in the job.Speaking at a media conference after the national executive meeting, he said: ""It is clear that a small minority who didn't accept my election as leader of the Scottish Labour Party just five months ago won't accept the vote of the executive today and that will continue to divide the party.""Today I received more support in the executive vote than I did from members of the executive when I stood for election five months ago.""He said it would be up to the executive whether to accept the reforms he would be proposing before he left the post. But he warned: ""A party in such urgent need of reform blocks those changes at its peril.""The former East Renfrewshire MP said Labour had been crushed between ""two nationalisms"" in Scotland and England.Mr Murphy said he left no legacy of bitterness for anyone in the Labour Party, and the only person he was angry at was the person who blamed Scottish Labour for the party's UK-wide general election defeat - a reference to Unite leader Len McCluskey.And he said that in many ways Scottish Labour was the ""least modernised part of the Labour movement"" and that he wanted his successor to be elected under a one member, one vote system.Mr Murphy added: ""The Labour Party's problem is not the link with trade unions, or even the relationship with Unite members - far from it. It is the destructive behaviour of one high profile trade unionist.""The leader of the Scottish Labour Party doesn't serve at the grace of Len McCluskey, and the next leader of the UK Labour Party should not be picked by Len McCluskey.""Mr McCluskey has been a vocal critic of Mr Murphy's leadership and opposed his appointment in December when Mr Murphy won the contest to replace Johann Lamont.Jim Murphy laughed and joked with Scottish Labour's sole MP as he made his way down the hotel corridor to announce his resignation.He certainly brought energy and dynamism to his election campaign - but all that achieved was Ian Murray in Edinburgh South.So as Mr Murphy bows out, who could replace him?The deputy leader Kezia Dugdale may want to step up or Neil Findlay could try again after challenging last time. Maybe the party's finance spokeswoman Jackie Baillie thinks her steady hand could steer the ship.Jenny Marra is also often talked about as future face of the party.Whoever steps into Jim Murphy's red shoes he or she will have to face a difficult 2016 Holyrood election, to put it mildly.There are also more fundamental questions about how the party can possibly move on as it faces a surging SNP.Mr Murphy was very much a creature of ""New Labour"" - but to today's generation that's old Labour.Party members may start looking for someone with no links to the past, neither a Brownite nor a Blairite. A 'cleanskin' - as the politicos put it - may well help re-connect with voters.That's a long way from now though - even some of the party's opponents may view this latest train wreck with a modicum of sympathy. Ms Lamont had resigned after claiming Scottish Labour was treated like a ""branch office"" by the London-based party leadership.Mr Murphy concluded his speech by saying: ""Scotland needs a strong Labour party; Scotland needs a united Labour party. We have been the greatest force for change in our nation's remarkable history. ""The Scottish Labour party will rise again. It will be under someone else's leadership and I am confident about my party's future.""Harriet Harman MP, acting leader of the UK Labour Party, said it would be for Scottish Labour to choose a new leader. She added: ""As a cabinet minister and leader of his party in Scotland, Jim has been a hugely important figure in the Labour Party. He leaves with the best wishes and thanks of our movement.""Labour peer Lord McConnell, a former Scottish first minister, said the party's problems were ""much deeper than one individual and one affiliate"".He said: ""We have a disconnect locally and nationally with wider Scottish society. ""We have a problem with our political positioning in the post devolution age where the party particularly at the UK level has never been comfortable with success in the Scottish parliament and has always tried to see things through a UK prism rather than a Scottish prism.""We need to find a new generation, a new leader, new generation, new ideas, a fresh approach.""In a tweet, Scottish first minister and SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said: ""I wish Jim Murphy all the very best for the future. Leadership is not easy and he deserves credit for standing up for what he believes in.""Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson also reacted on Twitter, saying: ""Jim Murphy announces a managed exit in order to help the party, which is to his credit. But leaves a tough gig for whoever comes next.""The meeting of Scottish Labour's executive was disrupted by protesters who entered the party's headquarters.Police were called and the protesters, who included persistent anti-austerity activists Sean Clerkin and Piers Doughty-Brown, left the building to protest further from the street outside.The protesters were calling for Mr Murphy to remain as leader to ""finish the job of destroying Scottish Labour"".A Police Scotland spokeswoman said officers had been called and found two protestors on the third floor of the building. She added: ""Both left on police arrival. Advice and assistance was given."""
2015-05-19,Labour contenders clash on spending,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32761561,"Prospective Labour leaders have clashed over Labour's record in government in their first public debate in the race to succeed Ed Miliband.Former cabinet ministers including Yvette Cooper and Andy Burnham defended Labour's fiscal record and spending on schools and hospitals.However, candidates from the 2010 intake of MPs argued that the party spent too much while in office.The debate followed Chuka Umunna's withdrawal from the leadership contest.The remaining candidates appeared at the annual conference of the Progress think tank in London.There was agreement that Labour needed to demonstrate economic credibility to regain power, with shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt telling the meeting that the party needed to be ""trusted with public finances and the family finances"".Mr Hunt, who was first elected to Parliament in 2010 when Labour lost power, argued the last Labour government ""spent too much"" and failed to ""leave enough economic headroom to deal with the economic crisis and the recession"".Shadow health minister Liz Kendall said: ""There's absolutely nothing progressive about spending more on debt interest payments than on educating our children.""But shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: ""The Tories have had a triumph of spin over the facts in saying what they said about the economic record of the last Labour government.""The former chief secretary to the Treasury said the deficit did ""grow too large"" in the government's later years but insisted: ""The last Labour government ran more surpluses in its first term than the Tories did in 18 years.""Yvette Cooper, another former chief secretary to the Treasury, said: ""We should never let anybody tell us that it was too many teachers, doctors or nurses that caused Lehman Brothers bank in New York to crash.""Shadow international development secretary Mary Creagh said: ""People have forgotten the economic credibility that the last Labour government had.""She said Labour had built schools and hospitals that were ""treasured in our communities"".Ms Cooper, Mr Burnham, Ms Kendall and Ms Creagh have declared their intention to run for leader, while Mr Hunt told the conference he would make an announcement next week.At the same event, shadow energy secretary Caroline Flint announced she would be running for deputy leader.The Don Valley MP told the Today programme ahead of the debate that Labour lost the election because ""fundamentally the public did not trust us on the economy"".Exeter MP Ben Bradshaw has already announced a bid to be deputy, saying Labour ""must and could win the next election"", but only if it ""broadens its appeal by adopting sensible, centre-left politics which celebrate wealth creation and entrepreneurship"".Former Labour campaign co-ordinator Tom Watson is reported to be crowd-funding a deputy leadership bid, while Walthamstow MP Stella Creasy has said she is ""open to the question"" of running.Barnsley East MP and shadow transport secretary Michael Dugher - a fierce critic of Ed Miliband's election campaign - is to run Mr Burnham's campaign, according to the website LabourList.It is reported that Mr Burnham also has the backing of Labour peer Lord Falconer, who was lord chancellor and justice secretary under Tony Blair and was close to the former PM.Shadow culture secretary Chris Bryant has signalled his backing for Ms Cooper, tweeting that the next leader must be ""someone who's been tried in the fiery furnace of public opinion"".Mr Hunt said on Friday he would be be attending the debate - along with the other four hopefuls - to ""set out my analysis on how we begin to understand what went so wrong and why"".He added: ""We must use this leadership election to ask some very profound questions.""All voices in the party must be heard so that we can have a full and proper assessment as to why the politics of nationalism triumphed in Scotland and huge swathes of England, and how we have allowed the Conservative Party to present a more compelling vision for Britain to so many millions of people.""Speculation still surrounds shadow business secretary Mr Umunna's decision to pull out on Friday, when he said he was not ""comfortable"" with the ""pressure"" of being a candidate.As well as citing extensive pressure and scrutiny Mr Umunna also said he was ruling himself out because of concerns about the impact of the bid on his family.A rising star of the party, Mr Umunna was first elected to Parliament in 2010 - alongside Tristram Hunt and Liz Kendall - before joining the shadow cabinet.Asked about the candidate who might win, Conservative Chancellor George Osborne said: ""The Labour leadership contest has descended into farce.""But it's not actually about personalities. I don't think the Labour Party any more represents the working people of this country who aspire to a better life."""

I'm not suggesting he takes a break from being leader.""Clearly the national executive has the authority, they're the ruling body. ""I'm told that they made a decision. I'm told it was a procedurally correct decision, he is the leader but I think it's important that as leader he takes a break and I think it's important that we work out how these complex questions are answered by a team.""No one person has all the answers. I'm particularly concerned about tone, making sure we get a tone that ensures that the 27 million people who didn't vote for UKIP last week may be persuaded to vote for us in future.""The party has been beset by wrangling since Mr Farage agreed to stay on as leader, days after standing down after failing to get elected in Thanet South.He had pledged before the general election that he would quit the post if he failed to get elected to Parliament.Senior aide Matthew Richardson has left the party, following claims from MEP Patrick O'Flynn that Mr Farage had fallen under the influence of ""inexperienced"" advisers.UKIP has also confirmed the departure of Mr Farage's chief of staff Raheem Kassam.Mr Farage ruled out quitting as leader on BBC's Question Time on Thursday, saying he had ""phenomenal"" support, and has challenged his critics to decide whether they want to stay in the party.In his article, Mr Carswell had said that ""knowing how difficult it is to lead a party makes me admire Nigel Farage all the more"".""I know that I never could,"" he added, stressing that he would find it ""impossible to simultaneously lead UKIP, be the voice of the party in the Commons, represent my Clacton constituents and at the same time be a husband and a dad"".However, he said that ""even leaders need to take a break"", adding: ""Nigel needs to take a break now.""UKIP got nearly four million votes at the election, but returned only one MP - former Conservative Mr Carswell in the Clacton constituency."
2015-05-19,Coasting schools 'must improve',https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/education-32763097,"Education Secretary Nicky Morgan has said new powers to sack head teachers in coasting schools will show ""it is not OK to be just above the level of failing"". Under the plans, ministers could force schools rated as ""requiring improvement"" and missing new government benchmarks to become an academy.Coasting schools have average results which have often flatlined over time.Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, Mrs Morgan said faster action was needed.She said: ""Our big priorities will be to speed up the process for tackling failing schools; extend our academies programme to tackle 'coasting' schools; and deliver on our commitment to open new free schools.""The proposals will be in a new bill due to be introduced in the Queen's Speech. ""First, we will take new powers to step in from the moment that a school is found to be failing,"" Mrs Morgan said.""From day one, regional schools commissioners will be able to bring in new leadership and support from other excellent schools and heads, and we will speed up the process of turning schools into academies to make sure that new expert leadership is found for all schools that need it as quickly as possible.""She said that coasting schools will be put on an immediate notice to improve and could then be taken over and turned into an academy.They will be required to work with a team of ""expert"" head teachers.She said: ""Those that aren't able to demonstrate a clear plan for improvement will be given new leadership - we know this works in turning schools around.""More than 3,300 schools in England are labelled ""requires improvement"", but the plans are unlikely to cover that many schools.Under the current system, secondary schools are considered to be failing, and therefore eligible for intervention, if fewer than 40% of their students score at least five Cs at GCSE, including English and maths, and they do not meet national averages in pupil progress.In primary schools, the threshold for intervention is if fewer than 65% of pupils get Level 4 in reading, writing and maths and a below average number of pupils make the expected amount of progress.It is not yet clear how coasting schools will be deemed in need of intervention.It is understood that a new category will be devised covering schools which are rated as ""requires improvement"" and which fail to meet a new set of standards on improvement."
2015-05-19,Co-op Group to keep political funding,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-32762858,"The Co-operative Group has decided to continue financially supporting the Co-operative Party, which has strong ties to Labour.Members of the group, the UK's biggest mutual organisation, voted on the issue at their annual general meeting.They passed a motion by 48,579 for, to 39,479 against, to approve ""political expenditures"" of up to £1m which support the movement's objectives.Last year the Co-op Group gave £625,000 to the Co-op Party.This figure was down on the sums donated in previous years. The AGM also included a vote on new corporate governance procedures which would mean members having less of a direct say.The Co-operative Group is still recovering from a period of financial mismanagement and some members have recently expressed concerns about how elections to the board are chosen.The banking arm of the group came close to collapse in 2013, bringing the whole group to a £2.5bn annual loss that year. The Co-op Party includes among its members a number of Labour MPs, including shadow chancellor Chris Leslie and Walthamstow MP Stella Creasy. The politicians stand as candidates of both the Co-operative Party and the Labour Party, and the two political movements have strong historical ties. The board asked the members of the Co-operative Group whether they wanted to continue financially supporting the Co-operative Party, or any other party. Allan Leighton, chairman of the Co-op Group, said: ""There's a clear remit from the members to continue to support the Labour Party.""It allows us to now have a conversation with the Co-op Labour Party about what we do next.""There was also a members' motion on the agenda, put forward by those in favour of making political donations of up to £1m a year.The motion to approve political funding ""not to exceed £1m per annum"" was carried by 55.17% to 44.83%.BBC business correspondent Joe Lynam said: ""To meet a £1.5bn hole in its accounts - mostly stemming from its banking division - the Co-op Group has had to sell off parts of its businesses and hand over majority control of its bank to American hedge funds.""It's also in the process of radically changing the way it runs itself into a more corporate structure with less of a direct say by its members.""He said that ""in theory"", each of the 2.8 million Co-op members could vote on a series of motions about the reforms, as well as how its bosses are paid, and retaining the links to the Co-operative party.One of the group's largest independent societies, Midcounties, recently threatened legal action over a shortlist of six candidates for the group's board being reduced to three - the number of positions available - before a member vote.

2015-05-19,Osborne plans July 'stability' Budget,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32761566,"Chancellor George Osborne has said that he will deliver a new Budget on 8 July.He claimed it would have ""a laser-like focus"" on raising productivity and living standards.He said he was making the unusual move of having a second Budget in one year in order to ""deliver on the commitments we have made to working people"".Labour said the chancellor would have to set out ""who is going to pay"" for what it called ""uncosted promises"" in the election campaign.Speaking outside 11 Downing Street, the chancellor gave a broad outline of his plans for the forthcoming Budget but refused to be drawn on the details, including the Conservatives' planned £12bn of welfare cuts.""I don't want to wait to deliver on the commitments we have made to working people,"" he said.""It will continue with the balanced plan we have to deal with our debts, invest in our health service and reform welfare to make work pay.""But there will also be a laser-like focus on making our economy more productive so we raise living standards across our country.""We're going to put Britain into good shape for the long term.""The last Budget was held on 18 March and included tax cuts for first-time house buyers.Writing in the Sun, Mr Osborne admitted it was ""unusual"" to have two Budgets in the same year, but he wanted to turn ""promises made in the election into a reality"".Again, Mr Osborne did not specifically outline how the Conservatives plan to fulfil a pledge to cut £12bn in welfare spending but said he wants to make the welfare system ""fair for the people who pay for it"".He writes: ""We will protect the NHS and give it more funding each and every year, while making savings across Whitehall. ""We'll crack down hard on tax avoidance and aggressive tax planning by the rich - because everyone should pay their fair share.  ""We will always protect the most vulnerable, but we also need a welfare system that's fair to the people who pay for it. If you can work you should be working, so we'll take the next steps in our benefit reforms to make sure that happens.""Second, we've got to go on helping businesses create jobs in Britain, so we move towards full employment. That means facing a hard truth: in Britain we produce about a quarter less for every hour we work than countries like America or Germany. Fixing that long-running productivity weakness is the big challenge for the next five years.""So in the Budget we'll spend less on welfare, and instead invest to create three million more apprenticeships, so that young people can learn a trade, get better jobs and earn more.""After the Budget in March independent forecaster the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said that Mr Osborne needed to spell out exactly how he plans to cut £12bn from welfare spending.Of those £12bn planned cuts, £2bn were outlined ahead of the general election - all the cuts are supposed to be in place by 2017-18.Labour's shadow energy and climate change secretary, Caroline Flint, accused the Tories of making ""a number of uncosted promises"" during the election campaign.She told the BBC: ""It will be interesting to see who is going to pay for those uncosted policies when they bring the Budget in July."""
2015-05-19,Farage should take a break - Carswell,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32761766,"UKIP leader Nigel Farage ""needs to take a break now"", the party's only MP Douglas Carswell has said.Writing in the Times, Mr Carswell said he admired Mr Farage, but questioned his ""ill-advised"" comments about HIV patients, made in a TV leaders' debate.Mr Farage ruled out quitting as leader on BBC's Question Time on Thursday, saying he had ""phenomenal"" support.It follows a bitter internal row within the party, which has seen two of Mr Farage's senior aides resigning.In his article, Mr Carswell said that ""knowing how difficult it is to lead a party makes me admire Nigel Farage all the more"".""I know that I never could,"" he added, stressing that he would find it ""impossible to simultaneously lead UKIP, be the voice of the party in the Commons, represent my Clacton constituents and at the same time be a husband and a dad"".However, he said that ""even leaders need to take a break"", adding: ""Nigel needs to take a break now.""He described Mr Farage as ""inspirational"", saying the party had ""done extraordinarily well"" under his leadership but now needed to ""consider carefully what comes next"".Earlier, Mr Farage challenged his critics to decide whether they wanted him to stay in the party.He said he had ""massive"" support from UKIP MEPs, donors and party members to continue in the role, suggesting one person, whom he did not name, was ""agitating for change"".Addressing the prospect of a future EU referendum, Mr Carswell said: ""All of us UKIP supporters should ask one question; Is what I'm doing at this moment making an 'out' vote more likely? If it isn't, stop it and do something else.""He also criticised Mr Farage's comments about HIV patients during the TV leaders' debate last month.While debating about the NHS, Mr Farage said: ""You can come into Britain from anywhere in the world and get diagnosed with HIV and get the retro-viral drugs that cost up to £25,000 per year per patient.""Mr Carswell wrote: ""By all means we should highlight the problem of health tourism. But we need to admit that using the example of HIV patients to make the point was ill-advised.""He said the party needed to strike ""the right tone"" and added: ""UKIP has been at its most persuasive when we have been most optimistic.""Anger is never a great way to motivate people - at least not for very long.""The party has been beset by wrangling since Mr Farage agreed to stay on as leader, days after standing down after failing to get elected in Thanet South.He had pledged before the general election that he would quit the post if he failed to get elected to Parliament.Matthew Richardson has left the party, following claims from MEP Patrick O'Flynn that Mr Farage had fallen under the influence of ""inexperienced"" advisers. UKIP has also confirmed the departure of Mr Farage's chief of staff Raheem Kassam.UKIP got nearly four million votes at the election, but returned only one MP - former Conservative Mr Carswell in the Clacton constituency."
2015-05-19,Tributes as ex-Conservative MP dies,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-northamptonshire-32764540,"Tributes have been paid to former Conservative MP Sir Peter Fry who has died at the age of 83.Sir Peter, who had been ill for a year, was MP for Wellingborough and Rushden, in Northamptonshire, for 28 years from 1969 until his defeat by Labour in 1997.In government he was notable as an expert on transport issues.Current Wellingborough Conservative MP Peter Bone said Sir Peter remained ""extremely well thought of"".""When I was canvassing in the last election, people were still talking about him. They absolutely loved how he helped them and he was a highly-regarded local MP,"" Mr Bone said.""He stood up for what was right rather than what the party line was. In those days - the John Major years - it was much more difficult to stand up against the party machine. He had strong views on Europe.""Sir Peter started his career as an insurance broker, joining the Wycombe Young Conservatives in 1949 and the Oxford University Conservative Association in 1951.He went on to become a Conservative councillor on Buckinghamshire County Council between 1961 and 1967.Wellingborough mayor-elect Barry Graves also paid tribute to Sir Peter, remembering him as a ""very strong constituency MP"".""I remember going out and canvassing with him and he would go everywhere. He knew the area and the people. He was very much a man of the local constituency.""He was ""a very approachable man"", Mr Graves added.Sir Peter was knighted in 1994. "

2015-05-19,PM will 'look at' powers proposals,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32746049,"David Cameron has said he would ""look at"" any proposals for further powers for Scotland but wants to get the Smith Commission plans implemented first.The prime minister was speaking after meeting Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon in Edinburgh.Mr Cameron said he made a ""commitment"" to include a devolution bill in the Queen's Speech later this month.Ms Sturgeon argued the Smith Commission proposals were ""a good starting point"" but did not go far enough.The prime minister has pledged to include a bill on devolution in this month's Queen's Speech which would be based on the cross-party Smith Commission agreement. The Smith proposals included giving Holyrood the power to set income tax rates and bands, as well as control over a share of VAT and some welfare benefits. But Ms Sturgeon's SNP also wants the Scottish Parliament to be given powers over business taxes, employment law, the minimum wage and additional powers over welfare.Speaking after meeting Ms Sturgeon, Mr Cameron told the BBC: ""Let's make sure Smith is implemented in full. I'm going to keep the commitment I made to the people of Scotland. Let's get that done first because it does create a really strong Scottish Parliament.""He added: ""Of course, if people want to make future proposals I'll look at them.""The prime minister again said he did not support full fiscal autonomy for Scotland - the responsibility for all areas of tax and spending except defence and foreign affairs - stating that it would mean £7bn of cuts or extra tax-raising.What Nicola Sturgeon is trying to say is she has a mandate. She has 56 out of the 59 MPs elected in Scotland and she won 50% of the vote - unprecedented here in Scotland.She says that gives her leverage to push David Cameron. David Cameron says he wants to keep the nation together.The language coming out of Westminster last week was very much a cordial one. 'We will listen'.Nicola Sturgeon has warned him that if he doesn't listen, then the people of Scotland will judge him accordingly.Ms  Sturgeon described the hour-long talks at her official residence at Bute House as ""constructive and business-like"". She said Mr Cameron had made a ""commitment"" that the Smith proposals would be implemented ""as agreed"".""But secondly the prime minister agreed that he would look at proposals that we would now send to suggest the areas we can go beyond Smith,"" Ms Sturgeon said.""There was no agreement in terms of the substance of that but we will submit those proposals, the prime minister has said they will consider them and there will be a meeting to look at how we take that further forward.""Referring to her party's success in last week's general election, which saw the SNP win 56 out of 59 Scottish seats, Ms Sturgeon said: ""People in Scotland have now voted fairly convincingly for the SNP and sent a message that we want the Smith Commission proposals to go further and be built on.""The ball is in his court but I'm going into this in good faith.""She added: ""David Cameron and I are a world apart politically but, where we can, I'm determined to do business in the interests of the people of Scotland and across the UK.""She said she would have a ""constructive and business-like"" relationship with the prime minister. The two leaders shook hands on the front steps of Bute House as Mr Cameron arrived. Mr Cameron left the building shortly before 11:00, almost an hour after he had arrived.The two sides agreed to hold more regular discussions in the future, possibly quarterly. "
2015-05-19,Umunna withdraws Labour leader bid,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32748106,"Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna has withdrawn from the Labour party leadership contest, just days after throwing his hat into the ring.The MP, 36, said in a statement that he was not comfortable with the level of pressure and scrutiny that came with being a leadership candidate.Mr Umunna also cited concerns about the impact of the bid on his family.BBC political editor Nick Robinson said the MP's team insisted no ""unwelcome press story"" lay behind the move.But Mr Umunna had been shocked by the level of scrutiny of himself, his mother, sister and girlfriend, he said.You can follow the latest reaction here.A rising star of the party, Mr Umunna was first elected to Parliament in 2010 before joining the shadow cabinet.He confirmed his candidacy for the Labour leadership via a post on his Facebook page on 12 May, saying the party under Ed Miliband had failed to appeal to enough voters in England.But on Friday he said he had not found the leadership bid to be ""a comfortable experience"".I understand that Chuka Umunna has told friends that ""this is not right for me or people close to me. I'm human, the rest of my life is more important to me than politics.""The shadow business secretary has been distressed by the degree of scrutiny he, his family and his girlfriend have come under since he declared his intention to stand for the labour leadership.I am told that this includes reporters waiting outside the houses of relatives late at night.Friends of Mr Umunna deny that he is nervous of not getting the support of enough MPs to run for the leadership; they point out that he already has half the necessary names and that there are some weeks to go.The shadow business secretary now wants to play a leading role in arguing that Britain should stay in the EU and does not rule out seeking the leadership in the future.He said he thought he had understood ""the scrutiny and attention a leadership contest would bring"", but added: ""However, since the night of our defeat last week I have been subject to the added level of pressure that comes with being a leadership candidate.""The shadow business secretary said he had wondered if it was too soon for him to stand for the leadership, and ""I fear it was."" He also cited concerns about the impact on ""the rest of one's life"" and those close to him.""Consequently, after further reflection, I am withdrawing my candidacy,"" he said.Mr Umunna said he would continue to serve as shadow business secretary and hoped to ""play a leading role"" in Labour's campaign to keep the UK in the EU during the forthcoming in/out referendum.Commenting on the news, Labour former culture secretary Ben Bradshaw - who is expected to run for deputy leader - said Mr Umunna was a ""terrible loss"" to the field.He told the BBC's Daily Politics the Streatham MP had been the candidate the Conservative Party ""feared the most"".""And if it's the result of pressure on an extended family or an extended group of friends, I think that's a very sad reflection on our political culture,"" he said.Chuka Umunna feels ""liberated"", he told me, by his decision to quit the Labour leadership race.He hopes to be given a good role (shadow chancellor, I wonder?) by whoever becomes Labour leader. And I expect he'll become very high profile in the campaign to keep Britain in Europe, which is increasingly looking like it will be next May.He'll endorse a candidate in the next four weeks before nominations close. It will be very interesting to see who he piles in behind.Read more from Allegra (see post 13.23).Former Labour leader Lord Kinnock said he thought Mr Umunna had made the right decision.He said: ""If he felt in his soul that he wasn't prepared to subject himself - and more importantly his family - to the kind of attention which is fairly typical, sadly, these days, he has done absolutely the right thing.""There is no point at all in inflicting avoidable, unnecessary misery on those you love most.""Leadership contender Mary Creagh said she had ""huge respect"" for Mr Umunna, telling BBC Radio 4's World at One programme it took ""courage"" to withdraw from the leadership race.Mr Umunna was ""a big beast"" and would play a ""big role"" in the future of the Labour Party, she added.Yvette Cooper, Andy Burnham, Liz Kendall and Mary Creagh have already thrown their hats into the ring for Labour's top job while a number of other potential candidates, including Dan Jarvis, Alan Johnson and David Lammy, have ruled themselves out. Candidates must secure nominations from 34 colleagues - 15% of the party's MPs - by 15 June to make it on to ballot papers, which will be sent to members in August ahead of the leader's election a month later."

However, Mr Justice Stuart Smith at Southwark Crown Court said there was a ""very strong likelihood"" a custodial sentence would follow.The jury heard how Mote submitted numerous false expenses claims for payment for work that organisations had allegedly carried out on his behalf.Mote claimed the money was to pay whistleblowers in cash through third parties. He also said he had been ""targeted for being an anti-EU MEP.""During his time an MEP he also made £250,000 legitimate expenses claims.No date has been set for the sentencing."

2015-05-19,Round-up: BBC experts' analysis,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/election-2015-32650417,"The political future of the United Kingdom has become clearer after the results of the general election emerged around the country.David Cameron says he hopes to govern for all of the UK after the Conservatives took 331 seats - enough to form a slender majority in the Commons.Labour has been all but wiped out by the SNP in Scotland and suffered a disappointing set of results elsewhere, while the Lib Dems are left with just eight MPs after many party heavyweights such as Vince Cable and Danny Alexander lost their seats.So with battles won and lost and the fall-out and celebrations beginning, BBC correspondents examine the implications and challenges that lie ahead for the new government - and for those whose political careers have been ended by voters.No pollster, no pundit, no political leader saw it coming - not even David Cameron himself.Governing parties don't gain seats. Parties that have implemented painful cuts and are promising more certainly don't. Until that is the Conservative Party did - achieving what had seemed to be Mission Impossible - a Tory majority.Until that is David Cameron's personal triumph which triggered the near simultaneous resignation of his three principle opponents - Messrs Miliband, Clegg and Farage.They did so in part because they helped to crush their partners in coalition these last five years - reducing the Liberal Democrat parliamentary party to a size when it can fit into two London taxis and still have two seats to spare.In part because the extraordinary tidal wave of support for the SNP swept dozens of once safe Labour seats away.In part because Nigel Farage persuaded millions to vote for him but secured just one seat - not, though, the one he was standing in.Read more from Nick Robinson hereThe question uppermost in the prime minister's mind as he assembles his new government is how to keep the kingdom united.""Above all I want to bring our country together,"" he revealed after the result, ""to reclaim a mantle we should never have lost - the mantle of one nation, one United Kingdom"".Looking at the political landscape from Land's End today is very different to the view from John O'Groats.A sea of Conservative and Unionist blue dominates the scene across much of England, while a field of SNP nationalist yellow stretches to the horizon and beyond from the north.David Cameron's greatest challenge is to prevent the union he supports being torn apart by mutual resentment - resentment from Scotland at a Westminster government dominated by English Tories, and resentment from England at the preferential treatment people think is being given to the Scots.Those who assumed the future of the Union had been safeguarded by the Scottish referendum must think again.Read more from Mark Easton hereOne thing is rock-solid true: the Conservatives who worked on this campaign are as surprised by the result as the pollsters, pundits, politicians and general population.Maybe they shouldn't be - the economy is in good shape and the Conservatives had incumbency advantage.But when I travelled back from the prime minister's last rally with a group of exhausted Conservative campaign officials it was clear that 290 seats was a hoped-for target.No-one talked about anything over 300 seats, and no-one even mentioned an overall majority.So what special sauce pushed David Cameron into No 10 with a Commons majority?Mr Cameron had two simple messages in the campaign and he rarely veered away from them; the first - the economy is in good shape and the recovery is threatened by Labour. And the second - the SNP would hold a Labour-led government to ransom.Read more from Jonny Dymond hereBrian Taylor, BBC political editor, ScotlandOf all the comments on the overnight apocalypse, undoubtedly the most straightforward came from a defeated Scottish Labour MP.Since there were quite a few of them, let me narrow the focus a little. Come on down, Tom Harris.Mr Harris had plainly anticipated defeat. Nonetheless, he looked suitably lugubrious as his fate was confirmed.Why, he was asked eagerly, had Labour lost? ""Because we did not win enough votes.""Psephologically, it is perfect. Complete in itself. Psychologically, it sums up Labour's gloom without descending into subsidiary matters such as leadership, strategy and the rest. As a forward-thinking strategy, it is ideal. Win more votes. Simple.Read more from Brian Taylor hereThis has been an election which may have more profound consequences than almost any in living memory.We now face a generational decision about our future in Europe, with an EU referendum in two years' time almost certain.There will also be serious questions about the future of the Union, following an SNP landslide that has turned Scotland into a virtual one-party state.David Cameron's victory also represents a colossal achievement.Only once before in recent history has an incumbent government increased its majority - and that was Mrs Thatcher in her prime in the 1980s.It is also a significant personal victory for Mr Cameron and a rebuff for those in his party who had become increasingly sceptical about his ability to win.But while it may represent a defeat for those Tories who saw this election as a potential opportunity to rid themselves of David Cameron, he must now govern with a wafer-thin majority.For the SNP, their stunning victory can only increase the pressure on Nicola Sturgeon to include a commitment to a second independence referendum in her party's manifesto for next year's Scottish elections.It is an election which has not just defied all the predictions of the pollsters and pundits - but which may yet prompt the most fundamental re-casting of British politics for a generation.Read more from Norman Smith hereAfter an extraordinary night, some brief conclusions:Read more from James Landale hereIs this the end of the union?That is the question many people will be asking this morning after the party which has fought for Scottish independence for 80 years swept to victory.The answer from the jubilant Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon is a firm ""No"".She insists that her MPs will speak for all of Scotland, not just for the 45% who voted for the country to leave the United Kingdom last September.In the closing hours of the most extraordinary election campaign which anyone in Scotland can remember, Ms Sturgeon turned to talk of ""legitimacy.""That will be her watchword in the coming days as she argues that the prime minister cannot ignore the democratic will of the Scottish people.Politically, Scotland and England this morning look and feel like very different countries.Read more from James Cook hereAfter weeks of chatter about an election too close to call, it wasn't that close at all.David Cameron will be continuing as our prime minister.So, what is all this likely to mean?A referendum on whether the UK stays in, or leaves, the European Union, within the next two-and-a-half years.A race to be the next leader of the Labour Party.A race to be the next leader of the Liberal Democrats.And a huge new presence of Scottish National Party MPs at Westminster.And so here's another thing we know for certain this morning: Politics ain't going to be boring any time soon.Read more from Chris Mason hereFor Labour the story of their terrible night is rapidly turning into the search for a new leader. So who will that be?Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, is almost certain to run.  Even before this election, both he and another almost inevitable candidate, Chuka Umunna, had raised eyebrows inside the party at the work they had put in, preparing the ground with members and the unions for potential bids.Yvette Cooper, before the election, was still thought not to have made up her mind over whether to run. That decision has been made perhaps a little easier as her husband, Ed Balls, has lost his seat.She is certainly potentially in the frame, along with two lesser known names - Liz Kendall and Dan Jarvis - two MPs who were only elected in 2010 for the first time. This could be their moment. But whoever is in the job, they face a monumental task.Read Laura Kuenssberg's Twitter hereSterling is up (the most for seven years against the euro), share prices are up (especially bank shares like Lloyds and RBS, and energy shares such as Centrica), government bond prices are up.To state the obvious, investors love the Tories' general election victory.There are a few reasons.One (no surprise here) is that Labour's threat of breaking up banks and imposing energy price caps has been lifted.Second is that investors have been discounting days and weeks of wrangling after polling day over who would form the government - and so they are semi-euphoric that we already know who's in charge.Third, many investors tend to be economically conservative and instinctively Conservative.But although the City may be a bit drunk on the result, its pleasure in Ed Miliband's and Ed Balls' humiliation may be making it a bit blind - perhaps dangerously so - to some bumps in the economic road ahead.Read more from Robert Peston hereNigel Farage dreamed of holding the balance of power, but in the end his UKIP party is now worse off than when it came into the election.At the seventh time of asking he was rejected - this time by the people of Thanet South. It was a similar story in Rochester and Strood where Mark Reckless, who sensationally defected from the Tories last year, was also sent packing.In seats on UKIP's target list, like Thurrock in Essex, the party failed to make gains. In Grimsby - where Mr Farage went twice in the last six weeks - they came third.UKIP got around four million votes - with especially strong showings in north-east and south-east England - but it's ended up with just one MP, and a vacancy at the top. This has led to UKIP attacking the current system of choosing MPs, which it's described as ""busted"" and ""dysfunctional"".In one sense, this campaign was a complete failure and it's left an aftermath of angry voters, and others wondering if the UKIP bubble has burst.Read Robin Brant's Twitter hereI monitored 91 GB-wide voting intention polls during the 2015 election campaign and found nothing in them to prepare me for the final outcome.The good news for the pollsters was that their share for the Lib Dems was pretty close, as were the shares for UKIP, the Greens and the catch-all category of Others.The bad news for the polling industry was that the crucial shares for Conservative and Labour were the ones where they came most adrift.When all the qualifications of margins of error are allowed, there did appear to be a systematic overstatement of the Labour share and an equally systematic understatement of the Conservative one.It is for the pollsters to decide whether to conduct a review of their performance but I trust they will avoid the initial knee-jerk reaction of the immediate aftermath of the 1992 polls debacle.This general election performance follows the performance of the polls in the 2014 Scottish referendum where the choice was simply binary and yet all the polls were out by between 4-6%.Something is wrong. A lot of us would like to know what it is.Read more from David Cowling hereThe words ""political earthquake"" have been translated into numerous European languages, making front page news across the continent.While Britons now examine the domestic minutiae of the election result, here in mainland Europe the vote means one thing: a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU. And that has the potential to create an earthquake of its own.The guardian of the EU treaties Mr Cameron wants to change - Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker - has said again he'd listen to what Britain's new government proposed.Read more from Katya Adler here"

2015-05-19,A history of political plots,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32749971,"Nigel Farage has apparently seen off a challenge to his leadership of UKIP - a move described by his former election strategist as a ""coup"". He's not the only party leader to face an attempted ousting. But can you recover from such a revolt?In 2006, the Labour prime minister was the target of what became known as the ""curry house conspiracy"" - a coup to remove him and install his chancellor, Gordon Brown, as prime minister.It would lead to several of the plotters' resignations - but not Mr Blair's. However, it was successful to a degree in that it forced the party leader into naming a departure date.The move against him was reportedly masterminded by Tom Watson, a defence minister at the time, who was also rumoured to have had a secret meeting with Mr Brown on the eve of the revolt.Apparently, Mr Watson and three fellow West Midlands MPs - Sion Simon, David Wright (both ministerial aides) and Khalid Mahmood - met over a biryani at a Wolverhampton curry house to discuss the PM's future, before dispatching a missive calling for him to quit.The letter - which attracted the support of a number of normally loyal Labour MPs - was leaked to the press, and ultimately resulted in Mr Watson's resignation.In his parting letter, the West Bromwich East MP took a shot at the prime minister, who he said should step down in the interests of party and country.Mr Blair denounced his actions and branded the former minister ""disloyal, discourteous and wrong"", saying he would have sacked him if he had not resigned.But Mr Watson's departure was swiftly followed by the resignations of six other junior members of government - who had also signed the rebel letter - in protest at the prime minister's refusal to say when he would step down as Labour leader.The whole affair resulted in Mr Blair announcing his intention to step aside within 12 months - which he duly did, on 27 June 2007.But it did nothing to quash internal dissent and speculation in the party over the future leadership of the party.Labour prime minister Gordon Brown found his leadership under threat in 2009 after one of his cabinet ministers dramatically quit the government and called for him to resign.Work and Pensions Secretary James Purnell - a former aide to Tony Blair - resigned from his post after the polls closed in the local and European elections, in which Labour was forecast to do badly.Explaining his decision to quit, Mr Purnell said the prime minister made a Conservative victory ""more, not less, likely"".It was Mr Brown's first direct challenge from a cabinet minister - but it would not topple the Labour leader as senior members of government refused to follow Mr Purnell's lead.Mr Brown was safe for the time being. But several months later, in January 2010, a fresh leadership challenge was mounted by two senior former Labour cabinet ministers.Geoff Hoon and Patricia Hewitt wrote to all Labour MPs, saying the party was ""deeply divided"" over Mr Brown's leadership and that the best way to resolve the issue was by way of secret ballot.They insisted it was not an ""attempted coup"" but a necessary step to resolve divisions within the party.But the duo could only muster the public support of a handful of backbenchers long-opposed to Mr Brown, with the majority of the party's MPs less than impressed by the move, which came just weeks before the general election.As the day wore on, a succession of cabinet ministers came out to back the PM, suggesting there was little momentum behind the plot - although it was noted that several were not exactly gushing in their support of Mr Brown.As history tells us, neither leadership challenge bore fruit but they reflected the internal doubts and divisions over Mr Brown at the helm.As leadership toppling attempts go, this one in 2014 was regarded as a particularly ""botched"" and ""shambolic coup"". Indeed, former Lib Dem leader Lord (Paddy) Ashdown described the move as a ""plot of deep malice"".Its instigator, Lord (Matthew) Oakeshott - a close ally of the-then Business Secretary Vince Cable - tried to unseat Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg.The peer was found to have commissioned secret polls suggesting the party would do better at the 2015 general election without Mr Clegg in the driving seat.The man Lord Oakeshott had long had in mind to take Mr Clegg's place - Mr Cable, who was on government business in China at the time - was forced to publicly condemn his friend's actions and state his backing for Mr Clegg.But Lord Oakeshott said the business secretary had in fact known about his polls and their findings.Nevertheless, the peer - who was denounced by the Lib Dem leadership for spending money that could have been spent on campaigning - quit the party, and issued a warning shot on his way out about the Lib Dems' future prospects.Mr Cable largely emerged unscathed but he faced questions about his loyalty to the leader. Although the two sought to put paid to reports of a rift with a (painfully awkward, 'nothing to see here, folks') stage-managed pint in a pub.Although the revolt failed, and Mr Clegg remained at the helm, the Lib Dems did go on to suffer a trouncing at the general election, losing nearly 50 of its MPs - one of them, Mr Cable himself - prompting his leader to quit.The Conservatives have a reputation for being more ruthless than their party rivals when it comes to getting rid of leaders they sense are no longer effectual.But, in 1995, Prime Minister John Major - tired of persistent rumours of a leadership challenge - decided to take the bull by the horns and trigger a surprise leadership election to silence his detractors.His own backbenchers had questioned Mr Major's ability to unite and lead the party, which was deeply divided over Europe.So ""put up or shut up"", he told them as he tendered his resignation as Conservative Party leader but not prime minister.But then stepped forward eurosceptic MP John Redwood, who resigned from the cabinet in order to contest Mr Major's leadership.This was unexpected by many, as the PM had said there had been assurances from his cabinet that none would stand against him.But Mr Major went on to win the ensuing election with a comfortable defeat over his challenger, who was not included in the PM's consequent cabinet reshuffle.No further contested leadership election took place until after the Conservatives' defeat at the 1997 general election, paving the way for William Hague to take over the running of the party.Not all attempts to oust a party leader end in failure: as Margaret Thatcher found out to her peril.With three electoral victories under her belt, the Conservative prime minister's downfall would come at the hands of her own party - not the voters.It was on 1 November 1990 when Geoffrey (now Lord) Howe - one of Mrs Thatcher's longest-serving ministers - resigned over differences with the party leader over Europe.In his now infamous speech on the floor of the House of Commons, he attacked the PM's policies and leadership style, comparing being one of her cabinet ministers to opening the batting at cricket only to find his bat had been ""broken... by the team captain"".It sparked the beginning of the end of the 11-year Thatcher reign.Michael (now Lord) Heseltine seized on the opportunity to challenge the prime minister in the ensuing leadership contest, from which she would eventually withdraw and John Major emerge as her successor. Reflecting on the revolt and its implications on the Conservative Party, Baroness Thatcher's biographer Charles Moore wrote: ""Because the coup was unjustified, and so trust broke down, the politics of the next 15 years were those of civil war."""
2015-05-19,Election swings and roundabouts,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-32741924,"If election manifesto claims are all about smoke and mirrors, should we now add swings and roundabouts to the political metaphor?There's an intriguing aspect to the general election results in the Midlands that puzzled me.It's the striking contrast in the swings between Labour and the Conservatives.David Cameron and his campaign strategists knew they were home and dry when Nuneaton was the first Midlands marginal to declare.It was not only a Tory hold but a swing to the Conservatives from Labour of 3%.I was in the Nottingham suburb of Beeston awaiting the result of the Broxtowe count. Would its high profile Conservative MP Anna Soubry survive a red surge?Nuneaton set the pattern. Across the Midlands, both east and west, there was a uniform swing of between three and four per cent to the Tories - Warwickshire North 3%, Amber Valley 4%, Derbyshire South 4% and Sherwood 4%. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan topped the Tory swingometer in the Midlands marginals with 5% in Loughborough.Yet in the big cities, it was a very different story. The swing went to Labour.So in Nottingham East they enjoyed a 6% swing, Nottingham South 5.8%, Leicester South 7.3%, Leicester West 5%, Birmingham Hall Green 12%, Birmingham Hodge Hill 8%.If swings to Labour on this scale had gone beyond the city ring road roundabouts and into the suburbs, Ed Miliband would have become prime minister by now.In confidence, one senior Labour insider in Nottingham told me its success in the city wards was down to organisation, experience and its teams of activists.""We won the ground war. If Nottingham's city boundaries were extended into Sherwood and Broxtowe, we would have won those constituencies as well,"" he told me.Labour leadership candidate, Leicester West's Liz Kendall has identified her party's problem beyond the ring road roundabout.It's about reaching out to Middle England.""We need to show people that we understand their aspirations and ambitions for the future,"" she told the Sunday Times.The problem for Labour was that Middle England was not interested in what the party offered…and still isn't. The Cameron brand worked its magic in those Midlands marginals... it'll take something or someone special to break up that ballot box relationship."
2015-05-19,Royal 'lobbying',https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32740154,"Prince Charles sent 27 letters to then Prime Minister Tony Blair and members of his government between September 2004 and March 2005, ""despite the Freedom of Information Act!"" as the prince joked in one.But did his suggestions and concerns have any bearing on the behaviour of Mr Blair's government?The request: Prince Charles expresses his worries over an EU directive on complementary medicines ""which is… effectively outlawing the use of certain herbal extracts"".  Mr Blair replied, offering moral support and practical help. He agreed that ""the implementation as it is currently planned is crazy"" and set out an action plan that included delaying implementation for all existing products to 2011. What happened: Herbal products were not required to be authorised until 2011, just as Mr Blair had promised. Prince Charles continues to sell his own brand of complementary products, Duchy Herbals, through Boots and Waitrose. The request: Writing to Mr Blair, the prince expresses a ""growing sense of anxiety"" that the Hill Farming Allowance, which supports farmers working on Britain's uplands, could be scrapped. In his reply, the prime minister said he understood that the Hill Farm Allowance would continue until 2007. What happened: The allowance lasted until the end of Labour's tenure in 2010, when it was abolished.The request: Just 18 months after the US-led invasion of Iraq, Prince Charles raised the issue of poor performance of Lynx helicopters in high temperatures, saying: ""I fear that this is just one more example of where our Armed Forces are being asked to do an extremely challenging job (particularly in Iraq) without the necessary resources.""Mr Blair replied: ""On the subject of the Lynx helicopter, the limitations of the existing platform, particularly in the extremely challenging environment within Iraq, are well recognised by the Ministry of Defence."" He added that replacement of the helicopters would be a priority. What happened: Mr Blair's comments go much further than what he was saying about the subject at the time. In the event, though, the fleet was not fully upgraded until 2011.The request: Prince Charles lamented that the government's TB prevention plans might not ""include a commitment to deal with the badger problem in the immediate future"" and pushed strongly for a cull, saying: ""All I can say is that I do urge you to look again at introducing a proper cull of badgers where it is necessary.""Mr Blair sympathised, saying he could ""personally see the case for culling badgers"". However, he was unwilling to commit to a cull.  What happened: Culling trials were conducted from 1998-2005. The final results, published in 2008, said that the badger cull could ""make no meaningful contribution"" to curbing bovine TB. It wasn't until 2013 that a full culling programme began in two pilot areas. These ended with the conclusion that the pilots had been neither humane nor effective at curbing the spread of TB.The request: Then Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell wrote to Prince Charles to say she had decided to give parts of the historic Smithfield meat market Grade II listed status, and was trying to persuade deputy prime minister John Prescott to ""call in"" the planning application to prevent demolition of other parts of the site. She had been swayed by evidence provided by Sir Neil Cossons, who was English Heritage chair at the time, after he had been asked by the prince to add his support. Prince Charles replied that he was ""extremely glad to read of your appreciation of the value of this group of buildings"". According to the Guardian, market workers desperate to see the redevelopment of the site invited the prince to meet them to discuss it, but his office said he was ""unlikely to accept as he did not want to interfere in the planning process"".What happened: Smithfield market is still the subject of planning battles a decade on. Successive planning applications have been refused by ministers. Last year then Communities Secretary Eric Pickles rejected plans for an office development on the site, stating that ""the extent of damage that the application would cause to the important heritage assets at Smithfield runs entirely counter to national and policy objectives intended to protect such assets from harm"".In March, the Museum of London announced a move from its current Barbican site to the Smithfield market building."
2015-05-19,Election fallout,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32703139,"""Some of those gimmicks - that tombstone, whatever idiot thought that up I do not know!""I was talking to the former Mayor of Crawley in Sussex, John Mortimer, in the town's Labour Supporters Club about the vexed question of what went wrong, and where Labour should go next. This seat is one of those southern seats Labour hoped to take, but failed.I hear a whole range of views in the club.""They didn't give nothing to depend on, they should be clear, and a little bit more down to Earth."" ""Good party, wrong leader, they don't look after business enough.""Councillor John Stanley tells me: ""I think in a way we did go too left, but now we can go a bit centre-left, or centre, depending who the new leader is.""The former mayor sums up the mood on the doorstep: ""Whatever we told them, they didn't believe us.""  Expect to hear all those views, and more, in the coming leadership contest. Step back from the angst of supporters, and it may not be that hard to see why Labour failed.  An economic recovery, hailed by independent organisations as the result of government policy, undid a party that had loudly proclaimed for five years that the coalition's policies would lead to economic disaster. Combine that with an uncharismatic and uninspirational leader, then you might argue no further debate is necessary.Fat chance of that. Defeat breeds resentment, and this one has opened up old divisions.  A chorus of Blairties, led by the man himself, has declared that Ed's problem was ignoring those with aspiration and ambition, failing to appeal to those running business. Incidentally, I've been ticked off by the perspicacious editor of the New Statesman, Jason Cowley, for using the ""unhelpful"" term ""Blairites"".I can't think of another description that fits Tony, Lord Mandelson, Lord Adonis and David Miliband quite so well. But call them what you will, the message was clear - Ed was too left wing, Labour should move back to the centre, or, if you like, to the right.Reading Mr Blair's pithy analysis, listening to Lord Mandelson's gripping and savage eloquence, describing a party sent out to shout: ""We love the poor and hate the rich,"" and so ignoring the middle, and you realise strong emotions are in play.But back to the future may not be sufficient. Of course elections are won on the centre ground. But grandees grinding axes, affronted by the failure of boys who used to make their tea, may be creating so much noise that they can't hear more insistent sounds.  For there are several elephants trumpeting loudly as they cram into the small space of the shadow cabinet room. Imagine these beasts are as gaily decorated as Berlin buddy bears. One is decked out in red, another in imperial purple bunting, and another, a mammoth, strong tusked and ice rimmed, painted yellow with tartan trimmings.Take the last first. The Scottish wipeout is Labour's biggest problem. Fail to solve it, and Labour can forget ever having a comfortable majority again. It is hard to argue Labour were wiped out in Scotland because the SNP outflanked them to the right with their appeal to the business community and the ambitious and aspirational. But it is true the SNP drew in to people from left, right and centre, just as the modernisers say Labour should. It was the politics of economic self-interest, but cast in a very different light. Tribally sneering at ""the reactionary ideology of nationalism"" as Mr Blair does, will not reach the central belt of Scotland, the middle ground of  Midlothian.What about that purple pachyderm?  In Crawley - in fact in seat after seat - there is a similar pattern.  Labour did, in fact, often increase the size of their vote. So did the Conservatives, usually by a bit more. But the real dynamic was the total collapse of the Lib Dems and the dramatic rise of UKIP. The increase in votes for Nigel Farage's party wasn't translated into parliamentary seats, but, although it is early days in terms of research, it probably hurt Labour a lot. If we believe - and I do - Matthew Goodwin and Rob Ford, authors of Revolt on the Right, these voters are often former Labour supporters - older, less educated, those left behind on the tides of  globalisation, stranded on the shores of post-industrialisation. They may have had too many disappointments to feel much ambition or aspiration. They are a challenge for Labour, and any new leader will spend a good deal of time thinking how to deal with the concerns of Europe and immigration.Whether to share their fears, or confront them will be a big decision.Which brings us to Red Nellie. Those members who still proudly call themselves socialist. This is not about Old Labour - they are more likely to be baristas or barristers than boilermakers. It is easy as an outsider, as a journalist, to treat politics as an intellectual game about how best to win power - but many people, particularly the foot soldiers, particularly after the death of  purely tribal loyalties, are in it because they passionately believe in winning  power to do something specific.Many of them are suspicious of the later incarnations of New Labour, not because it reached an accommodation with wealth and business, but because it seemed to worship at the same altar, to regard the party's core beliefs in redistribution and equality as childish fantasies from a past age.Perhaps to Mr Blair, they are the problem, people who may equate ""ambition"" with greed. They might point out that a man who claims to be worth ""only"" £20m may find it harder than most to squeeze through the eye of a needle to understand their point of view. Most successful Labour leaders will confront the left at some point, but the concerns of this group go to the existential question ""What is the party for?""This is not a polemic - not an argument about what should be done, but a reflection on the complex conundrums that will face any new Labour leader, the tearing apart of the old alliance that made up a Labour majority, and so the political need to satisfy groups with very different, indeed, contradictory demands. But looking for a Social Democratic universal theory of everything may be missing the point. What the party desperately wants is a leader who can pull the disparate threads together and articulate them as common purpose. Whether she or he exists is another matter.Much more on that in the coming months."
2015-05-19,'Take us with you',https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-32736153,"Thousands of people in the north of England have been using the hashtag ""take us with you Scotland"" to express their upset about the result of last week's general election, and Scottish nationalists are welcoming this English minority with open arms. Last Thursday's general election was a rough one for the Labour Party in its traditional stronghold in the north of England. But further to the north, the left-leaning Scottish National Party won nearly every seat it contested. That political contrast has made some left-wing voters in places like Manchester, Leeds and Sheffield look fondly on their neighbours. Since last Thursday's election in Britain the phrase ""take us with you Scotland"" has been used more than 24,000 times. ""Genuinely beginning to wonder if the North of England becoming a part of Scotland would be better for us, I really am,"" tweeted Aaron Miller from Yorkshire. Some cracked jokes under the tag after the North West Motorway Police account, which gives traffic updates, announced that they had ""picked up a pedestrian on the M62 who was trying to walk to Scotland.""After an initial spike of jokes over the weekend, the hashtag really took off when users start to mobilise in support of around a year-old petition on the campaigning site Change.org. The petition calls for the north of England to secede from the rest of the country and join up with Scotland, and more than 12,000 people have signed it.Its creator, a Sheffield resident who calls himself ""Stu Dent"", set it up to coincide with last year's Scottish independence referendum, and he also created a map imagining the boundary of a ""Scotland plus the north"" country.Stu Dent runs the Twitter account Hunters Bar, named after an area of southwest Sheffield which is very popular with - you guessed it - students. Despite the account having thousands of followers on Twitter, when the map was first posted last year, the image was shared only about 100 times - however, in the past week it's been retweeted by thousands. Stu Dent told BBC Trending that he was surprised at how popular his idea has become. ""In hindsight, perhaps I shouldn't have been,"" he said. ""There is a huge frustration in parts of the UK about the things that have happened since 2010.""""I think people need a place to go where they can say 'not in my name! This is not the England I want',"" he added. But in addition to disappointment from some quarters about the election result, there might be another reason why the petition is getting a boost now: the power of the Scottish Nationalists on Twitter. What started as a post-election joke in the North of England was quickly embraced by the so-called ""Cyber Nats"" - and a trend was born.The SNP's social media strategist Ross Colquhoun expressed the party's mood about the hashtag best, in a post which was shared more than 500 times. ""2014: #LetsStayTogether 2015: #TakeUsWithYouScotland What a difference a year makes"" he tweeted.Blog by Hannah HendersonNext story: The sport reporter and the obscene ranter who lost his jobFollow BBC Trending on Twitter @BBCtrending, and find us on Facebook."
2015-05-19,What Britain wants from Europe,https://web.archive.org//web/20150517032831/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32695399,"David Cameron says he has a mandate to pursue EU reform following the Conservatives' general election victory. The PM, who will be hoping his majority government will give him extra leverage in Brussels, wants to renegotiate the terms of the UK's membership ahead of a referendum by the end of 2017. He has said he will campaign for Britain to remain in the EU if he gets the reforms he wants.Mr Cameron has said he does not want to reveal full details of his negotiating hand but he has given a broad indication, in a series of speeches and newspaper articles, of his priorities when he goes into talks with other EU leaders.These are: The prime minister has said Britain would resist any move towards a European Army and that he wants to free British police forces from EU interference. He has also ruled out Britain joining the euro.But he has placed less emphasis in recent years on demanding changes to EU social policy, such as the maximum 48-hour working week, agency workers, maternity leave and non-discrimination rules.The official UK government position is that a referendum will be held by the end of 2017 but Downing Street sources have said: ""If we can do it earlier we will.""There is speculation David Cameron is planning to hold the vote in 2016 to avoid a clash with French and German elections in 2017.The prime minister wants treaty change but even if the referendum was held in 2017 there may not be enough time to legally incorporate any reforms into a treaty and it would have to be done at a later stage.An early referendum would anger Eurosceptics who believe it would not allow enough time to make the case for exit or negotiate any meaningful concessions.""A rushed process would severely undermine the chances to secure a significant deal that both British business and voters could support and would waste the opportunity of a lifetime,"" Matthew Elliott, chief executive of Business for Britain told Breitbart London.The question is always crucial in any referendum and there is already a debate about what it should be. The Draft European Union (Referendum) Bill, published by the Conservatives in 2013, proposed this form of words: ""Do you think that the United Kingdom should remain a member of the European Union?""Some thought that leaned too far towards the status quo, encouraging a yes vote, and the Electoral Commission said it was not clear and direct enough. The watchdog proposed this form of words instead: ""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union?""The new Conservative government will attempt to repeal the Human Rights Act, which requires UK courts to treat the European Court of Human Rights as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. The European Court of Human Rights is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe (CoE), which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine.The freedom for people to move around Europe, enshrined in the EU treaties, works in parallel with the other three basic freedoms in the single market: freedom of goods, capital and services.It is likely to be a ""red line"" for other EU leaders, who do not want to see it eroded.Mr Cameron has steered clear of tackling it directly - for example by asking for an emergency ""brake"" on free movement, or a cap on numbers - focusing instead on reducing the incentive provided by welfare payments. In a speech last November, David Cameron set out measures to reduce the number of EU nationals moving to the UK.His main proposals were:Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission, has said he is ready to work with Mr Cameron to ""strike a fair deal for the United Kingdom in the EU"". The leaders of other EU nations have previously warned they are unlikely to support major changes to EU treaties to accommodate British demands. But Mr Cameron's general election victory may have given him extra leverage. ""The ball is very much in the court of the UK now,"" a senior EU official told The Guardian. ""It's up to the British to define what they want."" The key figure will be German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is very keen to keep Britain in the EU but has so far been unwilling to make major concessions to enable that to happen. There are fears that a ""pick and mix"" approach to EU treaties would undermine EU cohesion.Mr Cameron has said there is ""no doubt"" his planned reforms will require changes to the treaties governing the European Union. But this would require the unanimous support of all EU members, and may not be possible within the deadline he has set of a referendum before the end of 2017. Any attempt to change EU laws on free movement would meet fierce resistance from some EU nations, particularly Eastern European states. Mr Juncker has said free movement is non-negotiable.Mr Cameron may find it difficult to get unanimous support for his proposals for a four-year waiting period for migrant workers claiming UK benefits. East European EU members would be likely to oppose this, on the grounds that it would discriminate against their citizens.  Attempts to secure opt-outs for the City are unlikely to go down well with other European leaders.However, there are precedents for EU treaty changes to accommodate some countries' specific concerns - for example, the protocol attached to the Lisbon Treaty for Ireland.Mr Cameron has faced repeated calls to say whether he would campaign for Britain's exit from the EU in the referendum if he fails to get what he wants from the renegotiation process. All he has said is that he will ""rule nothing out"". Some Conservative MPs want Britain to leave the EU no matter what David Cameron manages to renegotiate. A larger group are likely to want more concessions than Mr Cameron has so far indicated he is prepared to demand.Senior backbencher David Davis, who was defeated by Mr Cameron for the Tory leadership in 2005, told the Daily Telegraph the majority of the 332 Conservative MPs want Mr Cameron to negotiate an ""opt-out"" power to stop individual EU laws from applying to Britain. The prime minister has said this would be ""impossible"" without Britain leaving the EU.Mr Davis claims as many as 60 Tory MPs would be prepared to rebel and vote for Britain's exit from the EU if the prime minister fails to deliver.Graham Brady, chairman of the Tory backbench 1922 committee, which represents backbenchers, has urged David Cameron to give all Conservative MPs, including ministers, a free vote in the EU referendum.In January, Mr Cameron warned that serving cabinet ministers would have to quit the government if they wanted to campaign to leave the EU if he had secured the reforms to it he wants.In the 1975 referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Economic Community, as the EU was then called, Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson decided to suspend collective responsibility because his cabinet was split on the issue. Ministers were allowed to vote with their consciences and campaign against each other. The majority of them, including Mr Wilson, joined the Yes camp, but left-wingers, such as Tony Benn, played a leading role in the No campaign. The Yes campaign won easily with 67% of the vote."

2015-05-20,PM announces freeze in ministers' pay,https://web.archive.org//web/20150524033726/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32863296,"Government ministers' pay will remain frozen for the next five years, David Cameron has announcedWriting in the Sunday Times, the prime minister said we were ""all in this together"" when it came to paying off the national debt.His pledge will save about £800,000 a year and £4m by 2020.The decision means ministerial pay will not have risen for a decade by the end of parliament. Cabinet ministers currently receive a salary of £134,565.This includes their pay as MPs. The prime minister is paid a total of £142,500.Mr Cameron said his decision to freeze ministerial pay for the duration of the parliament was part of his ""One Nation"" approach to tackling the deficit, and becoming a country where ""all hard-working people can get on"".He writes: ""We can't pretend there's not still a long way to go. We've halved the deficit as a share of the economy - but there's still half of it left to pay off.""So we will continue to take the difficult decisions necessary to bring spending down and secure our economy. As we go about doing that, I want people to be in no doubt: I said five years ago we were all in this together, and five years on, nothing has changed.""That's why, for example, I've decided to freeze the pay of the ministers in the government. For me, that's just one step which sends out a clear signal: that as we continue knuckling down as a country, we will all play our part.""Meanwhile, the UK's 650 MPs - who are currently paid £67,060 - are in line for a 9% pay rise later this year after the independent watchdog - known as the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA) -  said pay should rise to £74,000 after the election.Changes brought in after the 2009 expenses scandal mean MPs are no longer in charge of setting their own pay rates, instead this issue now falls within the purview of IPSA.But the government has made it clear that the scale of the IPSA's suggested increase is ""not right"" and should be reconsidered, given that public sector pay rises have been capped at 1%.Is this a surprise? No. Will it save much money? No. Is it symbolically important to the point that it would have been more newsworthy if they'd not done this? Absolutely. The prime minister acknowledges that there are ""difficult decisions"" to come, so this is important symbolically to try to prove, as he puts it, that ""we are all in this together."" What is likely to prove much more tricky is the expected big rise coming soon in the basic pay all MPs receive.After the expenses scandal, parliament decided MPs' pay should be set by an independent body. But always beware the law of unintended consequences: that body could now recommend, against the vociferous protests of the party leaders, a big hike in their pay packets.MPs are also not paid extra for their committee work, although committee chairs get a £14,000 supplement, taking their pay to £81,642.Ahead of Wednesday's Queen's Speech setting out his priorities for the first year of his new term, Mr Cameron used his newspaper column to insist that his new administration would be ""about so much more than balancing the books"".""As we return to office, after five years of a long-term economic plan and sacrifices by the British people, we're on the brink of something different - something special,"" he writes.""We can become a country where all hard-working people can get on; not a two-speed society where some can afford childcare and homes of their own and others cannot.""We can become a country where all children get the education they deserve and no-one settles for a life on benefits; so no-one's background is a barrier to their success.""In other words, we can become One Nation."""
2015-05-20,Cameron urged to make case for EU,https://web.archive.org//web/20150524033726/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32857711,"David Cameron is being urged to make a positive case for Europe if he wants to successfully renegotiate the UK's terms of membership with fellow EU leaders.Pascal Lamy, one of Europe's most senior politicians, told the BBC other leaders wanted to help Mr Cameron win a referendum but he has to help himself.Mr Lamy was director general of the World Trade Organization for 13 years.The PM has pledged to renegotiate a ""better deal"" for the UK and hold an ""in-out"" referendum by the end of 2017.Meanwhile, the Labour Party's acting leader Harriet Harman has said her party has officially dropped its opposition to holding a referendum on the issue.In an interview to be broadcast on BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend later, Mr Lamy - who now heads up the think tank Notre Europe - said he did not agree with the view ""that the Brits have always been a pain in the ass so they can leave and it would be fine"". He said the prime minister started with some credit because of his election victory.""[David Cameron] won an election in a reasonably brilliant way as a politician, as a professional of politics he did a good job and these guys are in the same job and they recognise that"", he said.""There are issues of substance, but the psychology of that matters very much.""  He warned there would be some red lines, such as free movement of people but there was a ""margin of manoeuvre"" over this and exempting the UK from ""ever closer union"". He suggested Mr Cameron's tone would be important.""Most European leaders, including myself, feel David Cameron needs to be able to make a good case for Europe in the referendum.""They need to help them but he himself must make a pro-EU case in the UK, which frankly hasn't been done for the last 15 years.""There has to be some change to the UK narrative, which will probably be the price for a compromise."" Mr Lamy said if Britain left, it would be bad news for the EU. He said in his previous jobs, he found world leaders, like the presidents of China and Brazil, felt the EU was founded on two miracles - peace between France and Germany, and British membership.""Half of the miracle would evaporate if the Brits were to leave the European Union,"" he added.On Friday, the prime minister admitted he has not found himself surrounded by a ""wall of love"", as he put it - but he will find Europe's leaders are willing to help him construct a ladder to hop over the high fence he has built for himself.Labour's Harriet Harman has also said her party would now support David Cameron's planned referendum bill, clearing a path for a ballot by the end of 2017.Writing in the Sunday Times, Ms Harman said: ""We have now had a general election and reflected on the conversations we had on doorsteps throughout the country. The British people want to have a say on the UK's membership of the European Union. ""Labour will therefore now support the EU referendum bill when it comes before the House of Commons.""But she added that although her party was no longer opposing a referendum, Labour would still be campaigning for the UK to remain part of the union.As a high profile, fervent believer in European integration Mr Pascal's words are important - and suggest the European establishment want to give Mr Cameron a deal that will help him win a referendum.If Mr Cameron failed it would inflict a grave, potentially fatal, wound on a project already under assault from numerous directions. They will have their own red lines of course, but Mr Cameron's biggest problem may well come at home. He faces Goldilocks' porridge problem - what is suitable to sup for European leaders may prove too tepid for backbenchers. What is the right temperature for them, is likely to burn lips on the continent. Seeking a deal that is ""just right"" will not be easy.David Cameron is ready to start renegotiating the terms of Britain's EU membership ahead of a referendum.

In that time he learned his brief, gained the ­experience, handled the media and won the public's trust with an overwhelming landslide.""I have seen a lot of those skills and ­qualities in Andy Burnham during his 13 years as an MP.""Many people talk about aspiration but Andy is a living example - a working-class lad from Liverpool who went to a ­comprehensive and got a place at Cambridge University. ""Andy also has that one thing all leaders crave - the common touch. ""I've seen him in small groups and big meetings. People instantly warm to the guy.

2015-05-20,Apprenticeship system 'fails young',https://web.archive.org//web/20150524033726/http://www.bbc.com/news/education-32844164,"The apprenticeship system in Britain is ""failing"" and needs reform to address youth unemployment, a new report says. The study, commissioned by the Local Government Association, found 42% of all apprenticeships created in the last five years went to people aged over 25.It said current policy enabled businesses to train established workers rather than unemployed young people.The government said the number of young people not in work, education or training was at its lowest in a decade.It has pledged to create a further three million apprenticeships before the end of Parliament in 2020.   The report, by the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) and the Local Government Association (LGA), found 67% of intermediate-skilled apprentices were already employed by their company when they were given their apprenticeships. The study also said demand for apprenticeships - particularly among young people - had soared, with one million people applying for 85,000 vacancies last year.This was despite two million apprenticeships starting over the last Parliament, the report said. In 2013-14 under-19s applied for 57% of the advertised apprenticeships but were given 27% of them, whereas over-25s made up 7% of applications but filled 37% of the vacancies. The study's authors said the government needed to undertake ""significant reform"" of the apprenticeship system, which they said was ""failing to get to grips with stubbornly high levels of youth unemployment"".Luke Raikes, research fellow at IPPR North, said: ""A high quality apprenticeship system could be used to combat youth unemployment and drive higher productivity, but the system we currently have is failing to deliver.""There is a big gap between the function apprenticeships should have in our economy and how they're being used in practice: the majority of apprenticeships are being used to train older people, and those who are already employed at their company, instead of taking on young people out of work.""Just over a third of apprenticeships created in the last five years were at advanced or higher level, with the majority of places being at the intermediate level.And 24% of 16-18 year olds, and 15% of all intermediate apprentices were not being paid the minimum wage, the report said. Pay was particularly low in hairdressing and childcare, where 42% and 26% of apprentices were paid less than the minimum wage. The report said local apprenticeship hubs should be created and given full control of the apprenticeship grant from central government. This would enable employers to tailor the apprenticeship offer to better meet the needs of local employers and the local economy, it said.Powers and budgets for apprenticeships should also be further devolved to local authorities.   Cllr Peter Box, economy spokesman for the LGA, said: ""A good apprenticeship can give young people the experience, skills and understanding that can often lead straight into a full-time job. ""At present, too many new apprenticeships are low skilled and taken by older people already in work with their employer."""

First of all we'd ask why do we pay these people to react rather than pre-empt massive outcomes. Secondly it might have already been too late.  There might have been a huge sell-off in sterling. Government bonds - known as gilts - might have plunged in value, meaning the cost of borrowing for the Treasury might have soared overnight.Britain's major listed companies might have seen billions wiped off their value in early trading.Of course none of that might happen. Markets might have been very sanguine about quitting the EU. But we don't know and the only way the Bank of England would know was if it did some quiet preparatory work - outside the glare of publicity.That latter hope is now forlorn.The email, from Sir Jon Cunliffe's private secretary to four senior executives, was written on 21 May, the Guardian reported.James Talbot, the head of the monetary assessment and strategy division, was also involved in Project Bookend, the paper said.The email is quoted as saying: ""Jon's proposal, which he has asked me to highlight to you, is that no email is sent to James's team or more broadly around the Bank about the project.""James can tell his team that he is working on a short-term project on European economics in International [division] which will last a couple of months. This will be in-depth work on a broad range of European economic issues. Ideally he would then say no more.""The memo goes on to propose that questions from ""other parties"" about ""whether this was a project to look at the referendum"", should be given the answer, ""that there is a lot going on in Europe in the next couple of months - pointing to some of the specific European economic issues (eg: Greece) that would be of concern to the Bank"".A statement from the bank said: ""Today, information related to planned confidential Bank work on the potential implications of a renegotiation and national referendum on the UK's membership of the European Union made its way into the public domain, due to an internal email sent inadvertently to an external party.""There are a range of economic and financial issues that arise in the context of the renegotiation and national referendum.  It is one of the Bank's responsibilities to assess those that relate to its objectives.""It is not sensible to talk about this work publicly, in advance. But as with work done prior to the Scottish referendum, we will disclose the details of such work at the appropriate time.""While it is unfortunate that this information has entered the public domain in this way, the Bank will maintain this approach.""David Cameron is ready to start renegotiating the terms of Britain's EU membership ahead of a referendum. Here is some further reading on what it all means: The UK and the EU: Better off in or out?What Britain wants from EuropeQ&A: The UK's planned EU referendumTimeline: EU referendum debateWhy Germany is David Cameron's new best friendMr Leslie, who was appointed shadow chancellor after Ed Balls' election defeat, told the BBC the email raised questions about whether the report would be published, if so when, and whether businesses, the Treasury or the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) would be consulted and whether the chancellor knew about the assessment.Mark Taylor, a former IMF economist and researcher at the Bank of England, said the bank would have kept the project secret to avoid being pulled into the referendum debate politically and bias David Cameron's discussions as he renegotiates the terms of EU membership.Furthermore, if the UK does leave the union, a set of bilateral agreements would have to be negotiated so the bank would want to ""keep its cards close to its chest"", he added.He said the accidental email was ""a bit Dad's Army"", quite endearing but hadn't done any ""real damage"". Conservative former Cabinet minister Owen Paterson, a prominent eurosceptic, said the Bank's project should include the option of remaining in the European Economic Area without being a member of the EU.""If the Bank does look at those very optimistic options, that is thoroughly worthwhile and I hope they will make those investigations public,"" he told the Today programme.""It isn't either 'remain in the European Union or leap into the darkness'; there are other options,"" he added.BBC business correspondent Joe Lynam said the Bank of England would have kept the project secret to avoid becoming a political ""actor"" in the referendum.The bank had appeared to be ""slightly dragged into"" the debate ahead of the referendum on Scottish independence, he said.He added that there was no evidence that talk on Twitter of it being a deliberate leak was accurate.On Friday Mr Cameron met European counterparts for the first time since his general election victory, and admitted he was ""not met with a wall of love"" as he began diplomatic negotiations aimed at securing changes to the UK's relationship with Brussels.At a summit in Riga he conceded that securing a deal would take ""patience and tenacity"" and refused to ruled out campaigning for Britain to leave the EU if his renegotiation efforts failed."

Ms Cooper is one of four candidates who have put their names forward so far. The others are Andy Burnham, Liz Kendall and Mary Creagh - candidates need the signatures of 35 MPs to make it onto the ballot paper.The BBC is to host a debate between candidates on 17 June ahead of a new leader being announced on 12 September.Ms Cooper wrote: ""The mountain we now have to climb is high. But there are some who mutter that we should give up.""That there needs to be blood on the floor for the Labour Party to rise again. That we should swing our party far to the right or far to the left, then fight it out from first principles all over again.""They believe we simply can't return to office in under a decade. They advocate, not a 2020 strategy, but a vague plan to win in 2025.""But that's no good for Labour, for Britain or for those who depend on progressive change. We can't fight and win by remaining a narrow party, we have to reach out.""Ed Miliband resigned as Labour leader after the Conservatives were elected as a majority government with 331 seats in the general election. Harriet Harman has been leading Labour temporarily until a new leader is appointed but has ruled herself out of the contest.  In the same article, Ms Cooper wrote that the party had to ""face some hard truths"" and acknowledge that it could not repeat mistakes made under Ed Miliband.She also said ""there is no comfort blanket for us either in Labour victories or Labour defeats of the past"" because ""the world has changed"".Ms Cooper added: ""Acerbic critiques and the rapid washing of hands won't make Labour win again. Nor will doing what we've done before but shouting that little bit louder.""We can't repeat the narrow approach of the last five years. But nor should we think the answer is to swallow the Tory manifesto instead.""Shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt said he would not stand for the party leadership because he had struggled to find the necessary backers and instead is backing Liz Kendall's campaign.Ms Cooper has said she wants the leader election to include ""as many people as possible"" and not be a ""closed-down or polarised contest""."

The Lib Dems said no more action would be taken after the incorrect suggestion that Nicola Sturgeon wanted David Cameron to remain as prime minister.Orkney and Shetland MP Mr Carmichael said it was an error of judgement.SNP deputy leader Stewart Hosie has said the party must be held to account.He also told the BBC he understood a complaint had already been made to the parliamentary standards commissioner.SNP leader Ms Sturgeon has called for Mr Carmichael to consider his position as an MP and described the leak of the confidential memo as a ""blatant election dirty trick"".He has since accepted ""the details of the account are not correct"" and accepted ""full responsibility for the publication"".A spokesman for the Liberal Democrats said: ""Alistair has taken responsibility and has given up £17,000. The party fully supports him as MP for Orkney and Shetland.""Mr Carmichael had been entitled to receive £17,000 severance pay after losing his Cabinet position. Speaking on BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme, Mr Hosie said: ""This is really quite outrageous, and a glib apology and an error of judgement simply aren't good enough.""How can the people of Orkney and Shetland trust him? I think they have the right to go to the polls again on what we now know.""Mr Hosie added: ""We understand there has already been a complaint raised with the parliamentary standards commissioner. I would hope that would be investigated fully.""He later said: ""Mr Carmichael has no credibility in continuing as an MP and in my opinion he should stand down. It is appropriate for the Standards Commissioner to get involved and arrive at her own conclusions, having investigated the full facts.""Protests have been held in Kirkwall, Orkney, and Lerwick, Shetland, calling for Mr Carmichael to resign.The confidential memo was published by the Daily Telegraph on 3 April as the general election campaign got under way.It was written by a civil servant in the Scotland Office and claimed Ms Sturgeon told the French Ambassador to the UK, Sylvie Bermann, that she would prefer Mr Cameron, the leader of the Conservatives, to remain as prime minister.The memo also claimed Ms Sturgeon said that Ed Miliband, who was then Labour's leader, was not prime minister material.The official cabinet office inquiry into the leaking of the memo said Mr Carmichael's former special adviser Euan Roddin gave the details to the Daily Telegraph - but he had Mr Carmichael's permission to do so.Mr Carmichael said, while he had not seen the document before it was published by the newspaper, he was ""aware of its content and agreed that my special adviser should make it public""."

Mr Macintosh and party deputy leader Kezia Dugdale have confirmed that they are standing for leadership of the party when Jim Murphy quits next month.The Eastwood MSP said his supporters were being ""bullied and intimidated"" into withdrawing their backing.Scottish Labour said the leadership contest would be conducted ""fairly"".A spokesman said Mr Macintosh had since withdrawn his allegations about the party. However, Mr Macintosh insisted his comments still stood but had not been aimed at party staff.He has not named those he thinks are responsible.Scottish Labour general secretary Brian Roy said: ""I have spoken to Ken Macintosh and he has withdrawn his allegations about the party. The leadership contest in Scotland will be conducted fairly and openly.""In response, Mr Macintosh said: ""I am not withdrawing anything. I clarified with Brian [Roy] that the allegations are not against party staff, but against the machine politics which have too much influence in the Labour Party.""Mr Macintosh, the party's social justice spokesman, ran for party leadership against Johann Lamont almost four years ago and is likely to need nominations from six or seven MSPs to be a candidate in this leadership contest. Ms Dugdale, who is widely regarded as the ""obvious person"" to take on the job, confirmed her leadership bid on Friday.But he claims his backers are coming under ""incredible pressure to withdraw their support"".""I want to have a contest but I've found the whole weight of the party machine yet again turning against me trying to close down a contest,"" he told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme. ""All the people that have been trying to support me, the party machine has turned on them, and they are being put under incredible pressure to withdraw their support. They are being bullied and being intimidated and pressurised not to support me so we don't have a contest.""I wouldn't even have put my head above the parapet if I didn't know I had that support.""Mr Macintosh, who won a majority of member votes in the last leadership contest, said the three-college system used by the Labour Party to elect leaders was ""ridiculous"". ""I want the members to take control of the party,"" he said. ""We need to move to one member, one vote.""He called for a quick contest, before the summer if possible, that is ""fair and democratic"".By BBC Scotland political correspondent Glenn CampbellKezia Dugdale already has the backing of twenty Labour MSPs for her bid to become Scottish party leader. That's more than half the Labour team at Holyrood. Many of them would like her elected unopposed. Yet when she announced her intention to stand, Ms Dugdale said she would ""absolutely"" welcome a contest. Ken MacIntosh is offering that challenge. He is likely to require the support of six or seven MSPs to become a candidate. But he claims his supporters are being ""bullied and intimidated"" by what he calls the ""party machine"" in an attempt to avoid a contest. He has not been more specific. There are certainly those who think a coronation would save time and political energy and allow Labour to concentrate on the 2016 Holyrood election campaign. Others argue that a contest would allow a fuller debate about Labour's problems and possible solutions and give the new leader more authority to pursue reform. Mr Macintosh said he would campaign on fairness and social justice across the whole of Scotland with an emphasis on lifelong learning, housing and renewable energy.""The reason I think it is important that I put my views forward is I think that is all about restoring trust in the Labour Party,"" he said. ""At the last election people could not bring themselves to put their trust in Labour. I can't believe that after all these years and what we stand for.""Mr Macintosh said restoring the Scottish Labour Party required integrity, principles and honesty and ""moving away from machine politics and guile and the idea it's about power and position"".""I'm in politics to make other people's lives better, whether I'm leader or not leader, whether I'm MSP or not MSP. I am a conviction politician,"" he said.He said problems with the ""party machine"" were about ""people who want power and position and influence"", which was an ""issue for all politicians"". ""We have to remember our principles and if we can't do that we can't restore confidence in the Labour Party,"" Mr Macintosh added.Former East Renfrewshire MP Mr Murphy announced that he would resign next month after Labour's crushing general election defeat at the hands of the SNP. Ms Dugdale, the Lothian region MSP, said she welcomed a leadership contest. She has won the backing of more than half of Scottish Labour's MSPs and MP Ian Murray since announcing her intention to stand on Friday. ""I am proud to have already won the support of so many Labour colleagues in the Scottish Parliament,"" Ms Dugdale said.""The geographical spread of support I have - with MSPs from north and south, east and west - as well as the backing of MSPs from different parts of our movement shows I can bring our party together."""

He added: ""Politics is a brutal business,"" because ""it was a real possibility"" his party might win, and he might become chancellor.Commenting on the campaign, he said: 'I think I wanted to be more pro-business but I also backed Ed Miliband 100%. ""He was the leader I was the shadow chancellor we both worked very hard and in the end neither he or I persuaded people and we need to take our responsibility for that. It's not all on him it's on all of us.""Were you up for that Ed Balls moment - the symbol of Labour's crushing electoral defeat, the trigger for wild Tory celebrations and Labour despair?Ed Balls was in reflective mood when we spoke - looking back at what he'd achieved as much as forward to what might be next.For the rest of Nick's article and a full transcript of the interview, click here.In one of the shock results of election night, the former shadow chancellor lost his Morley and Outwood seat in West Yorkshire by 422 votes to Conservative Andrea Jenkyns.He had previously had a majority of 1,101 in the constituency on the outskirts of Leeds.Asked by Nick Robinson if he was one of the reasons Labour was unelectable, Mr Balls replied: ""Of course. ""I mean Ed Miliband said straight after the election he took responsibility but all of us have to bear our share of responsibility. ""Ed was the leader I backed him as shadow chancellor 100%. In the end he didn't persuade people he could  be the prime minister but I didn't persuade people I could be the chancellor either. I have to take that on the chin. ""People will analyse for weeks and months what happened and that's something that still feels too early for me."" Speaking about his own future, Mr Balls said: ""I'm not going to be dashing back"" to frontline politics but ""never say never"". He was, he said, embarking on ""a new chapter, outside of politics. No by-elections, not back in parliament, that is how it feels at the moment. Outside of politics is where I am going next."" He says his wife Yvette Cooper, who is running to be Labour leader, is ""brilliant and people will get a chance to see what she stands for"" but he insisted that ""I am not playing a role in her campaign"" except ""whilst she is busy I can do more to help family"".  Asked whether whether he worries that she is applying for the toughest job in British politics he said: ""You have to take your calling when it comes."" Mr Balls did not rule out appearing on Strictly Come Dancing - a prospect his wife has described as ""truly terrifying"" - but he told Nick Robinson that despite running three marathons ""I'm not sure if I'm equipped for Strictly."" He said he'd be spending his time ""cooking, running, playing the piano"" and using ""real time to stand back and think"" to write about economics.  He reflected, finally, on his image - and how he was perceived by the electorate:  ""It is very hard in politics for people to see the real you. You are seen through the prism your opponents set up.""Mr Balls' demise spelled the end of a decade in Parliament which has seen him at the heart of the Labour machine.He held the position of chief economic adviser to the Treasury in the Blair government from 1997, working on policies including Sure Start, tax credits and the national minimum wage.Ed Balls first became an MP in 2005 and a year later was made Economic Secretary to the Treasury.He was a close adviser to then-chancellor Gordon Brown and earned a reputation as a political bruiser."
2015-05-20,Cameron 'confident' of EU success,https://web.archive.org//web/20150524033726/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32840696,"David Cameron has said he is confident he can get a better deal for the UK in Europe but admitted it ""won't be easy"". Speaking at an EU summit in Latvia, he said he had not been greeted ""by a wall of love"" when he met EU leaders for the first time since his election win.But he said he had a mandate and the ""British people at his back"" for the changes he wanted to achieve.The prime minister will hold talks with Angela Merkel and EU Commission boss Jean-Claude Juncker next week.Mr Cameron will also meet French President Francois Hollande as he tries to win support for his position.Other EU countries have said they will listen to what the UK has to say, the Finnish prime minister Alexander Stubb saying he backed the UK's proposals to cut red tape and was sure ""some kind of compromise"" could be reached. But some member states have questioned the need for any change to EU treaties, something Mr Cameron has said he wants to see, and ruled out any watering down of the key principle of freedom of movement. Speaking at a meeting of EU leaders, Mr Cameron said he believed it was in the interests of both the UK and its European partners for the UK to remain part of the European Union but under different terms.The British people, he said, were not happy with the status quo and wanted change on issues such as welfare, immigration and an opt-out from further integration.Mr Cameron said he had only begun to ""scratch the surface"" of the discussions but would travel to Berlin and Paris next week as well as hosting European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker at his country residence, Chequers, on Monday.He said the British people needed ""the best possible choice"" about the UK's future in Europe and did not rule out bringing forward his promised referendum, currently scheduled to take place by the end of 2017. Mr Cameron said he expected ""lots of ups and downs"" in the process and reminding journalists that many of their pre-election forecasts were wrong, he urged them to ""wait for the result"".""I do not expect to find agreed solutions straight away,"" he told them.""These talks will require patience and tenacity. But by working together in the right spirit and sticking at it, I believe we can reform the EU and our relationship with it. And then the British people will have the final say. They will decide.""The changes he was seeking were ""deliverable and doable"", he insisted.""I've set out a series of changes which I think address the main concerns that British people have, that I have, about Europe and the way it works. And I'm confident of getting those changes.""British officials said the process was at a very early stage, but the meetings with Mrs Merkel, regarded as Germany's most powerful leader and Mr Juncker, the most senior official in Brussels, will be seen as key to setting the tone for future discussions. Mr Cameron is committed to holding an in/out referendum on Britain's membership of the EU by the end of 2017, but there is speculation it could be held next year to avoid a clash with elections in France and Germany.Legislation paving the way for the UK referendum is expected to be published next Thursday, the day after the Queen opens Parliament.Asked whether he would be prepared to recommend a UK exit if he did not get the outcome he wanted, Mr Cameron said he would ""not rule anything out"". David Cameron is ready to start renegotiating the terms of Britain's EU membership ahead of a referendum. Here is some further reading on what it all means: The UK and the EU: Better off in or out?What Britain wants from EuropeQ&A: The UK's planned EU referendumTimeline: EU referendum debateWhy Germany is David Cameron's new best friendBBC deputy political editor James Landale said Mr Cameron had used the summit, arranged to discuss the EU's relationship with Russia and its neighbours, to sound out other European leaders about what they might be willing to accept before the start of ""intricate"" negotiations in the coming months.Other EU leaders, he added, were ""scared witless"" by the possibility of the UK leaving the EU and were willing to listen and consider a deal, but there were some things - such as changes to freedom of movement rules - which were ""sacrosanct"".Mr Cameron has not revealed the full details of what he is seeking from any changes, but he is expected to demand an opt-out from one its core principles of forging an ""ever-closer union"" between member states. He will also try to get more powers to block or opt out of new EU laws, and for restrictions on welfare benefits for migrants until they have lived in the UK for four years.This week, a number of UK business leaders started to highlight the potential implications of the referendum, with the president of the CBI saying businesses should ""speak out early"" in favour of remaining in a reformed EU,The Labour Party, SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems are in favour of staying in the EU. UKIP, which got almost four million votes but only one MP in the election, want to leave."

Mr Pickles was the major casualty of David Cameron's post-election reshuffle, leaving his post as Communities Secretary - a job he held throughout the coalition government.The former leader of Bradford Council has taken on a new role as anti-corruption tsar. Mr Pickles, a former chairman of the Conservative Party, has been MP for Brentwood and Ongar since 1992. He was returned with an increased majority at the recent general election.Mr Pickles said his family were ""absolutely delighted"" and he was looking forward to his investiture.""I'm obviously very pleased with the honour and am looking forward to my day at the Palace,"" he said.""When I left the Cabinet the prime minister asked if I would accept a knighthood and I indicated that I would but it then has to go through a committee. I'm very pleased."""

2015-05-20,Labour contenders,https://web.archive.org//web/20150524033726/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32654262,"The race to succeed Ed Miliband as Labour leader is well under way following the party's general election defeat.Candidates are attempting to gather the 35 MPs' signatures they require to make it onto the ballot paper.Deputy leader Harriet Harman, who has taken temporary charge, says she will stand down once a new leader and deputy are elected.So who are the current and potential candidates to succeed Mr Miliband? And who is vying for the deputy leader job?Shadow health minister Liz Kendall was the first Labour MP to say they wanted a crack at the party's top job, saying a ""fundamentally new approach"" was needed.First elected to Parliament in 2010 as MP for Leicester West and appointed to the shadow front bench the same year, Ms Kendall is seen as a Blairite contender.She is a former special adviser to Harriet Harman and then Health Secretary Patricia Hewitt who has argued for reform of public services.In an interview for The House magazine in January, she said there ""will remain a role"" for private and voluntary firms in the health service, ""where they can add extra capacity to the NHS or challenge to the system"".Could she be a fresh face to lead a change of direction for Labour, or seen as too inside the Westminster bubble?The Labour MP for Leigh since 2001, Andy Burnham has plenty of government experience and is the current bookies' favourite.Mr Burnham served as health secretary under Gordon Brown and previously as culture secretary and chief secretary to the Treasury.He stood for the leadership in 2010 but lost out to Ed Miliband, going on to hold the shadow health brief under Mr Miliband's leadership. He is said to have strong trade union support.Declaring his intention to stand, he said Labour must support the ""aspirations of everyone"".Another former chief secretary to the Treasury - as well as a work and pensions minister under Gordon Brown - Yvette Cooper has been shadow home secretary for the past four years.A strong Commons performer, she has given Home Secretary Theresa May a hard time over matters including passport delays, border controls and extremism.She did not stand to succeed Mr Brown in 2010, in favour of her husband, Ed Balls.Announcing her bid this time around, she said: ""Our promise of hope wasn't strong enough to drown out the Tory and UKIP voices of fear. That's what we need to change.""The shadow international development secretary has announced her intention to join the race for the Labour leadership, via an article in the Daily MailMs Creagh joined parliament in 2005 as the MP for Wakefield, gaining experience in government as an assistant whip in 2009-10.She's also held various shadow cabinet positions in opposition, most notably as shadow secretary of state for environment, food and rural affairs - and transport.Ms Creagh held onto her brief as international development secretary in acting Labour leader Harriet Harman's recent reshuffle of the shadow cabinet.The MP for Don Valley has been Labour's shadow energy and climate change secretary since 2011, after a stint heading up the Department for Communities and Local Government.Ms Flint held on to her current position in the latest shadow cabinet reshuffle.She also held various ministerial positions during Gordon Brown's premiership, but famously resigned from as Europe minister after accusing him of treating her and her female colleagues as ""window dressing"".A former GMTV presenter, Gloria de Piero joined Parliament as the MP for Ashfield in 2010.She immediately rose to shadow ministerial ranks, taking on a culture, media and sport brief and then home affairs.Since 2013 she's been a shadow minister for women and equalities, being one of Harriet Harman's team on Labour's woman-to-woman ""pink bus"" campaign.The MP for West Bromwich since 2001.

Another from the 2010 intake, she was praised for campaign against payday loans companies, and has a strong following on social media.She told the Sunday Mirror: ""Too many voters think Labour is no longer a movement for social justice but a machine that only kicks in to gear at election time.""Shadow environment secretary Angela Eagle plans to travel the country to speak to people who did the ""hard graft"" in the election campaign.The MP for Wallasey said Labour could not be ""complacent"" if it was to reverse its general election defeat.Ms Eagle, an MP since 1992, held a number of ministerial jobs during the last Labour government and in 2013 became chair of the Labour Party.She is arguably best-known for having a twin sister, Maria, who is also a Labour MP.A former journalist and Labour cabinet minister, Ben Bradshaw has been the MP for Exeter since 1997.He plans a ""big tent"" approach to ensure Labour does not miss out on votes in the south of England, saying the party has to ""broaden its appeal"".Reflecting on who should replace Ed Miliband, he said: ""I would prefer to see one of the new generation come forward rather than someone associated with the Blair and Brown era.""If we really want to win in 2020 - and I think we need to for the country's sake -  I would like to see someone from the new generation without that baggage from the past.""The MP for Tottenham was the first person to publicly weigh up a leadership bid, telling the BBC that he would consider standing if colleagues wanted him to.But he's ruled himself out of the top job, saying his principal aim is to become Labour's candidate for Mayor of London in 2016.""I think we need a leader that can win back the Midlands understand Scotland as well as the south.""Actually we need to do better in London, my strengths are in London and the south therefore I want to be the Labour candidate for Mayor,"" he told the BBC's Daily Politics programme.One of the most prominent black MPs in the party, the former former barrister is regarded as being on the right of the party, having served as a minister under both Tony Blair and Gordon Brown.His national profile rose during the 2011 riots in London, when he appealed for calm and reconciliation in the wake of the fatal shooting of Mark Duggan in his north London constituency. Dame Tessa Jowell was a key figure at the heart of New Labour - she once said she would ""jump under a bus"" for Tony Blair.The former Dulwich and West Norwood MP, who stood down at the general election after 20 years in Parliament, earned widespread plaudits for the role she played in London's bid for the 2012 Olympics and her subsequent performance as Olympics minister.She has vowed to bring ""Olympic-like discipline"" to changing London, promising to build more affordable homes.The former culture secretary, who was a psychiatric social worker before entering politics, is seen as one of the frontrunners in the race to be Labour's mayoral candidate, with one poll suggesting she is backed by 40% of Labour supporters.Sadiq Khan launched his bid to be London mayor with an attack on incumbent Boris Johnson, describing him as a ""red carpet mayor, somebody who is fantastic going to openings, great with a flute of champagne in his hands"".""I'd rather roll up my sleeves and fight for all Londoners,"" he added.The son of a bus driver, Mr Khan worked as a human rights solicitor before becoming an MP in 2005. He is shadow London minister.A close ally of former Labour leader Ed Miliband, Mr Khan served in junior ministerial roles in Gordon Brown's government.A familiar face to viewers of BBC One's This Week, Diane Abbott is a veteran left winger who first entered the Commons in 1987, as one of Britain's first black MPs.The Hackney North and Stoke Newington MP was shadow public health spokesman under Ed Miliband, after losing out to him in the 2010 Labour leadership contest.Launching her mayoral bid, she said she would bring London's communities together and be the ""genuinely independently minded Mayor that London needs"".""Hard times call for a campaigning Mayor. Now more than ever our city needs a Mayor who will stand up for the interests of those increasingly left behind,"" she added.A journalist and railway historian, Christian Wolmar is one of Britain's most in-demand transport pundits.The only non-politician in the race, he campaigns against the construction of HS2 and has vowed to tackle London's ""housing crisis"", improve the transport network and revitalise public spaces.""Instead of partisan and personality politics London needs a dedicated, ideas driven mayor who works for Londoners and their needs,"" he said.The 65-year-old cycles to campaign meeting and claims to have clocked up more than 2,000 miles already.Chuka Umunna was the second candidate to declare he would stand for election as leader of the Labour Party.A rising star of the party, Mr Umunna was first elected to Parliament in 2010 and appointed shadow business secretary the following year.He has retained the seat of Streatham with a majority of nearly 14,000 and a vastly increased vote share this time round.He announced his intention to stand via a post on his Facebook page. He said he had spoken to half the Labour 80 candidates standing in Tory seats targeted by the party and other MPs before making his announcement. However, three days later Mr Umunna withdrew from the leadership contest. He said in a statement posted on his Twitter feed that had been uncomfortable with the level of ""sheer pressure"" and scrutiny that came with being a candidate.The 36-year-old added that it had perhaps been ""too soon"" for him to launch a leadership bid.Another rising star of the 2010 intake, the MP for Leeds West was appointed shadow chief secretary to the Treasury in 2011 and shadow work and pensions secretary in 2013.During the election campaign, she attacked the so-called bedroom tax, whereby housing benefit payments are reduced for tenants in council and social housing deemed to have spare rooms.However, she also suggested Labour would consider reducing the overall welfare cap in some areas.She told BBC News Labour needs ""to be in the centre ground to win a general election"" but ruled herself out of a leadership bid.A former home secretary and shadow chancellor, Alan Johnson is the Labour leadership candidate who never quite was.The popular MP declined to stand in 2010 and stepped down from his shadow cabinet role in 2011 for personal reasons.Earlier this year it was reported that senior New Labour figures Lord Mandelson and Alistair Campbell approached Mr Johnson over a leadership bid, although all three later distanced themselves from the story.But the former postman, who has been MP for Hull West and Hessle since 1997, had seemingly ruled himself out again, saying it is a ""10-year job"" and he does not have the ""right qualities"". Former army officer Dan Jarvis was elected MP for Barnsley Central in a by-election in 2011, having resigned his commission as a major in the Parachute Regiment to contest the seat.He held onto his seat at the general election, taking time out from campaigning to run the London Marathon last month.After entering Parliament in 2010, he quickly became a shadow culture, media and sport minister and later a shadow justice minister.In 2011, Mr Jarvis became the first serving politician in more than 60 years to be awarded a military honour, when he was made an MBE for his services to the armed forces.He has been touted by some colleagues as a future Labour leader but Mr Jarvis, who was widowed in 2010 and has a young family, ruled himself out, saying it is not the ""right time"" for him and his family. Historian and journalist Tristram Hunt entered Parliament in 2010 as Labour MP for Stoke-on-Trent Central.Ed Miliband made him shadow education secretary in 2013 and he has been a fierce critic of the coalition's education policies in England.Speaking in the aftermath of the election results, he called on Labour's ruling National Executive Committee ""not to rush our election"", saying there was time for a ""brutal post-mortem"" about Labour's ""underlying philosophy and thinking"".As for his own ambitions, he said ""it's about the lyrics as much as the lead singer I think"".He later said he was not confident of getting enough nominations to stand, and would support Liz Kendall.The MP for Rochdale says the deputy leader vacancy has ""come a bit too soon"" for him.He previously said a number of colleagues had asked him to put his name forward for the role.Mr Danczuk is well known for his prominent campaigning against child sex abuse and leading calls for an inquiry into allegations of historical child sex abuse by senior figures at Westminster.He was a vocal critic of Ed Miliband and in an article for the Daily Telegraph on Thursday he said Labour needed to ""step out if its Metropolitan comfort zone"" and ""reach out to the country once more.""The former director of public prosecutions has only just become an MP after being elected in Frank Dobson's old seat of Holborn and St Pancras, in North London at the general election.He was forced to rule himself out of the race to be Labour leader following a social media campaign urging him to stand.He said he was ""flattered"" by the campaign but the party needed someone with ""more political experience"".The older brother of ex-leader Ed, David Miliband was frontrunner to replace Gordon Brown in 2010, until his sibling beat him by a whisker.A former foreign secretary and MP for South Shields, he was the Blairite choice for leader but eventually quit Parliament to become head of the International Rescue Committee charity in New York in 2013.Speaking to the BBC from the US on the Monday after the general election, Mr Miliband criticised his brother's campaign in the 2015 general election, saying he and Mr Brown had ""allowed themselves to be portrayed as moving backwards from the principles of aspiration and inclusion that are the absolute heart of any successful progressive political project"".While he acknowledged the two men were ""brothers for life"", he also confirmed he was not eligible to stand for the party leadership as he is not an MP.Labour's election rulesMPs wishing to stand as leader and deputy leader have to be nominated by 15% of their colleagues in the Parliamentary Labour Party to be eligible to stand.As Labour now has 232 MPs, this means prospective candidates must get at least 34 signatures. That means the maximum size of any field is six contenders.Under rules agreed last year, all Labour Party members, registered supporters and affiliated supporters - including union members - will be allowed a maximum of one vote each on a one member, one vote system. When the election is held, they will be asked to rank candidates in order of preference.If no candidate gets 50% of all votes cast, the votes will be added up and the candidate with the fewest votes eliminated. Their 2nd preference votes will then be redistributed until one candidate has 50% of all votes cast."
2015-05-20,What Britain wants from Europe,https://web.archive.org//web/20150524033726/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32695399,"David Cameron says he has a mandate to pursue EU reform following the Conservatives' general election victory. The PM, who will be hoping his majority government will give him extra leverage in Brussels, wants to renegotiate the terms of the UK's membership ahead of a referendum by the end of 2017. He has said he will campaign for Britain to remain in the EU if he gets the reforms he wants.Mr Cameron has said he does not want to reveal full details of his negotiating hand but he has given a broad indication, in a series of speeches and newspaper articles, of his priorities when he goes into talks with other EU leaders.These are: The prime minister has said Britain would resist any move towards a European Army and that he wants to free British police forces from EU interference. He has also ruled out Britain joining the euro.But he has placed less emphasis in recent years on demanding changes to EU social policy, such as the maximum 48-hour working week, agency workers, maternity leave and non-discrimination rules.The official UK government position is that a referendum will be held by the end of 2017 but Downing Street sources have said: ""If we can do it earlier we will.""There is speculation David Cameron is planning to hold the vote in 2016 to avoid a clash with French and German elections in 2017.The prime minister wants treaty change but even if the referendum was held in 2017 there may not be enough time to legally incorporate any reforms into a treaty and it would have to be done at a later stage.An early referendum would anger Eurosceptics who believe it would not allow enough time to make the case for exit or negotiate any meaningful concessions.""A rushed process would severely undermine the chances to secure a significant deal that both British business and voters could support and would waste the opportunity of a lifetime,"" Matthew Elliott, chief executive of Business for Britain told Breitbart London.The question is always crucial in any referendum and there is already a debate about what it should be. The Draft European Union (Referendum) Bill, published by the Conservatives in 2013, proposed this form of words: ""Do you think that the United Kingdom should remain a member of the European Union?""Some thought that leaned too far towards the status quo, encouraging a yes vote, and the Electoral Commission said it was not clear and direct enough. The watchdog proposed this form of words instead: ""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union?""The new Conservative government will attempt to repeal the Human Rights Act, which requires UK courts to treat the European Court of Human Rights as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. The European Court of Human Rights is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe (CoE), which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine.The freedom for people to move around Europe, enshrined in the EU treaties, works in parallel with the other three basic freedoms in the single market: freedom of goods, capital and services.It is likely to be a ""red line"" for other EU leaders, who do not want to see it eroded.Mr Cameron has steered clear of tackling it directly - for example by asking for an emergency ""brake"" on free movement, or a cap on numbers - focusing instead on reducing the incentive provided by welfare payments. In a speech last November, David Cameron set out measures to reduce the number of EU nationals moving to the UK.His main proposals were:Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission, has said he is ready to work with Mr Cameron to ""strike a fair deal for the United Kingdom in the EU"". The leaders of other EU nations have previously warned they are unlikely to support major changes to EU treaties to accommodate British demands. But Mr Cameron's general election victory may have given him extra leverage. ""The ball is very much in the court of the UK now,"" a senior EU official told The Guardian. ""It's up to the British to define what they want."" The key figure will be German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is very keen to keep Britain in the EU but has so far been unwilling to make major concessions to enable that to happen. There are fears that a ""pick and mix"" approach to EU treaties would undermine EU cohesion.Mr Cameron has said there is ""no doubt"" his planned reforms will require changes to the treaties governing the European Union. But this would require the unanimous support of all EU members, and may not be possible within the deadline he has set of a referendum before the end of 2017. Any attempt to change EU laws on free movement would meet fierce resistance from some EU nations, particularly Eastern European states. Mr Juncker has said free movement is non-negotiable.Mr Cameron may find it difficult to get unanimous support for his proposals for a four-year waiting period for migrant workers claiming UK benefits. East European EU members would be likely to oppose this, on the grounds that it would discriminate against their citizens.  Attempts to secure opt-outs for the City are unlikely to go down well with other European leaders.However, there are precedents for EU treaty changes to accommodate some countries' specific concerns - for example, the protocol attached to the Lisbon Treaty for Ireland.Mr Cameron has faced repeated calls to say whether he would campaign for Britain's exit from the EU in the referendum if he fails to get what he wants from the renegotiation process. All he has said is that he will ""rule nothing out"". Some Conservative MPs want Britain to leave the EU no matter what David Cameron manages to renegotiate. A larger group are likely to want more concessions than Mr Cameron has so far indicated he is prepared to demand.Senior backbencher David Davis, who was defeated by Mr Cameron for the Tory leadership in 2005, told the Daily Telegraph the majority of the 332 Conservative MPs want Mr Cameron to negotiate an ""opt-out"" power to stop individual EU laws from applying to Britain. The prime minister has said this would be ""impossible"" without Britain leaving the EU.Mr Davis claims as many as 60 Tory MPs would be prepared to rebel and vote for Britain's exit from the EU if the prime minister fails to deliver.Graham Brady, chairman of the Tory backbench 1922 committee, which represents backbenchers, has urged David Cameron to give all Conservative MPs, including ministers, a free vote in the EU referendum.In January, Mr Cameron warned that serving cabinet ministers would have to quit the government if they wanted to campaign to leave the EU if he had secured the reforms to it he wants.In the 1975 referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Economic Community, as the EU was then called, Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson decided to suspend collective responsibility because his cabinet was split on the issue. Ministers were allowed to vote with their consciences and campaign against each other. The majority of them, including Mr Wilson, joined the Yes camp, but left-wingers, such as Tony Benn, played a leading role in the No campaign. The Yes campaign won easily with 67% of the vote."

2015-05-20,Man overboard,https://web.archive.org//web/20150524033726/http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-32830379,"Harold Wilson died 20 years ago, on 24 May 1995. He would have died many years before that, writes novelist Isabel Wolff, had her family not saved him from drowning. As a child I spent many family holidays on the Isles of Scilly, 28 miles off the Cornish coast. We'd spend our time walking, cycling and, best of all, rock-pooling.  But where we would normally expect to catch a few shrimps and the odd crab, there was one memorable year when we pulled the Leader of Her Majesty's Opposition out of the water.  It was 10 August 1973 and we were enjoying a bike ride around the largest island, St Mary's. I was with my parents, my elder brother Simon, 16, then a pupil at Rugby School, his best friend Robert, and my younger brother, Matthew, who was 10.  As we cycled along a path above an isolated bay, Matthew spotted an empty rubber dinghy racing out to the open sea. As we watched it speed towards the horizon we wondered whose it was and why it was loose.  Suddenly my father said that he thought he'd heard a cry. Sure enough, above the buffeting of the wind we could just make out a distressed male voice. My father cupped his hands and shouted: ""What is your trouble?""  ""I can't get into my boat,"" the voice answered. ""Fetch a dinghy!""  We pedalled down to the bay as fast as we could.  My father yelled: ""We'll get to you in a few minutes. Can you hold on?""  ""Yes - for a bit,"" came the faint reply. While Robert sped off to alert the Coastguard, Simon found a dinghy - but it had no oars. My father hurriedly looked around for a pair but then, further off, saw a wooden ""pram"" dinghy, its oars still in its rowlocks.  He and Simon carried this to the water's edge and, with Simon guiding him, my father rowed out towards a group of motor launches moored about 300 yards from the shore. While they did this my mother, Matthew and I waited on the beach, which was deserted except for a benign looking Labrador chained up by a fisherman's hut.  The dog's name tag said ""Paddy"" and Matthew and I stroked his ears while we anxiously waited for events to unfold.   Twenty minutes later we saw my father and Simon coming back. Hunched between them in the boat was a bedraggled looking, but familiar figure.  ""It's Harold Wilson,"" I said.  As my father rowed towards the quay, the Labour leader suddenly stood up, nearly swamping the boat. He then sat down again until it had docked, and Simon helped him onto dry land.  I vividly recall how shocked he looked. His shorts and shirt were drenched, his hair was plastered to his scalp, his teeth were chattering and his face was white.  He declined my father's offer of further help, including the loan of a bike to get back to his bungalow, but said that he was glad that we'd come along when we did.  My father jovially responded that it wasn't every day one pulled a former prime minister out of the water and that we were happy to have been able to help.  Satisfied that Wilson was all right, we left him with Paddy and cycled away.  As we ate our picnic lunch my father and Simon explained that Wilson had slipped into the sea while attempting to step from his rubber dinghy onto his motor launch.  The dinghy had shot away from him - the dinghy that we'd seen.  Unable to pull himself into the boat, Wilson had been left hanging on to the fender ropes for dear life. He'd told them that he'd been feeling sea-sick and that his arms felt ""numb"" and were ""giving out"".  Simon had stepped on to Wilson's boat and had then hauled the man on to the deck ""like a sack of potatoes"".  Dad then swore us all to secrecy - if the story got out it could ruin the opposition leader's holiday, and our own.  The next morning we went down to Porthcressa and by chance we saw Wilson coming off the beach.   I remember thinking that he'd be happy to see us again - perhaps he'd even ask us to tea? To my surprise I saw a flash of irritation cross his face.   My father greeted him and asked how he was.  He replied that he felt all right, if rather stiff, and that he had spent the rest of the day in bed.  ""I've had my swim for the holiday though,"" he added pleasantly, then he went on his way and we didn't see him again.  Returning home after the holiday we told no-one what had happened but somehow, a month later, the story got out.  First my father was approached by our local paper which made the story a splash: ""Rugby Family Rescues Mr. Wilson From Sea."" This got picked up by the Birmingham Post and within 48 hours my father's face was on the front of every national newspaper.  Headlines such as ""Wilson Snatched From Drowning"" and ""Wilson Rescued in Sea Drama"" amused us, but we were outraged by the Daily Mirror's ""My Dog Tipped me In!""  In a piece of Labour spin, Wilson's press secretary, Joe Haines, had apparently blamed the labrador.  There was even a photo of ""the culprit"", Paddy, who was ""in the doghouse"".  One could see the need for damage limitation - the incident was extremely embarrassing for Wilson, not least because the Prime Minister Ted Heath was a world-class yachtsman. There were cartoons of Heath grinning at the news on board his yacht, Morning Cloud.  My father, a nuclear engineer, was besieged at work by TV film crews and quizzed about his voting habits. ""Lifelong Tory Saves Wilson from Drowning"", announced the Daily Telegraph.  The Times pointed out that the Labour Leader, whose party had pledged to end private education, had been rescued by a public schoolboy.  And so it went on. We put up with myriad jokes of the ""Why didn't you throw him back?"" variety.  In the meantime Haines continued to elaborate on the story.  Wilson, he claimed in the Mirror, was in ""no danger"".  He ""could have swum to the beach"" but was ""waiting for a friend"".  The truth is, Harold Wilson would have died.  Aged 57, he'd been in the cold water, never more than 15C on Scilly, for more than half an hour.  Knowing the strong Atlantic currents, he hadn't dared risk the long swim back to the beach.  Worst of all, in that deserted spot, there had been no-one to hear his cries.   Reflecting on the incident afterwards, my father told us that Wilson seemed not to understand that it was ""only by the slenderest margins"" that his life had been saved.  Six months later, in February 1974, Harold Wilson became prime minister again.It's now 42 years since ""The Wilson Affair"" as my family always called it.  It seems strange that despite all the publicity this very significant event in the life of Wilson is almost unknown.  Neither of his official biographers, Ben Pimlott and Philip Ziegler, mentioned it in their respective books, nor did Joe Haines revisit it in his own memoir of Wilson, Glimmers of Twilight.  I sometimes wondered how Wilson's colleagues had viewed the story at the time. Were they sympathetic? Amused?  Did they pull his leg about it?  ""Oh I remember it well,"" Denis Healey told me when I phoned him in the House of Lords a few months ago. ""Harold seemed very embarrassed by it and was clearly anxious to play the whole thing down.  We didn't feel that we could mention it to him - definitely not.""  And if my family hadn't happened to pass by when we did?  It's fair to say that the course of British politics might have been rather different.  Denis Healey or Jim Callaghan might have succeeded Wilson. Edward Heath might not have been defeated in 1974 and there might well have been no Tory leadership challenge the following year and therefore, quite possibly, no Thatcher premiership.  My late brother, Simon, used to wonder whether our father may, on that fateful August day, have inadvertently launched Margaret  Thatcher's prime ministerial career. The rest, as they say, is history.Isabel Wolff is author of GhostwrittenSubscribe to the BBC News Magazine's email newsletter to get articles sent to your inbox"
2015-05-20,Out or in?,https://web.archive.org//web/20150524033726/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32793642,"David Cameron has promised a referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Union by the end of 2017. Here is a summary of the key arguments for and against British membership.If Britain votes to leave the EU, it will have to negotiate a new trading relationship with what would now be a 27 member organisation, to allow British firms to sell goods and services to EU countries without being hit by excessive tariffs and other restrictions.Better off out: Britain could negotiate an ""amicable divorce"", but retain strong trading links with EU nations, say those campaigning for Britain's exit. There are several potential scenarios:Better off in: An ""amicable divorce"" is a pipe dream, pro-EU campaigners argue. France, Germany and other leading EU nations would never allow Britain a ""pick and mix"" approach to the bloc's rules. Norway and Switzerland have to abide by many EU rules without any influence over how they are formed. Negotiating a comprehensive free trade agreement could take years and have an uncertain outcome. And if Britain went for a completely clean break with the EU its exports would be subject to tariffs and would still have to meet EU production standards, harming the competitiveness of British business.The run-up to the EU referendum is likely to be dominated by competing claims about how many millions of jobs will be lost or gained by Britain's exit. All such claims come with a health warning. Coming up with a precise figure is difficult as there is no way of knowing if threats by foreign companies to scale back their operations in the UK would come to pass or, indeed, how many jobs would be created by the reshaped economy that might emerge in the wake of an exit.Better off out: There would be a jobs boom as firms are freed from EU regulations and red tape, say those arguing for an exit, with small- and medium-sized companies who don't trade with the EU benefiting the most. In its recent paper, the EU Jobs Myth, the free market Institute for Economic Affairs seeks to debunk the claim that 3-4 million jobs would be lost if Britain left. ""Jobs are associated with trade, not membership of a political union, and there is little evidence to suggest that trade would substantially fall between British businesses and European consumers in the event the UK was outside the EU,"" it argues. ""The UK labour market is incredibly dynamic, and would adapt quickly to changed relationships with the EU.""Better off in: Millions of jobs would be lost as global manufacturers moved to lower-cost EU countries. Britain's large, foreign-owned car industry would be particularly at risk. ""The attractiveness of the UK as a place to invest and do automotive business is clearly underpinned by the UK's influential membership of the EU,"" said a KPMG report on the car industry last year. The financial services sector, which employs about 2.1 million people in the UK, also has concerns about a British exit. ""The success of the UK financial services industry is to a large extent built on EU Internal Market legislation. To abandon this for some untried, unknown and unpredictable alternative would carry very significant risks,"" said global law firm Clifford Chance in a report by think tank TheCityUK last year.Much would depend on the trade deals Britain managed to negotiate with the EU and rest of the world after its exit. The best-case scenario, according to think tank Open Europe, is that the UK would be better off by 1.6% of GDP a year by 2030. That is assuming the UK carried out widespread deregulation after its exit and managed to strike favourable trade deals. The think tank adds: ""A far more realistic range is between a 0.8% permanent loss to GDP in 2030 and a 0.6% permanent gain in GDP in 2030, in scenarios where Britain mixes policy approaches"".The Centre for Economic Performance, at the London School of Economics, says the worst-case scenario is a 6.3% to 9.5% reduction in GDP, ""a loss of a similar size to that resulting from the global financial crisis of 2008/09"". The best case, according to their analysis, is a loss of 2.2% of GDP.Better off out: Britain would regain full control of its borders. UKIP wants to see a work permit system introduced, so that EU nationals would face the same visa restrictions as those from outside the EU, which it says would reduce population growth from current levels of 298,000 a year to about 50,000. This would create job opportunities for British workers and boost wages, as well as easing pressure on schools, hospitals and other public services. Better off in: Britain might have to agree to allow free movement of EU migrants as the price of being allowed access to the free market. In any case, immigration from the rest of the EU has been good for Britain's economy. The UK's growth forecasts are based, in part, on continued high levels of net migration. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility says the economy relies on migrant labour and taxes paid by immigrants to keep funding public services.The UK's net contribution to the EU, taking into account the rebate, was £11.3bn in 2013. That is more than four times what it was in 2008. It is about the same amount as the UK government spends on transport every year.Better off out: The UK would save billions in membership fees, and end the ""hidden tariff"" paid by UK taxpayers when goods are exported to the EU, caused by red tape, waste, fraud and other factors. Better off in: The UK's contribution to the EU budget is a drop in the ocean compared with the benefits to business of being in the single market. Better off out: The EU is not as important to British trade as it used to be, and continuing turmoil in the eurozone will make it even less so. Even if Britain did not manage to negotiate a free trade deal with the EU it would not be as disastrous as EU-enthusiasts claim, argues economist Roger Bootle in his book The Trouble with Europe: ""It would place the UK in the same position as the US is currently in, along with India, China and Japan, all of which manage to export to the EU relatively easily."" The UK would be free to establish bilateral trade agreements with fast-growing export markets such as China, Singapore, Brazil, Russia and India through the World Trade Organisation. Better off in: The EU is the UK's main trading partner, worth more than £400bn a year, or 52% of the total trade in goods and services. Complete withdrawal from the EU would see trade barriers erected, with car exports to the EU, for example, facing a 15% tariff and imports a tariff of 10%.  ""The idea that the UK would be freer outside the EU is based on a series of misconceptions, that a medium-sized, open economy could hold sway in an increasingly fractured trading system dominated by the US, the EU and China; that the EU makes it harder for Britain to penetrate emerging markets; and that foreign capital would be more attracted to Britain's economy if it were no longer part of the single market,"" the pro-EU Centre for European Reform said in a recent report.Better off out: The UK would remain a key part of Nato and the UN Security Council and a nuclear power, with a powerful global voice in its own right. The Eurosceptic Bruges Group wants an end to the ""discredited"" principle that Britain acts as a transatlantic bridge between the US and Europe, saying the country should make self-reliance its guiding principle.Better off in: Stripped of influence in Brussels, Berlin and Paris, Britain would find itself increasingly ignored by Washington and sidelined on big transnational issues such as the environment, security and trade. America and other allies want Britain to remain in the EU. The UK risks becoming a maverick, isolated state if it leaves.Better off out: Britain would gain full control of its own borders, with migration in and out of the country regulated solely by British law. It would be more difficult for EU citizens to move to the UK, although those already living here are unlikely to be removed. Better off in: A lot would depend on what kind of deal was reached with the other EU nations. Britons may have to apply for visas to enter EU countries and those already living there may face integration rules, such as proving they can speak the language before gaining long-term residency rights. There would also be uncertainty for many EU workers now paying taxes in the UK - what benefits, if any, would they be entitled to?Better off out: The EU has limited power over tax, which is largely a matter for national governments. The exception is VAT, which has bands agreed at the EU level. Outside the EU, the UK would potentially have more flexibility.Better off in:  ""Tax avoidance and evasion will reach crippling levels as our economy becomes increasingly wholly owned by foreign multinationals that make tax avoidance in Britain central to their business strategy,"" argued the pro-European The Observer newspaper in an editorial.Better off out: It would be a major shot in the arm for British democracy as the Westminster parliament regained its sovereignty and reconnected with voters. The country would be free from the European Arrest Warrant and other law and order measures.Better off in: Britons benefit from EU employment laws and social protections, which would be stripped away. Withdrawal from the European Arrest Warrant could mean delays for the UK in extraditing suspects from other European countries; and the UK already has some opt-outs from EU labour law, including the Working Time Directive."
2015-05-20,Mark Mardell,https://web.archive.org//web/20150524033726/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32803419,"The UK's future direction for at least a generation hangs precariously on an uncertainty, balanced on the tip of the unknown.I am talking of course about the planned referendum on the EU.  The brilliant thing about referendums, and one of the features that makes them so irksome for politicians is their binary clarity - ""Yes"" or ""No"", ""In"" or ""Out"".This one will be like that, but it isn't at the moment. For now, the most important group of potential voters are the ""Maybes"".They are not unsure because they are hesitant Harrys and Harriets who haven't grasped the big issues.It is much more political than that.  Some big names are rallying around the banner of ""Maybe"".The Foreign Secretary Phillip Hammond is one of them, and perhaps the most important is the mop-headed mayhap Boris Johnson. Their eventual decision depends, they say, on what change in the relationship David Cameron manages to negotiate - and that may well depend on what they and others argue, in political cabinet, he should demand. This is unknown because it is as yet undecided. Indeed, I am fairly sure almost all Conservative MPs will be herded into the ""Maybe"" camp by a twitch of deferent loyalty on one flank, the cracking whip of strategic cunning on the other.Those who know with certainty in their own hearts they will vote ""No"" may feel they have to give the prime minister a chance, or appear grossly disloyal. This has the added advantage that having played the part of a loyalist waiting with open-jawed admiration for the prime minister to return home with a piece of paper, their eventual disappointment will pack more heft. At the end of the process, they can declare that, despite all their high expectations, the deal is not good enough, and the obdurate EU has left them with no choice but to campaign for an ""Out"".  Equally, those who are determined to stay in might as well drape themselves in temporary Euroscepticism and mutter about how hard it is for Mr Cameron to ""squeeze anything out of that lot"".  When Mr Cameron returns with a deal, however paltry,  they can proclaim it a master stroke that forces them into the ""Yes"" camp. Still, some will have a genuine bottom line.It is not clear if the prime minister himself is one of them.He has set out, in rather loose terms, his aims, in the Sunday Telegraph last March.The trouble with most of them is that success would be difficult to measure. We will legislate in the first session of the next Parliament for an in-out referendum to be held on Britain's membership of the EU before the end of 2017. We will negotiate a new settlement for Britain in the EU. And then we will ask the British people whether they want to stay in on this basis, or leave. We will protect our economy from any further integration of the Eurozone. The integration of the Eurozone has raised acute questions for non-Eurozone countries like the UK. We benefit from the single market and do not want to stand in the way of the Eurozone resolving its difficulties.But we will not let the integration of the Eurozone jeopardise the integrity of the single market or in any way disadvantage the UK.We want to see powers flowing away from Brussels, not to it. We want national parliaments to be able to work together to block unwanted European legislation. And we want an end to our commitment to an ""ever closer union"", as enshrined in the treaty to which every EU country has to sign up.What sort of change would ensure ""businesses liberated from red tape"" or ""powers flowing away from Brussels""? Words alone would not suffice for those who think such changes are vital if the UK is to stay in the EU - after all, the European Commission would say it backs both. ""Free movement to take up work, not free benefits"" is more concrete and eminently achievable but may not look like the ""fundamental"" change in relationship that is promised. But ""new mechanisms in place to prevent vast migrations across the Continent"" looks much easier to declare as a ""win"" or ""lose"".After persistent warnings, particularly from German Chancellor Angela Merkel, that ""free movement of people"" was not up for grabs, the prime minister appeared to drop the idea. But he told the House of Commons only two months ago: ""In the coming two years, we have the opportunity to reform the EU and fundamentally change Britain's relationship with it. ""We have the opportunity to build a European Union that is more competitive, more flexible and more accountable to the people, where powers flow back to member states, not just away from them, and where freedom of movement is no longer an unqualified right.""How much would the EU have to qualify that right, to persuade the doubters?Would a promise to stop putative Serbians coming to Britain after their country joins, in perhaps 2030, do the trick? Again, that is unknown and uncertain.At the moment, most backbenchers are keeping their heads down and powder dry. But Jacob Rees Mogg, MP for North East Somerset and member of the European Scrutiny Committee in the last Parliament, told me: ""I think the touchstone for renegotiation will be the free movement of people. ""It is one of the four freedoms of the European Union, and if the EU is  willing to give ground on that it will show that it is willing to consider a fundamental reform rather than just tinkering at the edges. ""So it is symbolically important as well as representing a deep concern of the British people.""This is admirable in its clarity, and I suspect it will be a  touchstone too for many of his colleagues. Others may set the bar higher or lower, but one new MP told me: ""I wouldn't like to be in the prime minister's shoes.""He knows it has to be real - he can't just come back with a bit of polish on it."" The prime minister's challenge is to come back with a deal so bright and sunny that the snows of uncertainty melt away to reveal the sunny uplands of victory. Is that likely? Maybe."
2015-05-20,Peer problems?,https://web.archive.org//web/20150524033726/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32725118,"When David Cameron heads to the House of Lords for the Queen's Speech later this month he might want to cast his eye along the red benches. Sitting there will be scores of peers who - when the ermine robes are off and Parliament gets back to business - could start causing a bit of trouble for the government.Managing Mr Cameron's small majority in the Commons - 12 MPs - is going to require some skill from the party whips. But it could turn out to be an easy day at the office compared with handling the complicated mechanics of the Lords where the Conservatives aren't even close to a majority.The numbers - see below - don't add up for the prime minister in the ""upper chamber"".Together, Labour and the Lib Dems have 315 peers - enough to beat the Conservatives by 91 votes. Then there are the crossbench - or independent - peers to think about.  They're hard to predict as they don't vote as a block.  In the worst-case scenario for the Conservatives, their 224 peers are up against a whopping 555 from other parties and groups. On the other hand the crossbenchers could, in theory, help the Conservatives win.  As Professor Meg Russell, Director of the Constitution Unit at University College London, notes: ""The Conservatives are in a relatively weak position in the Lords, holding less than a third of seats. The government can readily be defeated by various combinations of other forces.""Policies that could stir up objections in the Lords include abolishing the Human Rights Act and legislation paving the way for an EU referendum. It's very unusual for peers to vote against an entire Bill. Their style is to go through legislation amending bits they don't like. The government can either accept the changes or overturn them in the Commons. Maybe David Cameron will start wishing he'd pushed on with plans, three years ago, to introduce elected peers. He abandoned the proposals in the face of opposition from Conservative MPs and peers. It was another reprieve for the House of Lords, which has survived numerous attempts at reform over the last 100 years.And there won't be another existential crisis for the time being. The Conservative election manifesto states that they see a ""strong case"" for introducing an ""elected element"" but ""it isn't a priority in the next Parliament"".With wounds to lick and new leaders to choose, Lib Dem and Labour strategists aren't thinking too deeply about their tactics in the  Lords. But as politicians drift back to Westminster the possibilities are starting to bleep on the political radar.Labour peer Lord Foulkes has already been tweeting about what he calls the ""difficult job"" facing the Leader of the Lords, Baroness Stowell, whose task is to get government business through.He predicts ""interesting times"", saying: ""Labour and the Liberal Democrats have a huge majority over the Conservatives. The crossbenchers are unpredictable but on a number of occasions they have come with us. The Lib Dems in the Lords are old-fashioned Lib Dems. They'll be happier working with us than the Tories.""The Liberal Democrats are leading lights in the campaign to turn the House of Lords into an elected chamber. It's a cruel irony that with only eight MPs, the Lib Dems will be relying on an institution they dislike to give them a solid platform at Westminster.How will they get along with their former coalition partners though? The Lib Dem peer, Baroness Hussein-Ece, said the Conservatives were now ""off the leash"" but wouldn't be getting ""an easy ride"".""The dynamics are going to be completely different. We will take things on a policy-by-policy basis. I feel quite passionately about keeping the Human Rights Act and I'm pretty sure that my colleagues will be opposing abolition vociferousIy.""But David Cameron can take some comfort from the fact that the Lib Dems will not be falling into Labour's arms. Baroness Hussein-Ece is certain there will be issues the two parties can agree on but is equally sure they will not form a happy union as a matter of course. She said: ""I'm afraid that the Labour Party is more interested in tribal politics. It could have conducted itself in a more progressive way during the election."" In the last Parliament, the coalition government was defeated 103 times in the Lords and a Labour source in the Lords predicts that the Conservatives will ""want to make up for lost time"". He said: ""What we anticipate is that they will start to look back at the concessions they made and the opposition amendments that got through.""And the feeling is that the government will find ways to use secondary legislation - which empowers ministers to adjust some laws.By convention, the House of Lords is reluctant to challenge policies promised in election manifestos and doesn't vote against measures on taxation and spending. But Professor Russell thinks the rules around those conventions are ""far from clear"" and that Labour and the Lib Dems might be tempted to block what they see as Conservative ""austerity"" measures. Meg Russell says: ""The House of Lords is a complicated place. Historically at least, they have always been very sensitive to public opinion. They are not likely to go in all guns blazing.""How can David Cameron deal with trouble in the Lords - even if it is well-meaning and principled?He can't get rid of any peers but he could, in theory, create a huge number of new Conservative peers to give him a stronger base. ""There are no rules,"" Meg Russell adds of the possibility. ""The prime minister has complete patronage. But of course it wouldn't go down well with the  public and there would be an outcry in Parliament.""And introducing too many new peers would also be embarrassing because the Conservatives have promised to tackle the size of the chamber. With 779 active members, it's one of the largest in the world.The Conservative Lord Cormack thinks that the prime minister shouldn't worry too much because he can rely on the Lords to behave ""with a considerable degree of sense"".""There will be stormy patches and it's always over the things that you don't predict,"" he says. ""But the important thing to do is play to the strengths of the Lords. There's an enormous accumulation of wisdom and experience. It generally improves bills."" He is relaxed about the next few years. ""I don't anticipate any unpleasantness. For the government to be defeated in the House of Lords isn't the end of the world."" And that's because, he said, the Lords believes in the supremacy of the Commons.It may be a while before the new dynamics in the Lords play out. The first bills will be unveiled in the Queen's Speech on 27th May and any controversial ones may not reach the House of Lords until after the summer break.But there's one other constitutional niggle to mention. In theory, all parties should be represented in the House of Lords - even the small ones. The Greens have one peer and UKIP has three. But there are no members of the SNP in the House of Lords. And with 56 MPs, it means the Lords isn't speaking for millions of people in Scotland. The SNP is adamant, though, that it doesn't want anything to do with the place.With the Lords potentially a powerful force, are the Scottish Nationalists missing a trick?Not according to the SNP MP Pete Wishart who declared: ""It's an affront to democracy. We will have nothing to do with this democratic outrage. The House of Lords doesn't need reform. We need to abolish it and start again."""
2015-05-20,Olive branches or burning bridges?,https://web.archive.org//web/20150524033726/http://www.bbc.com/news/education-32796618,"When Nicky Morgan became education secretary last year her biggest strength and biggest problem were the same thing - not being Michael Gove.Her predecessor had cast a long shadow, having dominated the education landscape and in many ways re-made it in his own likeness.Mrs Morgan was introduced as a less confrontational figure, offering an olive branch to a teaching profession that had felt that it was being used for target practice.But many of the questions she faced were about how she defined herself against the Gove legacy, rather than about her own vision.Now she is back under her own steam, authority enhanced and able to stamp her own identity on the Department for Education.So what will be the direction of schools in England under Mrs Morgan? Will it be more olive branches? Or will it be more burning bridges?The first education bill of the new Parliament promises to create hundreds of academies and free schools, with plans to replace the leadership of schools that are struggling. So no surprises there, it's going to be more of the same.And it will raise the same questions about whether structural change really raises standards.But so much of this debate is about the rhetoric rather than the reality - and head teachers have been bristling at the language of threats to send in teams of new leaders to ""failing and coasting schools"".Heads' leaders have been irritated that the public discourse is already so negative.And they ask where are all these armies of superstar replacement heads waiting to be ""parachuted"" into schools?The ""coasting school"" motif really irritates them, not least because it's such a vague term, leaving many heads unsure whether they should be looking over their shoulder.But maybe they should see it as part of the cycle of government.""Hundreds of schools in England which are considered to be 'coasting' are facing a government crackdown."" This was a story from 2007, with an almost identical threat of such lacklustre schools being taken over.And it wasn't even new then. ""The school standards watchdog in England is to crack down on 'coasting' schools"". That was from 1999 - and it annoyed head teachers then too.It's also worth noting that Ofsted at the same time announced that schools would only receive from six to 10 working weeks' notice of an inspection, instead of two terms. It's now less than one day's notice.And schools are still ""coasting"".One of the balancing acts for Mrs Morgan will be how to keep school leaders on board, as serious professional partners, when at the same time the political language about education often reverts into accusations and threats.Heads say they are facing big practical pressures in the next five years - hundreds of thousands of extra pupils needing places, fears of a shortage of teachers and head teachers, and worries about over-stretched budgets.Constantly talking about academies seems an ideological sideshow to them.And the engagement of heads will be crucial in what is going to be a major task for the next five years - rolling out the curriculum and qualifications reforms announced under the previous coalition government. There are bound to be some unforeseen bumps, and downright craters, in this delivery phase.Mrs Morgan has promised that the next five years will see an end to ""constant change"". There was a strong message to teachers during the election campaign that there would be more bedding in and less uprooting.And that means finding a way to avoid any more headline-grabbing changes, without looking like this is an administration that is becalmed. She'll have to show that less is more.But there are still questions to be decided which will be seen as symbolic. Not least about whether to allow a Kent grammar school to open a satellite branch in another town.Speaking privately, heads' leaders say there seems to be a balancing act.Mrs Morgan is described as being much more accessible and wanting a better relationship with the teaching profession - and the atmosphere in the Department for Education is described as ""completely different"" than in the Gove era.They describe ministers as being ""very upbeat"".But head teachers still bridle at what seems to be a very different political tone, that they criticise as negative towards schools, lacking in evidence and counter-productive.Good cop, bad cop? Mrs Morgan now has the chance to establish her own classroom style."
2015-05-20,New-look Commons,https://web.archive.org//web/20150524033726/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32795139,"MPs are back at Westminster to be sworn in as the new Parliament gets under way. But what's new this time around? Here are some things to look out for:Television viewers will get a new perspective on our politicians, thanks to eye-level cameras in the Commons. Approved by the House of Commons Commission in February, the cameras offer an alternative to the traditional high-level fixed positions to which viewers have become accustomed over the years. It comes after TV cameras were allowed into previously forbidden parts of the Palace of Westminster for the BBC's Inside the Commons documentary.The number of women in Parliament has risen by about a third to 191. Female MPs now make up 29% of the overall total. The proportion of female Conservative and Labour MPs has increased, despite an overall fall in the number of Labour MPs. But the biggest rise in female representation in the Commons came from the Scottish National Party, which now has 20 female MPs, up from just one.Labour MP Sir Gerald Kaufman is the new Father of the House, the title given to the MP with the longest continuous service who is not a minister.The member for Manchester Gorton replaces Conservative Sir Peter Tapsell, who stood down as MP at the election. His main duty, as demonstrated on Monday, is to preside over the election of a new Speaker.First elected in 1970, Sir Gerald pips three other MPs - Conservatives Ken Clarke and Michael Meacher, and Dennis Skinner of Labour, who all entered Parliament on the same day - because he swore the oath before them.Labour's acting leader Harriet Harman appointed herself to the unofficial title after pointing out she was the longest-serving female MP in the Commons. The MP for Camberwell and Peckham, first elected in 1982, made the comments during the Speaker's election exchanges, ""to prevent us all from falling headlong into patriarchy"" and promised ""good parenting"" along with Mr Kaufman.At 20 years of age, the SNP's Mhairi Black is the UK's youngest elected MP since 1667.The MP for Paisley and Renfrewshire South, who ousted shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander, found herself surrounded by Labour MPs on the green benches during the Speaker election. The politics student - who worked part-time in a chip shop before winning her seat - has been studying for her final exams in the House of Commons of Library, she revealed in an ITV interview.The influx of SNP MPs has led to some competition on the Labour benches. This was illustrated during the Speaker election as Labour MPs found themselves displaced from their familiar spots when the nationalists arrived early to bag their places. But Labour veteran Dennis Skinner held on to his traditional seat on the front corner of the far opposition bench. The Bolsover MP was spotted wedged in next to the SNP's Chris Law. ""I only had half a cheek on, but I was there before them and I will be there when they are gone,"" he told the Mirror. There are said to be just 427 seats available for MPs, and backbenchers use their prayer cards to guarantee a spot.The Liberal Democrats have been hardest hit by the new seating arrangements, with their eight MPs positioned in a distant corner of the opposition benches. It's a far cry from the days of coalition, when the likes of Nick Clegg and Danny Alexander regularly fielded questions from the despatch box.Aside from the prospect of a new Labour leader grilling Prime Minister David Cameron, the SNP will also get two questions in the weekly Parliamentary showpiece because of its third party status. Moray MP Angus Robertson, the party's Westminster leader, will get the role previously filled by the Liberal Democrats before the coalition government.The new House of Commons is more ethnically diverse than ever, with 41 non-white MPs, up from 27. And for the first time, there is an MP of Chinese origin - Alan Mak, who represents Havant for the Conservatives.Stephen Kinnock, son of former Labour leader Neil, is now an MP for the party. So is Rupa Huq, the sister of former Blue Peter presenter Konnie Huq, and Tulip Siddiq, whose aunt, Sheikh Hasina, is the prime minister of Bangladesh.The new House has 32 gay, lesbian and bisexual MPs - more than in any Parliament in any other country. According to an analysis for the New Statesman, 13 of these are Labour, and 12 are Conservative.For the first time since 1885, there are no former prime ministers anywhere in Parliament. Labour's Gordon Brown stood down at the general election, and neither of his two predecessors, Tony Blair and John Major, took seats in the House of Lords.The elections aren't over in the House of Commons, where chairmen and women have to be voted in to lead most of the Commons select committees.The committees, covering subjects like home affairs, health and transport, have an increasingly high-profile role in holding the government to account, carrying out inquiries, taking evidence from witnesses and publishing reports. Some committees, like foreign affairs and culture, media and sport, are guaranteed a new name in charge because the former holder has left Parliament or been promoted to the government.One thing that hasn't changed, to some people's surprise, is the occupant of the Speaker's chair. John Bercow was re-elected unopposed when MPs returned after the election, despite efforts by the Conservatives to make it easier for him to be unseated at the very end of the last Parliament. Meanwhile, there will be at least one new deputy Speaker - Labour MP Dawn Primarolo stood down, and elections will be held for each of the deputy posts in the coming weeks."

2015-05-21,PM announces freeze in ministers' pay,https://web.archive.org//web/20150524033726/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32863296,"Government ministers' pay will remain frozen for the next five years, David Cameron has announcedWriting in the Sunday Times, the prime minister said we were ""all in this together"" when it came to paying off the national debt.His pledge will save about £800,000 a year and £4m by 2020.The decision means ministerial pay will not have risen for a decade by the end of parliament. Cabinet ministers currently receive a salary of £134,565.This includes their pay as MPs. The prime minister is paid a total of £142,500.Mr Cameron said his decision to freeze ministerial pay for the duration of the parliament was part of his ""One Nation"" approach to tackling the deficit, and becoming a country where ""all hard-working people can get on"".He writes: ""We can't pretend there's not still a long way to go. We've halved the deficit as a share of the economy - but there's still half of it left to pay off.""So we will continue to take the difficult decisions necessary to bring spending down and secure our economy. As we go about doing that, I want people to be in no doubt: I said five years ago we were all in this together, and five years on, nothing has changed.""That's why, for example, I've decided to freeze the pay of the ministers in the government. For me, that's just one step which sends out a clear signal: that as we continue knuckling down as a country, we will all play our part.""Meanwhile, the UK's 650 MPs - who are currently paid £67,060 - are in line for a 9% pay rise later this year after the independent watchdog - known as the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA) -  said pay should rise to £74,000 after the election.Changes brought in after the 2009 expenses scandal mean MPs are no longer in charge of setting their own pay rates, instead this issue now falls within the purview of IPSA.But the government has made it clear that the scale of the IPSA's suggested increase is ""not right"" and should be reconsidered, given that public sector pay rises have been capped at 1%.Is this a surprise? No. Will it save much money? No. Is it symbolically important to the point that it would have been more newsworthy if they'd not done this? Absolutely. The prime minister acknowledges that there are ""difficult decisions"" to come, so this is important symbolically to try to prove, as he puts it, that ""we are all in this together."" What is likely to prove much more tricky is the expected big rise coming soon in the basic pay all MPs receive.After the expenses scandal, parliament decided MPs' pay should be set by an independent body. But always beware the law of unintended consequences: that body could now recommend, against the vociferous protests of the party leaders, a big hike in their pay packets.MPs are also not paid extra for their committee work, although committee chairs get a £14,000 supplement, taking their pay to £81,642.Ahead of Wednesday's Queen's Speech setting out his priorities for the first year of his new term, Mr Cameron used his newspaper column to insist that his new administration would be ""about so much more than balancing the books"".""As we return to office, after five years of a long-term economic plan and sacrifices by the British people, we're on the brink of something different - something special,"" he writes.""We can become a country where all hard-working people can get on; not a two-speed society where some can afford childcare and homes of their own and others cannot.""We can become a country where all children get the education they deserve and no-one settles for a life on benefits; so no-one's background is a barrier to their success.""In other words, we can become One Nation."""
2015-05-21,Cameron urged to make case for EU,https://web.archive.org//web/20150524033726/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32857711,"David Cameron is being urged to make a positive case for Europe if he wants to successfully renegotiate the UK's terms of membership with fellow EU leaders.Pascal Lamy, one of Europe's most senior politicians, told the BBC other leaders wanted to help Mr Cameron win a referendum but he has to help himself.Mr Lamy was director general of the World Trade Organization for 13 years.The PM has pledged to renegotiate a ""better deal"" for the UK and hold an ""in-out"" referendum by the end of 2017.Meanwhile, the Labour Party's acting leader Harriet Harman has said her party has officially dropped its opposition to holding a referendum on the issue.In an interview to be broadcast on BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend later, Mr Lamy - who now heads up the think tank Notre Europe - said he did not agree with the view ""that the Brits have always been a pain in the ass so they can leave and it would be fine"". He said the prime minister started with some credit because of his election victory.""[David Cameron] won an election in a reasonably brilliant way as a politician, as a professional of politics he did a good job and these guys are in the same job and they recognise that"", he said.""There are issues of substance, but the psychology of that matters very much.""  He warned there would be some red lines, such as free movement of people but there was a ""margin of manoeuvre"" over this and exempting the UK from ""ever closer union"". He suggested Mr Cameron's tone would be important.""Most European leaders, including myself, feel David Cameron needs to be able to make a good case for Europe in the referendum.""They need to help them but he himself must make a pro-EU case in the UK, which frankly hasn't been done for the last 15 years.""There has to be some change to the UK narrative, which will probably be the price for a compromise."" Mr Lamy said if Britain left, it would be bad news for the EU. He said in his previous jobs, he found world leaders, like the presidents of China and Brazil, felt the EU was founded on two miracles - peace between France and Germany, and British membership.""Half of the miracle would evaporate if the Brits were to leave the European Union,"" he added.On Friday, the prime minister admitted he has not found himself surrounded by a ""wall of love"", as he put it - but he will find Europe's leaders are willing to help him construct a ladder to hop over the high fence he has built for himself.Labour's Harriet Harman has also said her party would now support David Cameron's planned referendum bill, clearing a path for a ballot by the end of 2017.Writing in the Sunday Times, Ms Harman said: ""We have now had a general election and reflected on the conversations we had on doorsteps throughout the country. The British people want to have a say on the UK's membership of the European Union. ""Labour will therefore now support the EU referendum bill when it comes before the House of Commons.""But she added that although her party was no longer opposing a referendum, Labour would still be campaigning for the UK to remain part of the union.As a high profile, fervent believer in European integration Mr Pascal's words are important - and suggest the European establishment want to give Mr Cameron a deal that will help him win a referendum.If Mr Cameron failed it would inflict a grave, potentially fatal, wound on a project already under assault from numerous directions. They will have their own red lines of course, but Mr Cameron's biggest problem may well come at home. He faces Goldilocks' porridge problem - what is suitable to sup for European leaders may prove too tepid for backbenchers. What is the right temperature for them, is likely to burn lips on the continent. Seeking a deal that is ""just right"" will not be easy.David Cameron is ready to start renegotiating the terms of Britain's EU membership ahead of a referendum.

In that time he learned his brief, gained the ­experience, handled the media and won the public's trust with an overwhelming landslide.""I have seen a lot of those skills and ­qualities in Andy Burnham during his 13 years as an MP.""Many people talk about aspiration but Andy is a living example - a working-class lad from Liverpool who went to a ­comprehensive and got a place at Cambridge University.

2015-05-21,Apprenticeship system 'fails young',https://web.archive.org//web/20150524033726/http://www.bbc.com/news/education-32844164,"The apprenticeship system in Britain is ""failing"" and needs reform to address youth unemployment, a new report says. The study, commissioned by the Local Government Association, found 42% of all apprenticeships created in the last five years went to people aged over 25.It said current policy enabled businesses to train established workers rather than unemployed young people.The government said the number of young people not in work, education or training was at its lowest in a decade.It has pledged to create a further three million apprenticeships before the end of Parliament in 2020.   The report, by the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) and the Local Government Association (LGA), found 67% of intermediate-skilled apprentices were already employed by their company when they were given their apprenticeships. The study also said demand for apprenticeships - particularly among young people - had soared, with one million people applying for 85,000 vacancies last year.This was despite two million apprenticeships starting over the last Parliament, the report said. In 2013-14 under-19s applied for 57% of the advertised apprenticeships but were given 27% of them, whereas over-25s made up 7% of applications but filled 37% of the vacancies. The study's authors said the government needed to undertake ""significant reform"" of the apprenticeship system, which they said was ""failing to get to grips with stubbornly high levels of youth unemployment"".Luke Raikes, research fellow at IPPR North, said: ""A high quality apprenticeship system could be used to combat youth unemployment and drive higher productivity, but the system we currently have is failing to deliver.""There is a big gap between the function apprenticeships should have in our economy and how they're being used in practice: the majority of apprenticeships are being used to train older people, and those who are already employed at their company, instead of taking on young people out of work.""Just over a third of apprenticeships created in the last five years were at advanced or higher level, with the majority of places being at the intermediate level.And 24% of 16-18 year olds, and 15% of all intermediate apprentices were not being paid the minimum wage, the report said. Pay was particularly low in hairdressing and childcare, where 42% and 26% of apprentices were paid less than the minimum wage. The report said local apprenticeship hubs should be created and given full control of the apprenticeship grant from central government. This would enable employers to tailor the apprenticeship offer to better meet the needs of local employers and the local economy, it said.Powers and budgets for apprenticeships should also be further devolved to local authorities.   Cllr Peter Box, economy spokesman for the LGA, said: ""A good apprenticeship can give young people the experience, skills and understanding that can often lead straight into a full-time job. ""At present, too many new apprenticeships are low skilled and taken by older people already in work with their employer."""
2015-05-21,Email error reveals bank's EU project,https://web.archive.org//web/20150524033726/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32856698,"The Bank of England has confirmed it is researching the financial risks of the UK leaving the EU after it ""inadvertently"" sent details of its work to a national newspaper.A senior official sent an email about its confidential project on the issue to an editor at the Guardian newspaper.A spokesman for the bank described the error as ""unfortunate"".Prime Minister David Cameron has promised an in/out referendum on the UK's EU membership by the end of 2017.Labour's shadow chancellor Chris Leslie called for ""a full and informed debate, not clandestine processes shrouded from public view"".The email indicates a small group of senior staff are to examine the economic effects of the UK leaving the EU under the authority of Sir Jon Cunliffe, who is the deputy director for financial stability, the Guardian says.The email also spells out that should anyone ask about the project - codenamed Project Bookend - the taskforce should say it concerns ""a broad range of European economic issues"", and not make any reference to the forthcoming referendum.By BBC business correspondent Joe LynamImagine the outrage if - the morning after Britain had voted to quit the EU - the Bank of England put out a statement saying: ""We start work today on how 'Brexit' might affect the markets and UK firms.""  First of all we'd ask why do we pay these people to react rather than pre-empt massive outcomes. Secondly it might have already been too late.  There might have been a huge sell-off in sterling. Government bonds - known as gilts - might have plunged in value, meaning the cost of borrowing for the Treasury might have soared overnight.Britain's major listed companies might have seen billions wiped off their value in early trading.Of course none of that might happen. Markets might have been very sanguine about quitting the EU. But we don't know and the only way the Bank of England would know was if it did some quiet preparatory work - outside the glare of publicity.That latter hope is now forlorn.The email, from Sir Jon Cunliffe's private secretary to four senior executives, was written on 21 May, the Guardian reported.James Talbot, the head of the monetary assessment and strategy division, was also involved in Project Bookend, the paper said.The email is quoted as saying: ""Jon's proposal, which he has asked me to highlight to you, is that no email is sent to James's team or more broadly around the Bank about the project.""James can tell his team that he is working on a short-term project on European economics in International [division] which will last a couple of months. This will be in-depth work on a broad range of European economic issues. Ideally he would then say no more.""The memo goes on to propose that questions from ""other parties"" about ""whether this was a project to look at the referendum"", should be given the answer, ""that there is a lot going on in Europe in the next couple of months - pointing to some of the specific European economic issues (eg: Greece) that would be of concern to the Bank"".A statement from the bank said: ""Today, information related to planned confidential Bank work on the potential implications of a renegotiation and national referendum on the UK's membership of the European Union made its way into the public domain, due to an internal email sent inadvertently to an external party.""There are a range of economic and financial issues that arise in the context of the renegotiation and national referendum.  It is one of the Bank's responsibilities to assess those that relate to its objectives.""It is not sensible to talk about this work publicly, in advance. But as with work done prior to the Scottish referendum, we will disclose the details of such work at the appropriate time.""While it is unfortunate that this information has entered the public domain in this way, the Bank will maintain this approach.""David Cameron is ready to start renegotiating the terms of Britain's EU membership ahead of a referendum. Here is some further reading on what it all means: The UK and the EU: Better off in or out?What Britain wants from EuropeQ&A: The UK's planned EU referendumTimeline: EU referendum debateWhy Germany is David Cameron's new best friendMr Leslie, who was appointed shadow chancellor after Ed Balls' election defeat, told the BBC the email raised questions about whether the report would be published, if so when, and whether businesses, the Treasury or the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) would be consulted and whether the chancellor knew about the assessment.Mark Taylor, a former IMF economist and researcher at the Bank of England, said the bank would have kept the project secret to avoid being pulled into the referendum debate politically and bias David Cameron's discussions as he renegotiates the terms of EU membership.Furthermore, if the UK does leave the union, a set of bilateral agreements would have to be negotiated so the bank would want to ""keep its cards close to its chest"", he added.He said the accidental email was ""a bit Dad's Army"", quite endearing but hadn't done any ""real damage"". Conservative former Cabinet minister Owen Paterson, a prominent eurosceptic, said the Bank's project should include the option of remaining in the European Economic Area without being a member of the EU.""If the Bank does look at those very optimistic options, that is thoroughly worthwhile and I hope they will make those investigations public,"" he told the Today programme.""It isn't either 'remain in the European Union or leap into the darkness'; there are other options,"" he added.BBC business correspondent Joe Lynam said the Bank of England would have kept the project secret to avoid becoming a political ""actor"" in the referendum.The bank had appeared to be ""slightly dragged into"" the debate ahead of the referendum on Scottish independence, he said.He added that there was no evidence that talk on Twitter of it being a deliberate leak was accurate.On Friday Mr Cameron met European counterparts for the first time since his general election victory, and admitted he was ""not met with a wall of love"" as he began diplomatic negotiations aimed at securing changes to the UK's relationship with Brussels.At a summit in Riga he conceded that securing a deal would take ""patience and tenacity"" and refused to ruled out campaigning for Britain to leave the EU if his renegotiation efforts failed."
2015-05-21,Cooper warns Labour of in-fighting,https://web.archive.org//web/20150524033726/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32858845,"Yvette Cooper has warned the Labour Party against swinging too far to the left or right as it seeks to elect a new leader after the election defeat.The leadership contender said it was wrong to think ""there needs to be blood on the floor"" for Labour to rise again.Writing in the Huffington Post she said the party needs urgent changes to win elections next year in London, Wales and Scotland. Ms Cooper is one of four candidates who have put their names forward so far. The others are Andy Burnham, Liz Kendall and Mary Creagh - candidates need the signatures of 35 MPs to make it onto the ballot paper.The BBC is to host a debate between candidates on 17 June ahead of a new leader being announced on 12 September.Ms Cooper wrote: ""The mountain we now have to climb is high. But there are some who mutter that we should give up.""That there needs to be blood on the floor for the Labour Party to rise again. That we should swing our party far to the right or far to the left, then fight it out from first principles all over again.""They believe we simply can't return to office in under a decade. They advocate, not a 2020 strategy, but a vague plan to win in 2025.""But that's no good for Labour, for Britain or for those who depend on progressive change. We can't fight and win by remaining a narrow party, we have to reach out.""Ed Miliband resigned as Labour leader after the Conservatives were elected as a majority government with 331 seats in the general election. Harriet Harman has been leading Labour temporarily until a new leader is appointed but has ruled herself out of the contest.  In the same article, Ms Cooper wrote that the party had to ""face some hard truths"" and acknowledge that it could not repeat mistakes made under Ed Miliband.She also said ""there is no comfort blanket for us either in Labour victories or Labour defeats of the past"" because ""the world has changed"".Ms Cooper added: ""Acerbic critiques and the rapid washing of hands won't make Labour win again. Nor will doing what we've done before but shouting that little bit louder.""We can't repeat the narrow approach of the last five years. But nor should we think the answer is to swallow the Tory manifesto instead.""Shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt said he would not stand for the party leadership because he had struggled to find the necessary backers and instead is backing Liz Kendall's campaign.Ms Cooper has said she wants the leader election to include ""as many people as possible"" and not be a ""closed-down or polarised contest""."

The Lib Dems said no more action would be taken after the incorrect suggestion that Nicola Sturgeon wanted David Cameron to remain as prime minister.Orkney and Shetland MP Mr Carmichael said it was an error of judgement.SNP deputy leader Stewart Hosie has said the party must be held to account.He also told the BBC he understood a complaint had already been made to the parliamentary standards commissioner.SNP leader Ms Sturgeon has called for Mr Carmichael to consider his position as an MP and described the leak of the confidential memo as a ""blatant election dirty trick"".He has since accepted ""the details of the account are not correct"" and accepted ""full responsibility for the publication"".A spokesman for the Liberal Democrats said: ""Alistair has taken responsibility and has given up £17,000. The party fully supports him as MP for Orkney and Shetland.""Mr Carmichael had been entitled to receive £17,000 severance pay after losing his Cabinet position. Speaking on BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme, Mr Hosie said: ""This is really quite outrageous, and a glib apology and an error of judgement simply aren't good enough.""How can the people of Orkney and Shetland trust him? I think they have the right to go to the polls again on what we now know.""Mr Hosie added: ""We understand there has already been a complaint raised with the parliamentary standards commissioner. I would hope that would be investigated fully.""He later said: ""Mr Carmichael has no credibility in continuing as an MP and in my opinion he should stand down. It is appropriate for the Standards Commissioner to get involved and arrive at her own conclusions, having investigated the full facts.""Protests have been held in Kirkwall, Orkney, and Lerwick, Shetland, calling for Mr Carmichael to resign.The confidential memo was published by the Daily Telegraph on 3 April as the general election campaign got under way.It was written by a civil servant in the Scotland Office and claimed Ms Sturgeon told the French Ambassador to the UK, Sylvie Bermann, that she would prefer Mr Cameron, the leader of the Conservatives, to remain as prime minister.The memo also claimed Ms Sturgeon said that Ed Miliband, who was then Labour's leader, was not prime minister material.The official cabinet office inquiry into the leaking of the memo said Mr Carmichael's former special adviser Euan Roddin gave the details to the Daily Telegraph - but he had Mr Carmichael's permission to do so.Mr Carmichael said, while he had not seen the document before it was published by the newspaper, he was ""aware of its content and agreed that my special adviser should make it public""."
2015-05-21,Macintosh supporters being 'bullied',https://web.archive.org//web/20150524033726/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32857281,"Scottish Labour MSP Ken Macintosh has told BBC Scotland the ""party machine"" is bullying his supporters in an attempt to avoid a leadership contest. Mr Macintosh and party deputy leader Kezia Dugdale have confirmed that they are standing for leadership of the party when Jim Murphy quits next month.The Eastwood MSP said his supporters were being ""bullied and intimidated"" into withdrawing their backing.Scottish Labour said the leadership contest would be conducted ""fairly"".A spokesman said Mr Macintosh had since withdrawn his allegations about the party. However, Mr Macintosh insisted his comments still stood but had not been aimed at party staff.He has not named those he thinks are responsible.Scottish Labour general secretary Brian Roy said: ""I have spoken to Ken Macintosh and he has withdrawn his allegations about the party. The leadership contest in Scotland will be conducted fairly and openly.""In response, Mr Macintosh said: ""I am not withdrawing anything. I clarified with Brian [Roy] that the allegations are not against party staff, but against the machine politics which have too much influence in the Labour Party.""Mr Macintosh, the party's social justice spokesman, ran for party leadership against Johann Lamont almost four years ago and is likely to need nominations from six or seven MSPs to be a candidate in this leadership contest. Ms Dugdale, who is widely regarded as the ""obvious person"" to take on the job, confirmed her leadership bid on Friday.But he claims his backers are coming under ""incredible pressure to withdraw their support"".""I want to have a contest but I've found the whole weight of the party machine yet again turning against me trying to close down a contest,"" he told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme. ""All the people that have been trying to support me, the party machine has turned on them, and they are being put under incredible pressure to withdraw their support. They are being bullied and being intimidated and pressurised not to support me so we don't have a contest.""I wouldn't even have put my head above the parapet if I didn't know I had that support.""Mr Macintosh, who won a majority of member votes in the last leadership contest, said the three-college system used by the Labour Party to elect leaders was ""ridiculous"". ""I want the members to take control of the party,"" he said. ""We need to move to one member, one vote.""He called for a quick contest, before the summer if possible, that is ""fair and democratic"".By BBC Scotland political correspondent Glenn CampbellKezia Dugdale already has the backing of twenty Labour MSPs for her bid to become Scottish party leader. That's more than half the Labour team at Holyrood. Many of them would like her elected unopposed. Yet when she announced her intention to stand, Ms Dugdale said she would ""absolutely"" welcome a contest. Ken MacIntosh is offering that challenge. He is likely to require the support of six or seven MSPs to become a candidate. But he claims his supporters are being ""bullied and intimidated"" by what he calls the ""party machine"" in an attempt to avoid a contest. He has not been more specific. There are certainly those who think a coronation would save time and political energy and allow Labour to concentrate on the 2016 Holyrood election campaign. Others argue that a contest would allow a fuller debate about Labour's problems and possible solutions and give the new leader more authority to pursue reform. Mr Macintosh said he would campaign on fairness and social justice across the whole of Scotland with an emphasis on lifelong learning, housing and renewable energy.""The reason I think it is important that I put my views forward is I think that is all about restoring trust in the Labour Party,"" he said. ""At the last election people could not bring themselves to put their trust in Labour. I can't believe that after all these years and what we stand for.""Mr Macintosh said restoring the Scottish Labour Party required integrity, principles and honesty and ""moving away from machine politics and guile and the idea it's about power and position"".""I'm in politics to make other people's lives better, whether I'm leader or not leader, whether I'm MSP or not MSP. I am a conviction politician,"" he said.He said problems with the ""party machine"" were about ""people who want power and position and influence"", which was an ""issue for all politicians"". ""We have to remember our principles and if we can't do that we can't restore confidence in the Labour Party,"" Mr Macintosh added.Former East Renfrewshire MP Mr Murphy announced that he would resign next month after Labour's crushing general election defeat at the hands of the SNP. Ms Dugdale, the Lothian region MSP, said she welcomed a leadership contest. She has won the backing of more than half of Scottish Labour's MSPs and MP Ian Murray since announcing her intention to stand on Friday. ""I am proud to have already won the support of so many Labour colleagues in the Scottish Parliament,"" Ms Dugdale said.""The geographical spread of support I have - with MSPs from north and south, east and west - as well as the backing of MSPs from different parts of our movement shows I can bring our party together."""
2015-05-21,Balls 'not dashing back to politics',https://web.archive.org//web/20150524033726/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32852568,"Ed Balls has told the BBC he will not be ""dashing back"" to frontline politics after losing his seat at the election.He said he had wanted Labour's campaign to be more ""pro-business"" but he had backed Ed Miliband ""100%"" and he shared responsibility for the party's defeat.""In the end he didn't persuade people he could be the prime minister but I didn't persuade people I could be the chancellor either,"" said Mr Balls.He was speaking exclusively to BBC political editor Nick Robinson.In his first interview since election night, the former shadow chancellor spoke of his ""sense of loss"" at Labour' defeat and described losing his seat two weeks ago as ""a symbol of the vibrancy of our democracy"".He said: ""I always knew if the Tories won a majority I was probably a goner, but the reason I travelled 7,500 miles and went to 45 seats was because I was fighting to win."" He added: ""Politics is a brutal business,"" because ""it was a real possibility"" his party might win, and he might become chancellor.Commenting on the campaign, he said: 'I think I wanted to be more pro-business but I also backed Ed Miliband 100%. ""He was the leader I was the shadow chancellor we both worked very hard and in the end neither he or I persuaded people and we need to take our responsibility for that. It's not all on him it's on all of us.""Were you up for that Ed Balls moment - the symbol of Labour's crushing electoral defeat, the trigger for wild Tory celebrations and Labour despair?Ed Balls was in reflective mood when we spoke - looking back at what he'd achieved as much as forward to what might be next.For the rest of Nick's article and a full transcript of the interview, click here.In one of the shock results of election night, the former shadow chancellor lost his Morley and Outwood seat in West Yorkshire by 422 votes to Conservative Andrea Jenkyns.He had previously had a majority of 1,101 in the constituency on the outskirts of Leeds.Asked by Nick Robinson if he was one of the reasons Labour was unelectable, Mr Balls replied: ""Of course. ""I mean Ed Miliband said straight after the election he took responsibility but all of us have to bear our share of responsibility. ""Ed was the leader I backed him as shadow chancellor 100%. In the end he didn't persuade people he could  be the prime minister but I didn't persuade people I could be the chancellor either. I have to take that on the chin. ""People will analyse for weeks and months what happened and that's something that still feels too early for me."" Speaking about his own future, Mr Balls said: ""I'm not going to be dashing back"" to frontline politics but ""never say never"". He was, he said, embarking on ""a new chapter, outside of politics. No by-elections, not back in parliament, that is how it feels at the moment. Outside of politics is where I am going next."" He says his wife Yvette Cooper, who is running to be Labour leader, is ""brilliant and people will get a chance to see what she stands for"" but he insisted that ""I am not playing a role in her campaign"" except ""whilst she is busy I can do more to help family"".  Asked whether whether he worries that she is applying for the toughest job in British politics he said: ""You have to take your calling when it comes."" Mr Balls did not rule out appearing on Strictly Come Dancing - a prospect his wife has described as ""truly terrifying"" - but he told Nick Robinson that despite running three marathons ""I'm not sure if I'm equipped for Strictly."" He said he'd be spending his time ""cooking, running, playing the piano"" and using ""real time to stand back and think"" to write about economics.  He reflected, finally, on his image - and how he was perceived by the electorate:  ""It is very hard in politics for people to see the real you. You are seen through the prism your opponents set up.""Mr Balls' demise spelled the end of a decade in Parliament which has seen him at the heart of the Labour machine.He held the position of chief economic adviser to the Treasury in the Blair government from 1997, working on policies including Sure Start, tax credits and the national minimum wage.Ed Balls first became an MP in 2005 and a year later was made Economic Secretary to the Treasury.He was a close adviser to then-chancellor Gordon Brown and earned a reputation as a political bruiser."

Speaking at an EU summit in Latvia, he said he had not been greeted ""by a wall of love"" when he met EU leaders for the first time since his election win.But he said he had a mandate and the ""British people at his back"" for the changes he wanted to achieve.The prime minister will hold talks with Angela Merkel and EU Commission boss Jean-Claude Juncker next week.Mr Cameron will also meet French President Francois Hollande as he tries to win support for his position.Other EU countries have said they will listen to what the UK has to say, the Finnish prime minister Alexander Stubb saying he backed the UK's proposals to cut red tape and was sure ""some kind of compromise"" could be reached. But some member states have questioned the need for any change to EU treaties, something Mr Cameron has said he wants to see, and ruled out any watering down of the key principle of freedom of movement. Speaking at a meeting of EU leaders, Mr Cameron said he believed it was in the interests of both the UK and its European partners for the UK to remain part of the European Union but under different terms.The British people, he said, were not happy with the status quo and wanted change on issues such as welfare, immigration and an opt-out from further integration.Mr Cameron said he had only begun to ""scratch the surface"" of the discussions but would travel to Berlin and Paris next week as well as hosting European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker at his country residence, Chequers, on Monday.He said the British people needed ""the best possible choice"" about the UK's future in Europe and did not rule out bringing forward his promised referendum, currently scheduled to take place by the end of 2017. Mr Cameron said he expected ""lots of ups and downs"" in the process and reminding journalists that many of their pre-election forecasts were wrong, he urged them to ""wait for the result"".""I do not expect to find agreed solutions straight away,"" he told them.""These talks will require patience and tenacity. But by working together in the right spirit and sticking at it, I believe we can reform the EU and our relationship with it. And then the British people will have the final say. They will decide.""The changes he was seeking were ""deliverable and doable"", he insisted.""I've set out a series of changes which I think address the main concerns that British people have, that I have, about Europe and the way it works. And I'm confident of getting those changes.""British officials said the process was at a very early stage, but the meetings with Mrs Merkel, regarded as Germany's most powerful leader and Mr Juncker, the most senior official in Brussels, will be seen as key to setting the tone for future discussions. Mr Cameron is committed to holding an in/out referendum on Britain's membership of the EU by the end of 2017, but there is speculation it could be held next year to avoid a clash with elections in France and Germany.Legislation paving the way for the UK referendum is expected to be published next Thursday, the day after the Queen opens Parliament.Asked whether he would be prepared to recommend a UK exit if he did not get the outcome he wanted, Mr Cameron said he would ""not rule anything out"". David Cameron is ready to start renegotiating the terms of Britain's EU membership ahead of a referendum. Here is some further reading on what it all means: The UK and the EU: Better off in or out?What Britain wants from EuropeQ&A: The UK's planned EU referendumTimeline: EU referendum debateWhy Germany is David Cameron's new best friendBBC deputy political editor James Landale said Mr Cameron had used the summit, arranged to discuss the EU's relationship with Russia and its neighbours, to sound out other European leaders about what they might be willing to accept before the start of ""intricate"" negotiations in the coming months.Other EU leaders, he added, were ""scared witless"" by the possibility of the UK leaving the EU and were willing to listen and consider a deal, but there were some things - such as changes to freedom of movement rules - which were ""sacrosanct"".Mr Cameron has not revealed the full details of what he is seeking from any changes, but he is expected to demand an opt-out from one its core principles of forging an ""ever-closer union"" between member states. He will also try to get more powers to block or opt out of new EU laws, and for restrictions on welfare benefits for migrants until they have lived in the UK for four years.This week, a number of UK business leaders started to highlight the potential implications of the referendum, with the president of the CBI saying businesses should ""speak out early"" in favour of remaining in a reformed EU,The Labour Party, SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems are in favour of staying in the EU. UKIP, which got almost four million votes but only one MP in the election, want to leave."

And who is vying for the deputy leader job?Shadow health minister Liz Kendall was the first Labour MP to say they wanted a crack at the party's top job, saying a ""fundamentally new approach"" was needed.First elected to Parliament in 2010 as MP for Leicester West and appointed to the shadow front bench the same year, Ms Kendall is seen as a Blairite contender.She is a former special adviser to Harriet Harman and then Health Secretary Patricia Hewitt who has argued for reform of public services.In an interview for The House magazine in January, she said there ""will remain a role"" for private and voluntary firms in the health service, ""where they can add extra capacity to the NHS or challenge to the system"".Could she be a fresh face to lead a change of direction for Labour, or seen as too inside the Westminster bubble?The Labour MP for Leigh since 2001, Andy Burnham has plenty of government experience and is the current bookies' favourite.Mr Burnham served as health secretary under Gordon Brown and previously as culture secretary and chief secretary to the Treasury.He stood for the leadership in 2010 but lost out to Ed Miliband, going on to hold the shadow health brief under Mr Miliband's leadership. He is said to have strong trade union support.Declaring his intention to stand, he said Labour must support the ""aspirations of everyone"".Another former chief secretary to the Treasury - as well as a work and pensions minister under Gordon Brown - Yvette Cooper has been shadow home secretary for the past four years.A strong Commons performer, she has given Home Secretary Theresa May a hard time over matters including passport delays, border controls and extremism.She did not stand to succeed Mr Brown in 2010, in favour of her husband, Ed Balls.Announcing her bid this time around, she said: ""Our promise of hope wasn't strong enough to drown out the Tory and UKIP voices of fear. That's what we need to change.""The shadow international development secretary has announced her intention to join the race for the Labour leadership, via an article in the Daily MailMs Creagh joined parliament in 2005 as the MP for Wakefield, gaining experience in government as an assistant whip in 2009-10.She's also held various shadow cabinet positions in opposition, most notably as shadow secretary of state for environment, food and rural affairs - and transport.Ms Creagh held onto her brief as international development secretary in acting Labour leader Harriet Harman's recent reshuffle of the shadow cabinet.The MP for Don Valley has been Labour's shadow energy and climate change secretary since 2011, after a stint heading up the Department for Communities and Local Government.Ms Flint held on to her current position in the latest shadow cabinet reshuffle.She also held various ministerial positions during Gordon Brown's premiership, but famously resigned from as Europe minister after accusing him of treating her and her female colleagues as ""window dressing"".A former GMTV presenter, Gloria de Piero joined Parliament as the MP for Ashfield in 2010.She immediately rose to shadow ministerial ranks, taking on a culture, media and sport brief and then home affairs.Since 2013 she's been a shadow minister for women and equalities, being one of Harriet Harman's team on Labour's woman-to-woman ""pink bus"" campaign.The MP for West Bromwich since 2001. He has made a name for himself as a prominent backbench campaigner against phone hacking and child sex abuse.He also played a minor role in the toppling of Tony Blair after resigning as a defence minister and calling for the-then PM to quit in the interest of party and country.Watson became Labour's campaign chief under Ed Miliband but he quit after a he became embroiled in a row about the role of the Unite union in the candidate selection in Falkirk.Setting out his pitch for the job, he said: ""I'm seeking the deputy leadership to do one thing: write and execute the election battle plan so that our new leader will be prime minister.""The Walthamstow MP has a growing reputation as a hard-working campaigning MP. Another from the 2010 intake, she was praised for campaign against payday loans companies, and has a strong following on social media.She told the Sunday Mirror: ""Too many voters think Labour is no longer a movement for social justice but a machine that only kicks in to gear at election time.""Shadow environment secretary Angela Eagle plans to travel the country to speak to people who did the ""hard graft"" in the election campaign.The MP for Wallasey said Labour could not be ""complacent"" if it was to reverse its general election defeat.Ms Eagle, an MP since 1992, held a number of ministerial jobs during the last Labour government and in 2013 became chair of the Labour Party.She is arguably best-known for having a twin sister, Maria, who is also a Labour MP.A former journalist and Labour cabinet minister, Ben Bradshaw has been the MP for Exeter since 1997.He plans a ""big tent"" approach to ensure Labour does not miss out on votes in the south of England, saying the party has to ""broaden its appeal"".Reflecting on who should replace Ed Miliband, he said: ""I would prefer to see one of the new generation come forward rather than someone associated with the Blair and Brown era.""If we really want to win in 2020 - and I think we need to for the country's sake -  I would like to see someone from the new generation without that baggage from the past.""The MP for Tottenham was the first person to publicly weigh up a leadership bid, telling the BBC that he would consider standing if colleagues wanted him to.But he's ruled himself out of the top job, saying his principal aim is to become Labour's candidate for Mayor of London in 2016.""I think we need a leader that can win back the Midlands understand Scotland as well as the south.""Actually we need to do better in London, my strengths are in London and the south therefore I want to be the Labour candidate for Mayor,"" he told the BBC's Daily Politics programme.One of the most prominent black MPs in the party, the former former barrister is regarded as being on the right of the party, having served as a minister under both Tony Blair and Gordon Brown.His national profile rose during the 2011 riots in London, when he appealed for calm and reconciliation in the wake of the fatal shooting of Mark Duggan in his north London constituency. Dame Tessa Jowell was a key figure at the heart of New Labour - she once said she would ""jump under a bus"" for Tony Blair.The former Dulwich and West Norwood MP, who stood down at the general election after 20 years in Parliament, earned widespread plaudits for the role she played in London's bid for the 2012 Olympics and her subsequent performance as Olympics minister.She has vowed to bring ""Olympic-like discipline"" to changing London, promising to build more affordable homes.The former culture secretary, who was a psychiatric social worker before entering politics, is seen as one of the frontrunners in the race to be Labour's mayoral candidate, with one poll suggesting she is backed by 40% of Labour supporters.Sadiq Khan launched his bid to be London mayor with an attack on incumbent Boris Johnson, describing him as a ""red carpet mayor, somebody who is fantastic going to openings, great with a flute of champagne in his hands"".""I'd rather roll up my sleeves and fight for all Londoners,"" he added.The son of a bus driver, Mr Khan worked as a human rights solicitor before becoming an MP in 2005. He is shadow London minister.A close ally of former Labour leader Ed Miliband, Mr Khan served in junior ministerial roles in Gordon Brown's government.A familiar face to viewers of BBC One's This Week, Diane Abbott is a veteran left winger who first entered the Commons in 1987, as one of Britain's first black MPs.The Hackney North and Stoke Newington MP was shadow public health spokesman under Ed Miliband, after losing out to him in the 2010 Labour leadership contest.Launching her mayoral bid, she said she would bring London's communities together and be the ""genuinely independently minded Mayor that London needs"".""Hard times call for a campaigning Mayor. Now more than ever our city needs a Mayor who will stand up for the interests of those increasingly left behind,"" she added.A journalist and railway historian, Christian Wolmar is one of Britain's most in-demand transport pundits.The only non-politician in the race, he campaigns against the construction of HS2 and has vowed to tackle London's ""housing crisis"", improve the transport network and revitalise public spaces.""Instead of partisan and personality politics London needs a dedicated, ideas driven mayor who works for Londoners and their needs,"" he said.The 65-year-old cycles to campaign meeting and claims to have clocked up more than 2,000 miles already.Chuka Umunna was the second candidate to declare he would stand for election as leader of the Labour Party.A rising star of the party, Mr Umunna was first elected to Parliament in 2010 and appointed shadow business secretary the following year.He has retained the seat of Streatham with a majority of nearly 14,000 and a vastly increased vote share this time round.He announced his intention to stand via a post on his Facebook page. He said he had spoken to half the Labour 80 candidates standing in Tory seats targeted by the party and other MPs before making his announcement. However, three days later Mr Umunna withdrew from the leadership contest. He said in a statement posted on his Twitter feed that had been uncomfortable with the level of ""sheer pressure"" and scrutiny that came with being a candidate.The 36-year-old added that it had perhaps been ""too soon"" for him to launch a leadership bid.Another rising star of the 2010 intake, the MP for Leeds West was appointed shadow chief secretary to the Treasury in 2011 and shadow work and pensions secretary in 2013.During the election campaign, she attacked the so-called bedroom tax, whereby housing benefit payments are reduced for tenants in council and social housing deemed to have spare rooms.However, she also suggested Labour would consider reducing the overall welfare cap in some areas.She told BBC News Labour needs ""to be in the centre ground to win a general election"" but ruled herself out of a leadership bid.A former home secretary and shadow chancellor, Alan Johnson is the Labour leadership candidate who never quite was.The popular MP declined to stand in 2010 and stepped down from his shadow cabinet role in 2011 for personal reasons.Earlier this year it was reported that senior New Labour figures Lord Mandelson and Alistair Campbell approached Mr Johnson over a leadership bid, although all three later distanced themselves from the story.But the former postman, who has been MP for Hull West and Hessle since 1997, had seemingly ruled himself out again, saying it is a ""10-year job"" and he does not have the ""right qualities"". Former army officer Dan Jarvis was elected MP for Barnsley Central in a by-election in 2011, having resigned his commission as a major in the Parachute Regiment to contest the seat.He held onto his seat at the general election, taking time out from campaigning to run the London Marathon last month.After entering Parliament in 2010, he quickly became a shadow culture, media and sport minister and later a shadow justice minister.In 2011, Mr Jarvis became the first serving politician in more than 60 years to be awarded a military honour, when he was made an MBE for his services to the armed forces.He has been touted by some colleagues as a future Labour leader but Mr Jarvis, who was widowed in 2010 and has a young family, ruled himself out, saying it is not the ""right time"" for him and his family. Historian and journalist Tristram Hunt entered Parliament in 2010 as Labour MP for Stoke-on-Trent Central.Ed Miliband made him shadow education secretary in 2013 and he has been a fierce critic of the coalition's education policies in England.Speaking in the aftermath of the election results, he called on Labour's ruling National Executive Committee ""not to rush our election"", saying there was time for a ""brutal post-mortem"" about Labour's ""underlying philosophy and thinking"".As for his own ambitions, he said ""it's about the lyrics as much as the lead singer I think"".He later said he was not confident of getting enough nominations to stand, and would support Liz Kendall.The MP for Rochdale says the deputy leader vacancy has ""come a bit too soon"" for him.He previously said a number of colleagues had asked him to put his name forward for the role.Mr Danczuk is well known for his prominent campaigning against child sex abuse and leading calls for an inquiry into allegations of historical child sex abuse by senior figures at Westminster.He was a vocal critic of Ed Miliband and in an article for the Daily Telegraph on Thursday he said Labour needed to ""step out if its Metropolitan comfort zone"" and ""reach out to the country once more.""The former director of public prosecutions has only just become an MP after being elected in Frank Dobson's old seat of Holborn and St Pancras, in North London at the general election.He was forced to rule himself out of the race to be Labour leader following a social media campaign urging him to stand.He said he was ""flattered"" by the campaign but the party needed someone with ""more political experience"".The older brother of ex-leader Ed, David Miliband was frontrunner to replace Gordon Brown in 2010, until his sibling beat him by a whisker.A former foreign secretary and MP for South Shields, he was the Blairite choice for leader but eventually quit Parliament to become head of the International Rescue Committee charity in New York in 2013.Speaking to the BBC from the US on the Monday after the general election, Mr Miliband criticised his brother's campaign in the 2015 general election, saying he and Mr Brown had ""allowed themselves to be portrayed as moving backwards from the principles of aspiration and inclusion that are the absolute heart of any successful progressive political project"".While he acknowledged the two men were ""brothers for life"", he also confirmed he was not eligible to stand for the party leadership as he is not an MP.Labour's election rulesMPs wishing to stand as leader and deputy leader have to be nominated by 15% of their colleagues in the Parliamentary Labour Party to be eligible to stand.As Labour now has 232 MPs, this means prospective candidates must get at least 34 signatures. That means the maximum size of any field is six contenders.Under rules agreed last year, all Labour Party members, registered supporters and affiliated supporters - including union members - will be allowed a maximum of one vote each on a one member, one vote system. When the election is held, they will be asked to rank candidates in order of preference.If no candidate gets 50% of all votes cast, the votes will be added up and the candidate with the fewest votes eliminated. Their 2nd preference votes will then be redistributed until one candidate has 50% of all votes cast."
2015-05-21,What Britain wants from Europe,https://web.archive.org//web/20150524033726/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32695399,"David Cameron says he has a mandate to pursue EU reform following the Conservatives' general election victory. The PM, who will be hoping his majority government will give him extra leverage in Brussels, wants to renegotiate the terms of the UK's membership ahead of a referendum by the end of 2017. He has said he will campaign for Britain to remain in the EU if he gets the reforms he wants.Mr Cameron has said he does not want to reveal full details of his negotiating hand but he has given a broad indication, in a series of speeches and newspaper articles, of his priorities when he goes into talks with other EU leaders.These are: The prime minister has said Britain would resist any move towards a European Army and that he wants to free British police forces from EU interference. He has also ruled out Britain joining the euro.But he has placed less emphasis in recent years on demanding changes to EU social policy, such as the maximum 48-hour working week, agency workers, maternity leave and non-discrimination rules.The official UK government position is that a referendum will be held by the end of 2017 but Downing Street sources have said: ""If we can do it earlier we will.""There is speculation David Cameron is planning to hold the vote in 2016 to avoid a clash with French and German elections in 2017.The prime minister wants treaty change but even if the referendum was held in 2017 there may not be enough time to legally incorporate any reforms into a treaty and it would have to be done at a later stage.An early referendum would anger Eurosceptics who believe it would not allow enough time to make the case for exit or negotiate any meaningful concessions.""A rushed process would severely undermine the chances to secure a significant deal that both British business and voters could support and would waste the opportunity of a lifetime,"" Matthew Elliott, chief executive of Business for Britain told Breitbart London.The question is always crucial in any referendum and there is already a debate about what it should be. The Draft European Union (Referendum) Bill, published by the Conservatives in 2013, proposed this form of words: ""Do you think that the United Kingdom should remain a member of the European Union?""Some thought that leaned too far towards the status quo, encouraging a yes vote, and the Electoral Commission said it was not clear and direct enough. The watchdog proposed this form of words instead: ""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union?""The new Conservative government will attempt to repeal the Human Rights Act, which requires UK courts to treat the European Court of Human Rights as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. The European Court of Human Rights is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe (CoE), which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine.The freedom for people to move around Europe, enshrined in the EU treaties, works in parallel with the other three basic freedoms in the single market: freedom of goods, capital and services.It is likely to be a ""red line"" for other EU leaders, who do not want to see it eroded.Mr Cameron has steered clear of tackling it directly - for example by asking for an emergency ""brake"" on free movement, or a cap on numbers - focusing instead on reducing the incentive provided by welfare payments. In a speech last November, David Cameron set out measures to reduce the number of EU nationals moving to the UK.His main proposals were:Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission, has said he is ready to work with Mr Cameron to ""strike a fair deal for the United Kingdom in the EU"". The leaders of other EU nations have previously warned they are unlikely to support major changes to EU treaties to accommodate British demands. But Mr Cameron's general election victory may have given him extra leverage. ""The ball is very much in the court of the UK now,"" a senior EU official told The Guardian. ""It's up to the British to define what they want."" The key figure will be German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is very keen to keep Britain in the EU but has so far been unwilling to make major concessions to enable that to happen. There are fears that a ""pick and mix"" approach to EU treaties would undermine EU cohesion.Mr Cameron has said there is ""no doubt"" his planned reforms will require changes to the treaties governing the European Union. But this would require the unanimous support of all EU members, and may not be possible within the deadline he has set of a referendum before the end of 2017. Any attempt to change EU laws on free movement would meet fierce resistance from some EU nations, particularly Eastern European states. Mr Juncker has said free movement is non-negotiable.Mr Cameron may find it difficult to get unanimous support for his proposals for a four-year waiting period for migrant workers claiming UK benefits. East European EU members would be likely to oppose this, on the grounds that it would discriminate against their citizens.  Attempts to secure opt-outs for the City are unlikely to go down well with other European leaders.However, there are precedents for EU treaty changes to accommodate some countries' specific concerns - for example, the protocol attached to the Lisbon Treaty for Ireland.Mr Cameron has faced repeated calls to say whether he would campaign for Britain's exit from the EU in the referendum if he fails to get what he wants from the renegotiation process. All he has said is that he will ""rule nothing out"". Some Conservative MPs want Britain to leave the EU no matter what David Cameron manages to renegotiate. A larger group are likely to want more concessions than Mr Cameron has so far indicated he is prepared to demand.Senior backbencher David Davis, who was defeated by Mr Cameron for the Tory leadership in 2005, told the Daily Telegraph the majority of the 332 Conservative MPs want Mr Cameron to negotiate an ""opt-out"" power to stop individual EU laws from applying to Britain. The prime minister has said this would be ""impossible"" without Britain leaving the EU.Mr Davis claims as many as 60 Tory MPs would be prepared to rebel and vote for Britain's exit from the EU if the prime minister fails to deliver.Graham Brady, chairman of the Tory backbench 1922 committee, which represents backbenchers, has urged David Cameron to give all Conservative MPs, including ministers, a free vote in the EU referendum.In January, Mr Cameron warned that serving cabinet ministers would have to quit the government if they wanted to campaign to leave the EU if he had secured the reforms to it he wants.In the 1975 referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Economic Community, as the EU was then called, Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson decided to suspend collective responsibility because his cabinet was split on the issue. Ministers were allowed to vote with their consciences and campaign against each other. The majority of them, including Mr Wilson, joined the Yes camp, but left-wingers, such as Tony Benn, played a leading role in the No campaign. The Yes campaign won easily with 67% of the vote."

Governing parties don't gain seats. Parties that have implemented painful cuts and are promising more certainly don't. Until that is the Conservative Party did - achieving what had seemed to be Mission Impossible - a Tory majority.""BBC Scotland correspondent James Cook: ""Is this the end of the union? That is the question many people will be asking after the party which has fought for Scottish independence for 80 years swept to victory. The answer from the jubilant Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon is a firm ""no"". She insists that her MPs will speak for all of Scotland, not just for the 45% who voted for the country to leave the United Kingdom last September. 'This changes nothing,' Norman Smith, assistant political editor: ""This has been an election which may have more profound consequences than almost any in living memory. ""We now face a generational decision about our future in Europe, with an EU referendum in two years time almost certain. There will also be serious questions about the future of the Union, following an SNP landslide that has turned Scotland into a virtual one-party state. David Cameron's victory also represents a colossal achievement.""James Landale, deputy political editor: ""After an extraordinary night, some brief conclusions: With a small majority or slight minority for David Cameron, Tory MPs will be much empowered. As such, Mr Cameron will need support from other parties to get business through. The PM will also need a better whips office to handle rebellions.""Laura Kuenssberg, chief correspondent, Newsnight: ""For Labour the story of their terrible night is rapidly turning into the search for a new leader. So who will that be? Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, is almost certain to run. Even before this election, both he and another almost inevitable candidate, Chuka Umunna, had raised eyebrows inside the party at the work they had put in, preparing the ground with members and the unions for potential bids.""Robert Peston, economics editor: ""Sterling is up (the most for seven years against the euro), share prices are up (especially bank shares like Lloyds and RBS, and energy shares such as Centrica), government bond prices are up.

2015-05-21,Man overboard,https://web.archive.org//web/20150524033726/http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-32830379,"Harold Wilson died 20 years ago, on 24 May 1995. He would have died many years before that, writes novelist Isabel Wolff, had her family not saved him from drowning. As a child I spent many family holidays on the Isles of Scilly, 28 miles off the Cornish coast. We'd spend our time walking, cycling and, best of all, rock-pooling.  But where we would normally expect to catch a few shrimps and the odd crab, there was one memorable year when we pulled the Leader of Her Majesty's Opposition out of the water.  It was 10 August 1973 and we were enjoying a bike ride around the largest island, St Mary's. I was with my parents, my elder brother Simon, 16, then a pupil at Rugby School, his best friend Robert, and my younger brother, Matthew, who was 10.  As we cycled along a path above an isolated bay, Matthew spotted an empty rubber dinghy racing out to the open sea. As we watched it speed towards the horizon we wondered whose it was and why it was loose.  Suddenly my father said that he thought he'd heard a cry. Sure enough, above the buffeting of the wind we could just make out a distressed male voice. My father cupped his hands and shouted: ""What is your trouble?""  ""I can't get into my boat,"" the voice answered. ""Fetch a dinghy!""  We pedalled down to the bay as fast as we could.  My father yelled: ""We'll get to you in a few minutes. Can you hold on?""  ""Yes - for a bit,"" came the faint reply. While Robert sped off to alert the Coastguard, Simon found a dinghy - but it had no oars. My father hurriedly looked around for a pair but then, further off, saw a wooden ""pram"" dinghy, its oars still in its rowlocks.  He and Simon carried this to the water's edge and, with Simon guiding him, my father rowed out towards a group of motor launches moored about 300 yards from the shore. While they did this my mother, Matthew and I waited on the beach, which was deserted except for a benign looking Labrador chained up by a fisherman's hut.  The dog's name tag said ""Paddy"" and Matthew and I stroked his ears while we anxiously waited for events to unfold.   Twenty minutes later we saw my father and Simon coming back. Hunched between them in the boat was a bedraggled looking, but familiar figure.  ""It's Harold Wilson,"" I said.  As my father rowed towards the quay, the Labour leader suddenly stood up, nearly swamping the boat. He then sat down again until it had docked, and Simon helped him onto dry land.  I vividly recall how shocked he looked. His shorts and shirt were drenched, his hair was plastered to his scalp, his teeth were chattering and his face was white.  He declined my father's offer of further help, including the loan of a bike to get back to his bungalow, but said that he was glad that we'd come along when we did.  My father jovially responded that it wasn't every day one pulled a former prime minister out of the water and that we were happy to have been able to help.  Satisfied that Wilson was all right, we left him with Paddy and cycled away.  As we ate our picnic lunch my father and Simon explained that Wilson had slipped into the sea while attempting to step from his rubber dinghy onto his motor launch.  The dinghy had shot away from him - the dinghy that we'd seen.  Unable to pull himself into the boat, Wilson had been left hanging on to the fender ropes for dear life. He'd told them that he'd been feeling sea-sick and that his arms felt ""numb"" and were ""giving out"".  Simon had stepped on to Wilson's boat and had then hauled the man on to the deck ""like a sack of potatoes"".  Dad then swore us all to secrecy - if the story got out it could ruin the opposition leader's holiday, and our own.  The next morning we went down to Porthcressa and by chance we saw Wilson coming off the beach.   I remember thinking that he'd be happy to see us again - perhaps he'd even ask us to tea? To my surprise I saw a flash of irritation cross his face.   My father greeted him and asked how he was.  He replied that he felt all right, if rather stiff, and that he had spent the rest of the day in bed.  ""I've had my swim for the holiday though,"" he added pleasantly, then he went on his way and we didn't see him again.  Returning home after the holiday we told no-one what had happened but somehow, a month later, the story got out.  First my father was approached by our local paper which made the story a splash: ""Rugby Family Rescues Mr. Wilson From Sea."" This got picked up by the Birmingham Post and within 48 hours my father's face was on the front of every national newspaper.  Headlines such as ""Wilson Snatched From Drowning"" and ""Wilson Rescued in Sea Drama"" amused us, but we were outraged by the Daily Mirror's ""My Dog Tipped me In!""  In a piece of Labour spin, Wilson's press secretary, Joe Haines, had apparently blamed the labrador.  There was even a photo of ""the culprit"", Paddy, who was ""in the doghouse"".  One could see the need for damage limitation - the incident was extremely embarrassing for Wilson, not least because the Prime Minister Ted Heath was a world-class yachtsman. There were cartoons of Heath grinning at the news on board his yacht, Morning Cloud.  My father, a nuclear engineer, was besieged at work by TV film crews and quizzed about his voting habits. ""Lifelong Tory Saves Wilson from Drowning"", announced the Daily Telegraph.  The Times pointed out that the Labour Leader, whose party had pledged to end private education, had been rescued by a public schoolboy.  And so it went on. We put up with myriad jokes of the ""Why didn't you throw him back?"" variety.  In the meantime Haines continued to elaborate on the story.  Wilson, he claimed in the Mirror, was in ""no danger"".  He ""could have swum to the beach"" but was ""waiting for a friend"".  The truth is, Harold Wilson would have died.  Aged 57, he'd been in the cold water, never more than 15C on Scilly, for more than half an hour.  Knowing the strong Atlantic currents, he hadn't dared risk the long swim back to the beach.  Worst of all, in that deserted spot, there had been no-one to hear his cries.   Reflecting on the incident afterwards, my father told us that Wilson seemed not to understand that it was ""only by the slenderest margins"" that his life had been saved.  Six months later, in February 1974, Harold Wilson became prime minister again.It's now 42 years since ""The Wilson Affair"" as my family always called it.  It seems strange that despite all the publicity this very significant event in the life of Wilson is almost unknown.  Neither of his official biographers, Ben Pimlott and Philip Ziegler, mentioned it in their respective books, nor did Joe Haines revisit it in his own memoir of Wilson, Glimmers of Twilight.  I sometimes wondered how Wilson's colleagues had viewed the story at the time. Were they sympathetic? Amused?  Did they pull his leg about it?  ""Oh I remember it well,"" Denis Healey told me when I phoned him in the House of Lords a few months ago. ""Harold seemed very embarrassed by it and was clearly anxious to play the whole thing down.  We didn't feel that we could mention it to him - definitely not.""  And if my family hadn't happened to pass by when we did?  It's fair to say that the course of British politics might have been rather different.  Denis Healey or Jim Callaghan might have succeeded Wilson. Edward Heath might not have been defeated in 1974 and there might well have been no Tory leadership challenge the following year and therefore, quite possibly, no Thatcher premiership.  My late brother, Simon, used to wonder whether our father may, on that fateful August day, have inadvertently launched Margaret  Thatcher's prime ministerial career.

2015-05-21,Out or in?,https://web.archive.org//web/20150524033726/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32793642,"David Cameron has promised a referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Union by the end of 2017. Here is a summary of the key arguments for and against British membership.If Britain votes to leave the EU, it will have to negotiate a new trading relationship with what would now be a 27 member organisation, to allow British firms to sell goods and services to EU countries without being hit by excessive tariffs and other restrictions.Better off out: Britain could negotiate an ""amicable divorce"", but retain strong trading links with EU nations, say those campaigning for Britain's exit. There are several potential scenarios:Better off in: An ""amicable divorce"" is a pipe dream, pro-EU campaigners argue. France, Germany and other leading EU nations would never allow Britain a ""pick and mix"" approach to the bloc's rules. Norway and Switzerland have to abide by many EU rules without any influence over how they are formed. Negotiating a comprehensive free trade agreement could take years and have an uncertain outcome. And if Britain went for a completely clean break with the EU its exports would be subject to tariffs and would still have to meet EU production standards, harming the competitiveness of British business.The run-up to the EU referendum is likely to be dominated by competing claims about how many millions of jobs will be lost or gained by Britain's exit. All such claims come with a health warning. Coming up with a precise figure is difficult as there is no way of knowing if threats by foreign companies to scale back their operations in the UK would come to pass or, indeed, how many jobs would be created by the reshaped economy that might emerge in the wake of an exit.Better off out: There would be a jobs boom as firms are freed from EU regulations and red tape, say those arguing for an exit, with small- and medium-sized companies who don't trade with the EU benefiting the most. In its recent paper, the EU Jobs Myth, the free market Institute for Economic Affairs seeks to debunk the claim that 3-4 million jobs would be lost if Britain left. ""Jobs are associated with trade, not membership of a political union, and there is little evidence to suggest that trade would substantially fall between British businesses and European consumers in the event the UK was outside the EU,"" it argues. ""The UK labour market is incredibly dynamic, and would adapt quickly to changed relationships with the EU.""Better off in: Millions of jobs would be lost as global manufacturers moved to lower-cost EU countries. Britain's large, foreign-owned car industry would be particularly at risk. ""The attractiveness of the UK as a place to invest and do automotive business is clearly underpinned by the UK's influential membership of the EU,"" said a KPMG report on the car industry last year. The financial services sector, which employs about 2.1 million people in the UK, also has concerns about a British exit. ""The success of the UK financial services industry is to a large extent built on EU Internal Market legislation. To abandon this for some untried, unknown and unpredictable alternative would carry very significant risks,"" said global law firm Clifford Chance in a report by think tank TheCityUK last year.Much would depend on the trade deals Britain managed to negotiate with the EU and rest of the world after its exit. The best-case scenario, according to think tank Open Europe, is that the UK would be better off by 1.6% of GDP a year by 2030. That is assuming the UK carried out widespread deregulation after its exit and managed to strike favourable trade deals. The think tank adds: ""A far more realistic range is between a 0.8% permanent loss to GDP in 2030 and a 0.6% permanent gain in GDP in 2030, in scenarios where Britain mixes policy approaches"".The Centre for Economic Performance, at the London School of Economics, says the worst-case scenario is a 6.3% to 9.5% reduction in GDP, ""a loss of a similar size to that resulting from the global financial crisis of 2008/09"". The best case, according to their analysis, is a loss of 2.2% of GDP.Better off out: Britain would regain full control of its borders. UKIP wants to see a work permit system introduced, so that EU nationals would face the same visa restrictions as those from outside the EU, which it says would reduce population growth from current levels of 298,000 a year to about 50,000. This would create job opportunities for British workers and boost wages, as well as easing pressure on schools, hospitals and other public services. Better off in: Britain might have to agree to allow free movement of EU migrants as the price of being allowed access to the free market. In any case, immigration from the rest of the EU has been good for Britain's economy. The UK's growth forecasts are based, in part, on continued high levels of net migration. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility says the economy relies on migrant labour and taxes paid by immigrants to keep funding public services.The UK's net contribution to the EU, taking into account the rebate, was £11.3bn in 2013. That is more than four times what it was in 2008. It is about the same amount as the UK government spends on transport every year.Better off out: The UK would save billions in membership fees, and end the ""hidden tariff"" paid by UK taxpayers when goods are exported to the EU, caused by red tape, waste, fraud and other factors. Better off in: The UK's contribution to the EU budget is a drop in the ocean compared with the benefits to business of being in the single market. Better off out: The EU is not as important to British trade as it used to be, and continuing turmoil in the eurozone will make it even less so. Even if Britain did not manage to negotiate a free trade deal with the EU it would not be as disastrous as EU-enthusiasts claim, argues economist Roger Bootle in his book The Trouble with Europe: ""It would place the UK in the same position as the US is currently in, along with India, China and Japan, all of which manage to export to the EU relatively easily."" The UK would be free to establish bilateral trade agreements with fast-growing export markets such as China, Singapore, Brazil, Russia and India through the World Trade Organisation. Better off in: The EU is the UK's main trading partner, worth more than £400bn a year, or 52% of the total trade in goods and services. Complete withdrawal from the EU would see trade barriers erected, with car exports to the EU, for example, facing a 15% tariff and imports a tariff of 10%.  ""The idea that the UK would be freer outside the EU is based on a series of misconceptions, that a medium-sized, open economy could hold sway in an increasingly fractured trading system dominated by the US, the EU and China; that the EU makes it harder for Britain to penetrate emerging markets; and that foreign capital would be more attracted to Britain's economy if it were no longer part of the single market,"" the pro-EU Centre for European Reform said in a recent report.Better off out: The UK would remain a key part of Nato and the UN Security Council and a nuclear power, with a powerful global voice in its own right. The Eurosceptic Bruges Group wants an end to the ""discredited"" principle that Britain acts as a transatlantic bridge between the US and Europe, saying the country should make self-reliance its guiding principle.Better off in: Stripped of influence in Brussels, Berlin and Paris, Britain would find itself increasingly ignored by Washington and sidelined on big transnational issues such as the environment, security and trade. America and other allies want Britain to remain in the EU. The UK risks becoming a maverick, isolated state if it leaves.Better off out: Britain would gain full control of its own borders, with migration in and out of the country regulated solely by British law. It would be more difficult for EU citizens to move to the UK, although those already living here are unlikely to be removed. Better off in: A lot would depend on what kind of deal was reached with the other EU nations. Britons may have to apply for visas to enter EU countries and those already living there may face integration rules, such as proving they can speak the language before gaining long-term residency rights. There would also be uncertainty for many EU workers now paying taxes in the UK - what benefits, if any, would they be entitled to?Better off out: The EU has limited power over tax, which is largely a matter for national governments. The exception is VAT, which has bands agreed at the EU level. Outside the EU, the UK would potentially have more flexibility.Better off in:  ""Tax avoidance and evasion will reach crippling levels as our economy becomes increasingly wholly owned by foreign multinationals that make tax avoidance in Britain central to their business strategy,"" argued the pro-European The Observer newspaper in an editorial.Better off out: It would be a major shot in the arm for British democracy as the Westminster parliament regained its sovereignty and reconnected with voters. The country would be free from the European Arrest Warrant and other law and order measures.Better off in: Britons benefit from EU employment laws and social protections, which would be stripped away. Withdrawal from the European Arrest Warrant could mean delays for the UK in extraditing suspects from other European countries; and the UK already has some opt-outs from EU labour law, including the Working Time Directive."
2015-05-21,Mark Mardell,https://web.archive.org//web/20150524033726/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32803419,"The UK's future direction for at least a generation hangs precariously on an uncertainty, balanced on the tip of the unknown.I am talking of course about the planned referendum on the EU.  The brilliant thing about referendums, and one of the features that makes them so irksome for politicians is their binary clarity - ""Yes"" or ""No"", ""In"" or ""Out"".This one will be like that, but it isn't at the moment. For now, the most important group of potential voters are the ""Maybes"".They are not unsure because they are hesitant Harrys and Harriets who haven't grasped the big issues.It is much more political than that.  Some big names are rallying around the banner of ""Maybe"".The Foreign Secretary Phillip Hammond is one of them, and perhaps the most important is the mop-headed mayhap Boris Johnson. Their eventual decision depends, they say, on what change in the relationship David Cameron manages to negotiate - and that may well depend on what they and others argue, in political cabinet, he should demand. This is unknown because it is as yet undecided. Indeed, I am fairly sure almost all Conservative MPs will be herded into the ""Maybe"" camp by a twitch of deferent loyalty on one flank, the cracking whip of strategic cunning on the other.Those who know with certainty in their own hearts they will vote ""No"" may feel they have to give the prime minister a chance, or appear grossly disloyal. This has the added advantage that having played the part of a loyalist waiting with open-jawed admiration for the prime minister to return home with a piece of paper, their eventual disappointment will pack more heft. At the end of the process, they can declare that, despite all their high expectations, the deal is not good enough, and the obdurate EU has left them with no choice but to campaign for an ""Out"".  Equally, those who are determined to stay in might as well drape themselves in temporary Euroscepticism and mutter about how hard it is for Mr Cameron to ""squeeze anything out of that lot"".  When Mr Cameron returns with a deal, however paltry,  they can proclaim it a master stroke that forces them into the ""Yes"" camp. Still, some will have a genuine bottom line.It is not clear if the prime minister himself is one of them.He has set out, in rather loose terms, his aims, in the Sunday Telegraph last March.The trouble with most of them is that success would be difficult to measure. We will legislate in the first session of the next Parliament for an in-out referendum to be held on Britain's membership of the EU before the end of 2017. We will negotiate a new settlement for Britain in the EU. And then we will ask the British people whether they want to stay in on this basis, or leave. We will protect our economy from any further integration of the Eurozone. The integration of the Eurozone has raised acute questions for non-Eurozone countries like the UK. We benefit from the single market and do not want to stand in the way of the Eurozone resolving its difficulties.But we will not let the integration of the Eurozone jeopardise the integrity of the single market or in any way disadvantage the UK.We want to see powers flowing away from Brussels, not to it. We want national parliaments to be able to work together to block unwanted European legislation. And we want an end to our commitment to an ""ever closer union"", as enshrined in the treaty to which every EU country has to sign up.What sort of change would ensure ""businesses liberated from red tape"" or ""powers flowing away from Brussels""? Words alone would not suffice for those who think such changes are vital if the UK is to stay in the EU - after all, the European Commission would say it backs both. ""Free movement to take up work, not free benefits"" is more concrete and eminently achievable but may not look like the ""fundamental"" change in relationship that is promised. But ""new mechanisms in place to prevent vast migrations across the Continent"" looks much easier to declare as a ""win"" or ""lose"".After persistent warnings, particularly from German Chancellor Angela Merkel, that ""free movement of people"" was not up for grabs, the prime minister appeared to drop the idea. But he told the House of Commons only two months ago: ""In the coming two years, we have the opportunity to reform the EU and fundamentally change Britain's relationship with it. ""We have the opportunity to build a European Union that is more competitive, more flexible and more accountable to the people, where powers flow back to member states, not just away from them, and where freedom of movement is no longer an unqualified right.""How much would the EU have to qualify that right, to persuade the doubters?Would a promise to stop putative Serbians coming to Britain after their country joins, in perhaps 2030, do the trick? Again, that is unknown and uncertain.At the moment, most backbenchers are keeping their heads down and powder dry. But Jacob Rees Mogg, MP for North East Somerset and member of the European Scrutiny Committee in the last Parliament, told me: ""I think the touchstone for renegotiation will be the free movement of people. ""It is one of the four freedoms of the European Union, and if the EU is  willing to give ground on that it will show that it is willing to consider a fundamental reform rather than just tinkering at the edges. ""So it is symbolically important as well as representing a deep concern of the British people.""This is admirable in its clarity, and I suspect it will be a  touchstone too for many of his colleagues. Others may set the bar higher or lower, but one new MP told me: ""I wouldn't like to be in the prime minister's shoes.""He knows it has to be real - he can't just come back with a bit of polish on it."" The prime minister's challenge is to come back with a deal so bright and sunny that the snows of uncertainty melt away to reveal the sunny uplands of victory. Is that likely? Maybe."
2015-05-21,Peer problems?,https://web.archive.org//web/20150524033726/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32725118,"When David Cameron heads to the House of Lords for the Queen's Speech later this month he might want to cast his eye along the red benches. Sitting there will be scores of peers who - when the ermine robes are off and Parliament gets back to business - could start causing a bit of trouble for the government.Managing Mr Cameron's small majority in the Commons - 12 MPs - is going to require some skill from the party whips. But it could turn out to be an easy day at the office compared with handling the complicated mechanics of the Lords where the Conservatives aren't even close to a majority.The numbers - see below - don't add up for the prime minister in the ""upper chamber"".Together, Labour and the Lib Dems have 315 peers - enough to beat the Conservatives by 91 votes. Then there are the crossbench - or independent - peers to think about.  They're hard to predict as they don't vote as a block.  In the worst-case scenario for the Conservatives, their 224 peers are up against a whopping 555 from other parties and groups. On the other hand the crossbenchers could, in theory, help the Conservatives win.  As Professor Meg Russell, Director of the Constitution Unit at University College London, notes: ""The Conservatives are in a relatively weak position in the Lords, holding less than a third of seats. The government can readily be defeated by various combinations of other forces.""Policies that could stir up objections in the Lords include abolishing the Human Rights Act and legislation paving the way for an EU referendum. It's very unusual for peers to vote against an entire Bill. Their style is to go through legislation amending bits they don't like. The government can either accept the changes or overturn them in the Commons. Maybe David Cameron will start wishing he'd pushed on with plans, three years ago, to introduce elected peers. He abandoned the proposals in the face of opposition from Conservative MPs and peers. It was another reprieve for the House of Lords, which has survived numerous attempts at reform over the last 100 years.And there won't be another existential crisis for the time being. The Conservative election manifesto states that they see a ""strong case"" for introducing an ""elected element"" but ""it isn't a priority in the next Parliament"".With wounds to lick and new leaders to choose, Lib Dem and Labour strategists aren't thinking too deeply about their tactics in the  Lords. But as politicians drift back to Westminster the possibilities are starting to bleep on the political radar.Labour peer Lord Foulkes has already been tweeting about what he calls the ""difficult job"" facing the Leader of the Lords, Baroness Stowell, whose task is to get government business through.He predicts ""interesting times"", saying: ""Labour and the Liberal Democrats have a huge majority over the Conservatives. The crossbenchers are unpredictable but on a number of occasions they have come with us. The Lib Dems in the Lords are old-fashioned Lib Dems. They'll be happier working with us than the Tories.""The Liberal Democrats are leading lights in the campaign to turn the House of Lords into an elected chamber. It's a cruel irony that with only eight MPs, the Lib Dems will be relying on an institution they dislike to give them a solid platform at Westminster.How will they get along with their former coalition partners though? The Lib Dem peer, Baroness Hussein-Ece, said the Conservatives were now ""off the leash"" but wouldn't be getting ""an easy ride"".""The dynamics are going to be completely different. We will take things on a policy-by-policy basis. I feel quite passionately about keeping the Human Rights Act and I'm pretty sure that my colleagues will be opposing abolition vociferousIy.""But David Cameron can take some comfort from the fact that the Lib Dems will not be falling into Labour's arms. Baroness Hussein-Ece is certain there will be issues the two parties can agree on but is equally sure they will not form a happy union as a matter of course. She said: ""I'm afraid that the Labour Party is more interested in tribal politics. It could have conducted itself in a more progressive way during the election."" In the last Parliament, the coalition government was defeated 103 times in the Lords and a Labour source in the Lords predicts that the Conservatives will ""want to make up for lost time"". He said: ""What we anticipate is that they will start to look back at the concessions they made and the opposition amendments that got through.""And the feeling is that the government will find ways to use secondary legislation - which empowers ministers to adjust some laws.By convention, the House of Lords is reluctant to challenge policies promised in election manifestos and doesn't vote against measures on taxation and spending. But Professor Russell thinks the rules around those conventions are ""far from clear"" and that Labour and the Lib Dems might be tempted to block what they see as Conservative ""austerity"" measures. Meg Russell says: ""The House of Lords is a complicated place. Historically at least, they have always been very sensitive to public opinion. They are not likely to go in all guns blazing.""How can David Cameron deal with trouble in the Lords - even if it is well-meaning and principled?He can't get rid of any peers but he could, in theory, create a huge number of new Conservative peers to give him a stronger base. ""There are no rules,"" Meg Russell adds of the possibility. ""The prime minister has complete patronage. But of course it wouldn't go down well with the  public and there would be an outcry in Parliament.""And introducing too many new peers would also be embarrassing because the Conservatives have promised to tackle the size of the chamber. With 779 active members, it's one of the largest in the world.The Conservative Lord Cormack thinks that the prime minister shouldn't worry too much because he can rely on the Lords to behave ""with a considerable degree of sense"".""There will be stormy patches and it's always over the things that you don't predict,"" he says. ""But the important thing to do is play to the strengths of the Lords. There's an enormous accumulation of wisdom and experience. It generally improves bills."" He is relaxed about the next few years. ""I don't anticipate any unpleasantness. For the government to be defeated in the House of Lords isn't the end of the world."" And that's because, he said, the Lords believes in the supremacy of the Commons.It may be a while before the new dynamics in the Lords play out. The first bills will be unveiled in the Queen's Speech on 27th May and any controversial ones may not reach the House of Lords until after the summer break.But there's one other constitutional niggle to mention. In theory, all parties should be represented in the House of Lords - even the small ones. The Greens have one peer and UKIP has three. But there are no members of the SNP in the House of Lords. And with 56 MPs, it means the Lords isn't speaking for millions of people in Scotland. The SNP is adamant, though, that it doesn't want anything to do with the place.With the Lords potentially a powerful force, are the Scottish Nationalists missing a trick?Not according to the SNP MP Pete Wishart who declared: ""It's an affront to democracy. We will have nothing to do with this democratic outrage. The House of Lords doesn't need reform. We need to abolish it and start again."""
2015-05-21,Olive branches or burning bridges?,https://web.archive.org//web/20150524033726/http://www.bbc.com/news/education-32796618,"When Nicky Morgan became education secretary last year her biggest strength and biggest problem were the same thing - not being Michael Gove.Her predecessor had cast a long shadow, having dominated the education landscape and in many ways re-made it in his own likeness.Mrs Morgan was introduced as a less confrontational figure, offering an olive branch to a teaching profession that had felt that it was being used for target practice.But many of the questions she faced were about how she defined herself against the Gove legacy, rather than about her own vision.Now she is back under her own steam, authority enhanced and able to stamp her own identity on the Department for Education.So what will be the direction of schools in England under Mrs Morgan? Will it be more olive branches? Or will it be more burning bridges?The first education bill of the new Parliament promises to create hundreds of academies and free schools, with plans to replace the leadership of schools that are struggling. So no surprises there, it's going to be more of the same.And it will raise the same questions about whether structural change really raises standards.But so much of this debate is about the rhetoric rather than the reality - and head teachers have been bristling at the language of threats to send in teams of new leaders to ""failing and coasting schools"".Heads' leaders have been irritated that the public discourse is already so negative.And they ask where are all these armies of superstar replacement heads waiting to be ""parachuted"" into schools?The ""coasting school"" motif really irritates them, not least because it's such a vague term, leaving many heads unsure whether they should be looking over their shoulder.But maybe they should see it as part of the cycle of government.""Hundreds of schools in England which are considered to be 'coasting' are facing a government crackdown."" This was a story from 2007, with an almost identical threat of such lacklustre schools being taken over.And it wasn't even new then. ""The school standards watchdog in England is to crack down on 'coasting' schools"". That was from 1999 - and it annoyed head teachers then too.It's also worth noting that Ofsted at the same time announced that schools would only receive from six to 10 working weeks' notice of an inspection, instead of two terms. It's now less than one day's notice.And schools are still ""coasting"".One of the balancing acts for Mrs Morgan will be how to keep school leaders on board, as serious professional partners, when at the same time the political language about education often reverts into accusations and threats.Heads say they are facing big practical pressures in the next five years - hundreds of thousands of extra pupils needing places, fears of a shortage of teachers and head teachers, and worries about over-stretched budgets.Constantly talking about academies seems an ideological sideshow to them.And the engagement of heads will be crucial in what is going to be a major task for the next five years - rolling out the curriculum and qualifications reforms announced under the previous coalition government. There are bound to be some unforeseen bumps, and downright craters, in this delivery phase.Mrs Morgan has promised that the next five years will see an end to ""constant change"". There was a strong message to teachers during the election campaign that there would be more bedding in and less uprooting.And that means finding a way to avoid any more headline-grabbing changes, without looking like this is an administration that is becalmed. She'll have to show that less is more.But there are still questions to be decided which will be seen as symbolic. Not least about whether to allow a Kent grammar school to open a satellite branch in another town.Speaking privately, heads' leaders say there seems to be a balancing act.Mrs Morgan is described as being much more accessible and wanting a better relationship with the teaching profession - and the atmosphere in the Department for Education is described as ""completely different"" than in the Gove era.They describe ministers as being ""very upbeat"".But head teachers still bridle at what seems to be a very different political tone, that they criticise as negative towards schools, lacking in evidence and counter-productive.Good cop, bad cop? Mrs Morgan now has the chance to establish her own classroom style."
2015-05-21,New-look Commons,https://web.archive.org//web/20150524033726/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32795139,"MPs are back at Westminster to be sworn in as the new Parliament gets under way. But what's new this time around? Here are some things to look out for:Television viewers will get a new perspective on our politicians, thanks to eye-level cameras in the Commons. Approved by the House of Commons Commission in February, the cameras offer an alternative to the traditional high-level fixed positions to which viewers have become accustomed over the years. It comes after TV cameras were allowed into previously forbidden parts of the Palace of Westminster for the BBC's Inside the Commons documentary.The number of women in Parliament has risen by about a third to 191. Female MPs now make up 29% of the overall total. The proportion of female Conservative and Labour MPs has increased, despite an overall fall in the number of Labour MPs. But the biggest rise in female representation in the Commons came from the Scottish National Party, which now has 20 female MPs, up from just one.Labour MP Sir Gerald Kaufman is the new Father of the House, the title given to the MP with the longest continuous service who is not a minister.The member for Manchester Gorton replaces Conservative Sir Peter Tapsell, who stood down as MP at the election. His main duty, as demonstrated on Monday, is to preside over the election of a new Speaker.First elected in 1970, Sir Gerald pips three other MPs - Conservatives Ken Clarke and Michael Meacher, and Dennis Skinner of Labour, who all entered Parliament on the same day - because he swore the oath before them.Labour's acting leader Harriet Harman appointed herself to the unofficial title after pointing out she was the longest-serving female MP in the Commons. The MP for Camberwell and Peckham, first elected in 1982, made the comments during the Speaker's election exchanges, ""to prevent us all from falling headlong into patriarchy"" and promised ""good parenting"" along with Mr Kaufman.At 20 years of age, the SNP's Mhairi Black is the UK's youngest elected MP since 1667.The MP for Paisley and Renfrewshire South, who ousted shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander, found herself surrounded by Labour MPs on the green benches during the Speaker election. The politics student - who worked part-time in a chip shop before winning her seat - has been studying for her final exams in the House of Commons of Library, she revealed in an ITV interview.The influx of SNP MPs has led to some competition on the Labour benches. This was illustrated during the Speaker election as Labour MPs found themselves displaced from their familiar spots when the nationalists arrived early to bag their places. But Labour veteran Dennis Skinner held on to his traditional seat on the front corner of the far opposition bench. The Bolsover MP was spotted wedged in next to the SNP's Chris Law. ""I only had half a cheek on, but I was there before them and I will be there when they are gone,"" he told the Mirror. There are said to be just 427 seats available for MPs, and backbenchers use their prayer cards to guarantee a spot.The Liberal Democrats have been hardest hit by the new seating arrangements, with their eight MPs positioned in a distant corner of the opposition benches. It's a far cry from the days of coalition, when the likes of Nick Clegg and Danny Alexander regularly fielded questions from the despatch box.Aside from the prospect of a new Labour leader grilling Prime Minister David Cameron, the SNP will also get two questions in the weekly Parliamentary showpiece because of its third party status. Moray MP Angus Robertson, the party's Westminster leader, will get the role previously filled by the Liberal Democrats before the coalition government.The new House of Commons is more ethnically diverse than ever, with 41 non-white MPs, up from 27. And for the first time, there is an MP of Chinese origin - Alan Mak, who represents Havant for the Conservatives.Stephen Kinnock, son of former Labour leader Neil, is now an MP for the party. So is Rupa Huq, the sister of former Blue Peter presenter Konnie Huq, and Tulip Siddiq, whose aunt, Sheikh Hasina, is the prime minister of Bangladesh.The new House has 32 gay, lesbian and bisexual MPs - more than in any Parliament in any other country. According to an analysis for the New Statesman, 13 of these are Labour, and 12 are Conservative.For the first time since 1885, there are no former prime ministers anywhere in Parliament. Labour's Gordon Brown stood down at the general election, and neither of his two predecessors, Tony Blair and John Major, took seats in the House of Lords.The elections aren't over in the House of Commons, where chairmen and women have to be voted in to lead most of the Commons select committees.The committees, covering subjects like home affairs, health and transport, have an increasingly high-profile role in holding the government to account, carrying out inquiries, taking evidence from witnesses and publishing reports. Some committees, like foreign affairs and culture, media and sport, are guaranteed a new name in charge because the former holder has left Parliament or been promoted to the government.One thing that hasn't changed, to some people's surprise, is the occupant of the Speaker's chair. John Bercow was re-elected unopposed when MPs returned after the election, despite efforts by the Conservatives to make it easier for him to be unseated at the very end of the last Parliament. Meanwhile, there will be at least one new deputy Speaker - Labour MP Dawn Primarolo stood down, and elections will be held for each of the deputy posts in the coming weeks."

2015-05-22,PM announces freeze in ministers' pay,https://web.archive.org//web/20150524033726/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32863296,"Government ministers' pay will remain frozen for the next five years, David Cameron has announcedWriting in the Sunday Times, the prime minister said we were ""all in this together"" when it came to paying off the national debt.His pledge will save about £800,000 a year and £4m by 2020.The decision means ministerial pay will not have risen for a decade by the end of parliament. Cabinet ministers currently receive a salary of £134,565.This includes their pay as MPs. The prime minister is paid a total of £142,500.Mr Cameron said his decision to freeze ministerial pay for the duration of the parliament was part of his ""One Nation"" approach to tackling the deficit, and becoming a country where ""all hard-working people can get on"".He writes: ""We can't pretend there's not still a long way to go. We've halved the deficit as a share of the economy - but there's still half of it left to pay off.""So we will continue to take the difficult decisions necessary to bring spending down and secure our economy. As we go about doing that, I want people to be in no doubt: I said five years ago we were all in this together, and five years on, nothing has changed.""That's why, for example, I've decided to freeze the pay of the ministers in the government. For me, that's just one step which sends out a clear signal: that as we continue knuckling down as a country, we will all play our part.""Meanwhile, the UK's 650 MPs - who are currently paid £67,060 - are in line for a 9% pay rise later this year after the independent watchdog - known as the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA) -  said pay should rise to £74,000 after the election.Changes brought in after the 2009 expenses scandal mean MPs are no longer in charge of setting their own pay rates, instead this issue now falls within the purview of IPSA.But the government has made it clear that the scale of the IPSA's suggested increase is ""not right"" and should be reconsidered, given that public sector pay rises have been capped at 1%.Is this a surprise? No. Will it save much money? No. Is it symbolically important to the point that it would have been more newsworthy if they'd not done this? Absolutely. The prime minister acknowledges that there are ""difficult decisions"" to come, so this is important symbolically to try to prove, as he puts it, that ""we are all in this together."" What is likely to prove much more tricky is the expected big rise coming soon in the basic pay all MPs receive.After the expenses scandal, parliament decided MPs' pay should be set by an independent body. But always beware the law of unintended consequences: that body could now recommend, against the vociferous protests of the party leaders, a big hike in their pay packets.MPs are also not paid extra for their committee work, although committee chairs get a £14,000 supplement, taking their pay to £81,642.Ahead of Wednesday's Queen's Speech setting out his priorities for the first year of his new term, Mr Cameron used his newspaper column to insist that his new administration would be ""about so much more than balancing the books"".""As we return to office, after five years of a long-term economic plan and sacrifices by the British people, we're on the brink of something different - something special,"" he writes.""We can become a country where all hard-working people can get on; not a two-speed society where some can afford childcare and homes of their own and others cannot.""We can become a country where all children get the education they deserve and no-one settles for a life on benefits; so no-one's background is a barrier to their success.""In other words, we can become One Nation."""

He said the prime minister started with some credit because of his election victory.""[David Cameron] won an election in a reasonably brilliant way as a politician, as a professional of politics he did a good job and these guys are in the same job and they recognise that"", he said.""There are issues of substance, but the psychology of that matters very much.""  He warned there would be some red lines, such as free movement of people but there was a ""margin of manoeuvre"" over this and exempting the UK from ""ever closer union"". He suggested Mr Cameron's tone would be important.""Most European leaders, including myself, feel David Cameron needs to be able to make a good case for Europe in the referendum.""They need to help them but he himself must make a pro-EU case in the UK, which frankly hasn't been done for the last 15 years.""There has to be some change to the UK narrative, which will probably be the price for a compromise."" Mr Lamy said if Britain left, it would be bad news for the EU. He said in his previous jobs, he found world leaders, like the presidents of China and Brazil, felt the EU was founded on two miracles - peace between France and Germany, and British membership.""Half of the miracle would evaporate if the Brits were to leave the European Union,"" he added.On Friday, the prime minister admitted he has not found himself surrounded by a ""wall of love"", as he put it - but he will find Europe's leaders are willing to help him construct a ladder to hop over the high fence he has built for himself.Labour's Harriet Harman has also said her party would now support David Cameron's planned referendum bill, clearing a path for a ballot by the end of 2017.Writing in the Sunday Times, Ms Harman said: ""We have now had a general election and reflected on the conversations we had on doorsteps throughout the country. The British people want to have a say on the UK's membership of the European Union. ""Labour will therefore now support the EU referendum bill when it comes before the House of Commons.""But she added that although her party was no longer opposing a referendum, Labour would still be campaigning for the UK to remain part of the union.As a high profile, fervent believer in European integration Mr Pascal's words are important - and suggest the European establishment want to give Mr Cameron a deal that will help him win a referendum.If Mr Cameron failed it would inflict a grave, potentially fatal, wound on a project already under assault from numerous directions. They will have their own red lines of course, but Mr Cameron's biggest problem may well come at home. He faces Goldilocks' porridge problem - what is suitable to sup for European leaders may prove too tepid for backbenchers. What is the right temperature for them, is likely to burn lips on the continent. Seeking a deal that is ""just right"" will not be easy.David Cameron is ready to start renegotiating the terms of Britain's EU membership ahead of a referendum.

In that time he learned his brief, gained the ­experience, handled the media and won the public's trust with an overwhelming landslide.""I have seen a lot of those skills and ­qualities in Andy Burnham during his 13 years as an MP.""Many people talk about aspiration but Andy is a living example - a working-class lad from Liverpool who went to a ­comprehensive and got a place at Cambridge University.

2015-05-22,Apprenticeship system 'fails young',https://web.archive.org//web/20150524033726/http://www.bbc.com/news/education-32844164,"The apprenticeship system in Britain is ""failing"" and needs reform to address youth unemployment, a new report says. The study, commissioned by the Local Government Association, found 42% of all apprenticeships created in the last five years went to people aged over 25.It said current policy enabled businesses to train established workers rather than unemployed young people.The government said the number of young people not in work, education or training was at its lowest in a decade.It has pledged to create a further three million apprenticeships before the end of Parliament in 2020.   The report, by the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) and the Local Government Association (LGA), found 67% of intermediate-skilled apprentices were already employed by their company when they were given their apprenticeships. The study also said demand for apprenticeships - particularly among young people - had soared, with one million people applying for 85,000 vacancies last year.This was despite two million apprenticeships starting over the last Parliament, the report said. In 2013-14 under-19s applied for 57% of the advertised apprenticeships but were given 27% of them, whereas over-25s made up 7% of applications but filled 37% of the vacancies. The study's authors said the government needed to undertake ""significant reform"" of the apprenticeship system, which they said was ""failing to get to grips with stubbornly high levels of youth unemployment"".Luke Raikes, research fellow at IPPR North, said: ""A high quality apprenticeship system could be used to combat youth unemployment and drive higher productivity, but the system we currently have is failing to deliver.""There is a big gap between the function apprenticeships should have in our economy and how they're being used in practice: the majority of apprenticeships are being used to train older people, and those who are already employed at their company, instead of taking on young people out of work.""Just over a third of apprenticeships created in the last five years were at advanced or higher level, with the majority of places being at the intermediate level.And 24% of 16-18 year olds, and 15% of all intermediate apprentices were not being paid the minimum wage, the report said. Pay was particularly low in hairdressing and childcare, where 42% and 26% of apprentices were paid less than the minimum wage. The report said local apprenticeship hubs should be created and given full control of the apprenticeship grant from central government. This would enable employers to tailor the apprenticeship offer to better meet the needs of local employers and the local economy, it said.Powers and budgets for apprenticeships should also be further devolved to local authorities.   Cllr Peter Box, economy spokesman for the LGA, said: ""A good apprenticeship can give young people the experience, skills and understanding that can often lead straight into a full-time job. ""At present, too many new apprenticeships are low skilled and taken by older people already in work with their employer."""
2015-05-22,Email error reveals bank's EU project,https://web.archive.org//web/20150524033726/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32856698,"The Bank of England has confirmed it is researching the financial risks of the UK leaving the EU after it ""inadvertently"" sent details of its work to a national newspaper.A senior official sent an email about its confidential project on the issue to an editor at the Guardian newspaper.A spokesman for the bank described the error as ""unfortunate"".Prime Minister David Cameron has promised an in/out referendum on the UK's EU membership by the end of 2017.Labour's shadow chancellor Chris Leslie called for ""a full and informed debate, not clandestine processes shrouded from public view"".The email indicates a small group of senior staff are to examine the economic effects of the UK leaving the EU under the authority of Sir Jon Cunliffe, who is the deputy director for financial stability, the Guardian says.The email also spells out that should anyone ask about the project - codenamed Project Bookend - the taskforce should say it concerns ""a broad range of European economic issues"", and not make any reference to the forthcoming referendum.By BBC business correspondent Joe LynamImagine the outrage if - the morning after Britain had voted to quit the EU - the Bank of England put out a statement saying: ""We start work today on how 'Brexit' might affect the markets and UK firms.""  First of all we'd ask why do we pay these people to react rather than pre-empt massive outcomes. Secondly it might have already been too late.  There might have been a huge sell-off in sterling. Government bonds - known as gilts - might have plunged in value, meaning the cost of borrowing for the Treasury might have soared overnight.Britain's major listed companies might have seen billions wiped off their value in early trading.Of course none of that might happen. Markets might have been very sanguine about quitting the EU. But we don't know and the only way the Bank of England would know was if it did some quiet preparatory work - outside the glare of publicity.That latter hope is now forlorn.The email, from Sir Jon Cunliffe's private secretary to four senior executives, was written on 21 May, the Guardian reported.James Talbot, the head of the monetary assessment and strategy division, was also involved in Project Bookend, the paper said.The email is quoted as saying: ""Jon's proposal, which he has asked me to highlight to you, is that no email is sent to James's team or more broadly around the Bank about the project.""James can tell his team that he is working on a short-term project on European economics in International [division] which will last a couple of months. This will be in-depth work on a broad range of European economic issues. Ideally he would then say no more.""The memo goes on to propose that questions from ""other parties"" about ""whether this was a project to look at the referendum"", should be given the answer, ""that there is a lot going on in Europe in the next couple of months - pointing to some of the specific European economic issues (eg: Greece) that would be of concern to the Bank"".A statement from the bank said: ""Today, information related to planned confidential Bank work on the potential implications of a renegotiation and national referendum on the UK's membership of the European Union made its way into the public domain, due to an internal email sent inadvertently to an external party.""There are a range of economic and financial issues that arise in the context of the renegotiation and national referendum.  It is one of the Bank's responsibilities to assess those that relate to its objectives.""It is not sensible to talk about this work publicly, in advance. But as with work done prior to the Scottish referendum, we will disclose the details of such work at the appropriate time.""While it is unfortunate that this information has entered the public domain in this way, the Bank will maintain this approach.""David Cameron is ready to start renegotiating the terms of Britain's EU membership ahead of a referendum.

Conservative former Cabinet minister Owen Paterson, a prominent eurosceptic, said the Bank's project should include the option of remaining in the European Economic Area without being a member of the EU.""If the Bank does look at those very optimistic options, that is thoroughly worthwhile and I hope they will make those investigations public,"" he told the Today programme.""It isn't either 'remain in the European Union or leap into the darkness'; there are other options,"" he added.BBC business correspondent Joe Lynam said the Bank of England would have kept the project secret to avoid becoming a political ""actor"" in the referendum.The bank had appeared to be ""slightly dragged into"" the debate ahead of the referendum on Scottish independence, he said.He added that there was no evidence that talk on Twitter of it being a deliberate leak was accurate.On Friday Mr Cameron met European counterparts for the first time since his general election victory, and admitted he was ""not met with a wall of love"" as he began diplomatic negotiations aimed at securing changes to the UK's relationship with Brussels.At a summit in Riga he conceded that securing a deal would take ""patience and tenacity"" and refused to ruled out campaigning for Britain to leave the EU if his renegotiation efforts failed."

That's more than half the Labour team at Holyrood. Many of them would like her elected unopposed. Yet when she announced her intention to stand, Ms Dugdale said she would ""absolutely"" welcome a contest. Ken MacIntosh is offering that challenge. He is likely to require the support of six or seven MSPs to become a candidate. But he claims his supporters are being ""bullied and intimidated"" by what he calls the ""party machine"" in an attempt to avoid a contest. He has not been more specific. There are certainly those who think a coronation would save time and political energy and allow Labour to concentrate on the 2016 Holyrood election campaign. Others argue that a contest would allow a fuller debate about Labour's problems and possible solutions and give the new leader more authority to pursue reform. Mr Macintosh said he would campaign on fairness and social justice across the whole of Scotland with an emphasis on lifelong learning, housing and renewable energy.""The reason I think it is important that I put my views forward is I think that is all about restoring trust in the Labour Party,"" he said. ""At the last election people could not bring themselves to put their trust in Labour. I can't believe that after all these years and what we stand for.""Mr Macintosh said restoring the Scottish Labour Party required integrity, principles and honesty and ""moving away from machine politics and guile and the idea it's about power and position"".""I'm in politics to make other people's lives better, whether I'm leader or not leader, whether I'm MSP or not MSP. I am a conviction politician,"" he said.He said problems with the ""party machine"" were about ""people who want power and position and influence"", which was an ""issue for all politicians"". ""We have to remember our principles and if we can't do that we can't restore confidence in the Labour Party,"" Mr Macintosh added.Former East Renfrewshire MP Mr Murphy announced that he would resign next month after Labour's crushing general election defeat at the hands of the SNP. Ms Dugdale, the Lothian region MSP, said she welcomed a leadership contest. She has won the backing of more than half of Scottish Labour's MSPs and MP Ian Murray since announcing her intention to stand on Friday. ""I am proud to have already won the support of so many Labour colleagues in the Scottish Parliament,"" Ms Dugdale said.""The geographical spread of support I have - with MSPs from north and south, east and west - as well as the backing of MSPs from different parts of our movement shows I can bring our party together."""
2015-05-22,Balls 'not dashing back to politics',https://web.archive.org//web/20150524033726/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32852568,"Ed Balls has told the BBC he will not be ""dashing back"" to frontline politics after losing his seat at the election.He said he had wanted Labour's campaign to be more ""pro-business"" but he had backed Ed Miliband ""100%"" and he shared responsibility for the party's defeat.""In the end he didn't persuade people he could be the prime minister but I didn't persuade people I could be the chancellor either,"" said Mr Balls.He was speaking exclusively to BBC political editor Nick Robinson.In his first interview since election night, the former shadow chancellor spoke of his ""sense of loss"" at Labour' defeat and described losing his seat two weeks ago as ""a symbol of the vibrancy of our democracy"".He said: ""I always knew if the Tories won a majority I was probably a goner, but the reason I travelled 7,500 miles and went to 45 seats was because I was fighting to win."" He added: ""Politics is a brutal business,"" because ""it was a real possibility"" his party might win, and he might become chancellor.Commenting on the campaign, he said: 'I think I wanted to be more pro-business but I also backed Ed Miliband 100%. ""He was the leader I was the shadow chancellor we both worked very hard and in the end neither he or I persuaded people and we need to take our responsibility for that. It's not all on him it's on all of us.""Were you up for that Ed Balls moment - the symbol of Labour's crushing electoral defeat, the trigger for wild Tory celebrations and Labour despair?Ed Balls was in reflective mood when we spoke - looking back at what he'd achieved as much as forward to what might be next.For the rest of Nick's article and a full transcript of the interview, click here.In one of the shock results of election night, the former shadow chancellor lost his Morley and Outwood seat in West Yorkshire by 422 votes to Conservative Andrea Jenkyns.He had previously had a majority of 1,101 in the constituency on the outskirts of Leeds.Asked by Nick Robinson if he was one of the reasons Labour was unelectable, Mr Balls replied: ""Of course. ""I mean Ed Miliband said straight after the election he took responsibility but all of us have to bear our share of responsibility. ""Ed was the leader I backed him as shadow chancellor 100%. In the end he didn't persuade people he could  be the prime minister but I didn't persuade people I could be the chancellor either. I have to take that on the chin. ""People will analyse for weeks and months what happened and that's something that still feels too early for me."" Speaking about his own future, Mr Balls said: ""I'm not going to be dashing back"" to frontline politics but ""never say never"". He was, he said, embarking on ""a new chapter, outside of politics. No by-elections, not back in parliament, that is how it feels at the moment. Outside of politics is where I am going next."" He says his wife Yvette Cooper, who is running to be Labour leader, is ""brilliant and people will get a chance to see what she stands for"" but he insisted that ""I am not playing a role in her campaign"" except ""whilst she is busy I can do more to help family"".  Asked whether whether he worries that she is applying for the toughest job in British politics he said: ""You have to take your calling when it comes."" Mr Balls did not rule out appearing on Strictly Come Dancing - a prospect his wife has described as ""truly terrifying"" - but he told Nick Robinson that despite running three marathons ""I'm not sure if I'm equipped for Strictly."" He said he'd be spending his time ""cooking, running, playing the piano"" and using ""real time to stand back and think"" to write about economics.  He reflected, finally, on his image - and how he was perceived by the electorate:  ""It is very hard in politics for people to see the real you. You are seen through the prism your opponents set up.""Mr Balls' demise spelled the end of a decade in Parliament which has seen him at the heart of the Labour machine.He held the position of chief economic adviser to the Treasury in the Blair government from 1997, working on policies including Sure Start, tax credits and the national minimum wage.Ed Balls first became an MP in 2005 and a year later was made Economic Secretary to the Treasury.He was a close adviser to then-chancellor Gordon Brown and earned a reputation as a political bruiser."
2015-05-22,Cameron 'confident' of EU success,https://web.archive.org//web/20150524033726/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32840696,"David Cameron has said he is confident he can get a better deal for the UK in Europe but admitted it ""won't be easy"". Speaking at an EU summit in Latvia, he said he had not been greeted ""by a wall of love"" when he met EU leaders for the first time since his election win.But he said he had a mandate and the ""British people at his back"" for the changes he wanted to achieve.The prime minister will hold talks with Angela Merkel and EU Commission boss Jean-Claude Juncker next week.Mr Cameron will also meet French President Francois Hollande as he tries to win support for his position.Other EU countries have said they will listen to what the UK has to say, the Finnish prime minister Alexander Stubb saying he backed the UK's proposals to cut red tape and was sure ""some kind of compromise"" could be reached. But some member states have questioned the need for any change to EU treaties, something Mr Cameron has said he wants to see, and ruled out any watering down of the key principle of freedom of movement. Speaking at a meeting of EU leaders, Mr Cameron said he believed it was in the interests of both the UK and its European partners for the UK to remain part of the European Union but under different terms.The British people, he said, were not happy with the status quo and wanted change on issues such as welfare, immigration and an opt-out from further integration.Mr Cameron said he had only begun to ""scratch the surface"" of the discussions but would travel to Berlin and Paris next week as well as hosting European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker at his country residence, Chequers, on Monday.He said the British people needed ""the best possible choice"" about the UK's future in Europe and did not rule out bringing forward his promised referendum, currently scheduled to take place by the end of 2017. Mr Cameron said he expected ""lots of ups and downs"" in the process and reminding journalists that many of their pre-election forecasts were wrong, he urged them to ""wait for the result"".""I do not expect to find agreed solutions straight away,"" he told them.""These talks will require patience and tenacity. But by working together in the right spirit and sticking at it, I believe we can reform the EU and our relationship with it. And then the British people will have the final say. They will decide.""The changes he was seeking were ""deliverable and doable"", he insisted.""I've set out a series of changes which I think address the main concerns that British people have, that I have, about Europe and the way it works. And I'm confident of getting those changes.""British officials said the process was at a very early stage, but the meetings with Mrs Merkel, regarded as Germany's most powerful leader and Mr Juncker, the most senior official in Brussels, will be seen as key to setting the tone for future discussions. Mr Cameron is committed to holding an in/out referendum on Britain's membership of the EU by the end of 2017, but there is speculation it could be held next year to avoid a clash with elections in France and Germany.Legislation paving the way for the UK referendum is expected to be published next Thursday, the day after the Queen opens Parliament.Asked whether he would be prepared to recommend a UK exit if he did not get the outcome he wanted, Mr Cameron said he would ""not rule anything out"". David Cameron is ready to start renegotiating the terms of Britain's EU membership ahead of a referendum. Here is some further reading on what it all means: The UK and the EU: Better off in or out?What Britain wants from EuropeQ&A: The UK's planned EU referendumTimeline: EU referendum debateWhy Germany is David Cameron's new best friendBBC deputy political editor James Landale said Mr Cameron had used the summit, arranged to discuss the EU's relationship with Russia and its neighbours, to sound out other European leaders about what they might be willing to accept before the start of ""intricate"" negotiations in the coming months.Other EU leaders, he added, were ""scared witless"" by the possibility of the UK leaving the EU and were willing to listen and consider a deal, but there were some things - such as changes to freedom of movement rules - which were ""sacrosanct"".Mr Cameron has not revealed the full details of what he is seeking from any changes, but he is expected to demand an opt-out from one its core principles of forging an ""ever-closer union"" between member states. He will also try to get more powers to block or opt out of new EU laws, and for restrictions on welfare benefits for migrants until they have lived in the UK for four years.This week, a number of UK business leaders started to highlight the potential implications of the referendum, with the president of the CBI saying businesses should ""speak out early"" in favour of remaining in a reformed EU,The Labour Party, SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems are in favour of staying in the EU. UKIP, which got almost four million votes but only one MP in the election, want to leave."

And who is vying for the deputy leader job?Shadow health minister Liz Kendall was the first Labour MP to say they wanted a crack at the party's top job, saying a ""fundamentally new approach"" was needed.First elected to Parliament in 2010 as MP for Leicester West and appointed to the shadow front bench the same year, Ms Kendall is seen as a Blairite contender.She is a former special adviser to Harriet Harman and then Health Secretary Patricia Hewitt who has argued for reform of public services.In an interview for The House magazine in January, she said there ""will remain a role"" for private and voluntary firms in the health service, ""where they can add extra capacity to the NHS or challenge to the system"".Could she be a fresh face to lead a change of direction for Labour, or seen as too inside the Westminster bubble?The Labour MP for Leigh since 2001, Andy Burnham has plenty of government experience and is the current bookies' favourite.Mr Burnham served as health secretary under Gordon Brown and previously as culture secretary and chief secretary to the Treasury.He stood for the leadership in 2010 but lost out to Ed Miliband, going on to hold the shadow health brief under Mr Miliband's leadership.

He said in a statement posted on his Twitter feed that had been uncomfortable with the level of ""sheer pressure"" and scrutiny that came with being a candidate.The 36-year-old added that it had perhaps been ""too soon"" for him to launch a leadership bid.Another rising star of the 2010 intake, the MP for Leeds West was appointed shadow chief secretary to the Treasury in 2011 and shadow work and pensions secretary in 2013.During the election campaign, she attacked the so-called bedroom tax, whereby housing benefit payments are reduced for tenants in council and social housing deemed to have spare rooms.However, she also suggested Labour would consider reducing the overall welfare cap in some areas.She told BBC News Labour needs ""to be in the centre ground to win a general election"" but ruled herself out of a leadership bid.A former home secretary and shadow chancellor, Alan Johnson is the Labour leadership candidate who never quite was.The popular MP declined to stand in 2010 and stepped down from his shadow cabinet role in 2011 for personal reasons.Earlier this year it was reported that senior New Labour figures Lord Mandelson and Alistair Campbell approached Mr Johnson over a leadership bid, although all three later distanced themselves from the story.But the former postman, who has been MP for Hull West and Hessle since 1997, had seemingly ruled himself out again, saying it is a ""10-year job"" and he does not have the ""right qualities"". Former army officer Dan Jarvis was elected MP for Barnsley Central in a by-election in 2011, having resigned his commission as a major in the Parachute Regiment to contest the seat.He held onto his seat at the general election, taking time out from campaigning to run the London Marathon last month.After entering Parliament in 2010, he quickly became a shadow culture, media and sport minister and later a shadow justice minister.In 2011, Mr Jarvis became the first serving politician in more than 60 years to be awarded a military honour, when he was made an MBE for his services to the armed forces.He has been touted by some colleagues as a future Labour leader but Mr Jarvis, who was widowed in 2010 and has a young family, ruled himself out, saying it is not the ""right time"" for him and his family. Historian and journalist Tristram Hunt entered Parliament in 2010 as Labour MP for Stoke-on-Trent Central.Ed Miliband made him shadow education secretary in 2013 and he has been a fierce critic of the coalition's education policies in England.Speaking in the aftermath of the election results, he called on Labour's ruling National Executive Committee ""not to rush our election"", saying there was time for a ""brutal post-mortem"" about Labour's ""underlying philosophy and thinking"".As for his own ambitions, he said ""it's about the lyrics as much as the lead singer I think"".He later said he was not confident of getting enough nominations to stand, and would support Liz Kendall.The MP for Rochdale says the deputy leader vacancy has ""come a bit too soon"" for him.He previously said a number of colleagues had asked him to put his name forward for the role.Mr Danczuk is well known for his prominent campaigning against child sex abuse and leading calls for an inquiry into allegations of historical child sex abuse by senior figures at Westminster.He was a vocal critic of Ed Miliband and in an article for the Daily Telegraph on Thursday he said Labour needed to ""step out if its Metropolitan comfort zone"" and ""reach out to the country once more.""The former director of public prosecutions has only just become an MP after being elected in Frank Dobson's old seat of Holborn and St Pancras, in North London at the general election.He was forced to rule himself out of the race to be Labour leader following a social media campaign urging him to stand.He said he was ""flattered"" by the campaign but the party needed someone with ""more political experience"".The older brother of ex-leader Ed, David Miliband was frontrunner to replace Gordon Brown in 2010, until his sibling beat him by a whisker.A former foreign secretary and MP for South Shields, he was the Blairite choice for leader but eventually quit Parliament to become head of the International Rescue Committee charity in New York in 2013.Speaking to the BBC from the US on the Monday after the general election, Mr Miliband criticised his brother's campaign in the 2015 general election, saying he and Mr Brown had ""allowed themselves to be portrayed as moving backwards from the principles of aspiration and inclusion that are the absolute heart of any successful progressive political project"".While he acknowledged the two men were ""brothers for life"", he also confirmed he was not eligible to stand for the party leadership as he is not an MP.Labour's election rulesMPs wishing to stand as leader and deputy leader have to be nominated by 15% of their colleagues in the Parliamentary Labour Party to be eligible to stand.As Labour now has 232 MPs, this means prospective candidates must get at least 34 signatures. That means the maximum size of any field is six contenders.Under rules agreed last year, all Labour Party members, registered supporters and affiliated supporters - including union members - will be allowed a maximum of one vote each on a one member, one vote system. When the election is held, they will be asked to rank candidates in order of preference.If no candidate gets 50% of all votes cast, the votes will be added up and the candidate with the fewest votes eliminated. Their 2nd preference votes will then be redistributed until one candidate has 50% of all votes cast."
2015-05-22,What Britain wants from Europe,https://web.archive.org//web/20150524033726/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32695399,"David Cameron says he has a mandate to pursue EU reform following the Conservatives' general election victory. The PM, who will be hoping his majority government will give him extra leverage in Brussels, wants to renegotiate the terms of the UK's membership ahead of a referendum by the end of 2017. He has said he will campaign for Britain to remain in the EU if he gets the reforms he wants.Mr Cameron has said he does not want to reveal full details of his negotiating hand but he has given a broad indication, in a series of speeches and newspaper articles, of his priorities when he goes into talks with other EU leaders.These are: The prime minister has said Britain would resist any move towards a European Army and that he wants to free British police forces from EU interference. He has also ruled out Britain joining the euro.But he has placed less emphasis in recent years on demanding changes to EU social policy, such as the maximum 48-hour working week, agency workers, maternity leave and non-discrimination rules.The official UK government position is that a referendum will be held by the end of 2017 but Downing Street sources have said: ""If we can do it earlier we will.""There is speculation David Cameron is planning to hold the vote in 2016 to avoid a clash with French and German elections in 2017.The prime minister wants treaty change but even if the referendum was held in 2017 there may not be enough time to legally incorporate any reforms into a treaty and it would have to be done at a later stage.An early referendum would anger Eurosceptics who believe it would not allow enough time to make the case for exit or negotiate any meaningful concessions.""A rushed process would severely undermine the chances to secure a significant deal that both British business and voters could support and would waste the opportunity of a lifetime,"" Matthew Elliott, chief executive of Business for Britain told Breitbart London.The question is always crucial in any referendum and there is already a debate about what it should be. The Draft European Union (Referendum) Bill, published by the Conservatives in 2013, proposed this form of words: ""Do you think that the United Kingdom should remain a member of the European Union?""Some thought that leaned too far towards the status quo, encouraging a yes vote, and the Electoral Commission said it was not clear and direct enough. The watchdog proposed this form of words instead: ""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union?""The new Conservative government will attempt to repeal the Human Rights Act, which requires UK courts to treat the European Court of Human Rights as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. The European Court of Human Rights is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe (CoE), which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine.The freedom for people to move around Europe, enshrined in the EU treaties, works in parallel with the other three basic freedoms in the single market: freedom of goods, capital and services.It is likely to be a ""red line"" for other EU leaders, who do not want to see it eroded.Mr Cameron has steered clear of tackling it directly - for example by asking for an emergency ""brake"" on free movement, or a cap on numbers - focusing instead on reducing the incentive provided by welfare payments. In a speech last November, David Cameron set out measures to reduce the number of EU nationals moving to the UK.His main proposals were:Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission, has said he is ready to work with Mr Cameron to ""strike a fair deal for the United Kingdom in the EU"". The leaders of other EU nations have previously warned they are unlikely to support major changes to EU treaties to accommodate British demands. But Mr Cameron's general election victory may have given him extra leverage. ""The ball is very much in the court of the UK now,"" a senior EU official told The Guardian. ""It's up to the British to define what they want."" The key figure will be German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is very keen to keep Britain in the EU but has so far been unwilling to make major concessions to enable that to happen. There are fears that a ""pick and mix"" approach to EU treaties would undermine EU cohesion.Mr Cameron has said there is ""no doubt"" his planned reforms will require changes to the treaties governing the European Union. But this would require the unanimous support of all EU members, and may not be possible within the deadline he has set of a referendum before the end of 2017. Any attempt to change EU laws on free movement would meet fierce resistance from some EU nations, particularly Eastern European states. Mr Juncker has said free movement is non-negotiable.Mr Cameron may find it difficult to get unanimous support for his proposals for a four-year waiting period for migrant workers claiming UK benefits. East European EU members would be likely to oppose this, on the grounds that it would discriminate against their citizens.  Attempts to secure opt-outs for the City are unlikely to go down well with other European leaders.However, there are precedents for EU treaty changes to accommodate some countries' specific concerns - for example, the protocol attached to the Lisbon Treaty for Ireland.Mr Cameron has faced repeated calls to say whether he would campaign for Britain's exit from the EU in the referendum if he fails to get what he wants from the renegotiation process. All he has said is that he will ""rule nothing out"". Some Conservative MPs want Britain to leave the EU no matter what David Cameron manages to renegotiate. A larger group are likely to want more concessions than Mr Cameron has so far indicated he is prepared to demand.Senior backbencher David Davis, who was defeated by Mr Cameron for the Tory leadership in 2005, told the Daily Telegraph the majority of the 332 Conservative MPs want Mr Cameron to negotiate an ""opt-out"" power to stop individual EU laws from applying to Britain. The prime minister has said this would be ""impossible"" without Britain leaving the EU.Mr Davis claims as many as 60 Tory MPs would be prepared to rebel and vote for Britain's exit from the EU if the prime minister fails to deliver.Graham Brady, chairman of the Tory backbench 1922 committee, which represents backbenchers, has urged David Cameron to give all Conservative MPs, including ministers, a free vote in the EU referendum.In January, Mr Cameron warned that serving cabinet ministers would have to quit the government if they wanted to campaign to leave the EU if he had secured the reforms to it he wants.In the 1975 referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Economic Community, as the EU was then called, Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson decided to suspend collective responsibility because his cabinet was split on the issue. Ministers were allowed to vote with their consciences and campaign against each other. The majority of them, including Mr Wilson, joined the Yes camp, but left-wingers, such as Tony Benn, played a leading role in the No campaign. The Yes campaign won easily with 67% of the vote."

2015-05-22,Man overboard,https://web.archive.org//web/20150524033726/http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-32830379,"Harold Wilson died 20 years ago, on 24 May 1995. He would have died many years before that, writes novelist Isabel Wolff, had her family not saved him from drowning. As a child I spent many family holidays on the Isles of Scilly, 28 miles off the Cornish coast. We'd spend our time walking, cycling and, best of all, rock-pooling.  But where we would normally expect to catch a few shrimps and the odd crab, there was one memorable year when we pulled the Leader of Her Majesty's Opposition out of the water.  It was 10 August 1973 and we were enjoying a bike ride around the largest island, St Mary's. I was with my parents, my elder brother Simon, 16, then a pupil at Rugby School, his best friend Robert, and my younger brother, Matthew, who was 10.  As we cycled along a path above an isolated bay, Matthew spotted an empty rubber dinghy racing out to the open sea. As we watched it speed towards the horizon we wondered whose it was and why it was loose.  Suddenly my father said that he thought he'd heard a cry. Sure enough, above the buffeting of the wind we could just make out a distressed male voice. My father cupped his hands and shouted: ""What is your trouble?""  ""I can't get into my boat,"" the voice answered. ""Fetch a dinghy!""  We pedalled down to the bay as fast as we could.  My father yelled: ""We'll get to you in a few minutes. Can you hold on?""  ""Yes - for a bit,"" came the faint reply. While Robert sped off to alert the Coastguard, Simon found a dinghy - but it had no oars. My father hurriedly looked around for a pair but then, further off, saw a wooden ""pram"" dinghy, its oars still in its rowlocks.  He and Simon carried this to the water's edge and, with Simon guiding him, my father rowed out towards a group of motor launches moored about 300 yards from the shore. While they did this my mother, Matthew and I waited on the beach, which was deserted except for a benign looking Labrador chained up by a fisherman's hut.  The dog's name tag said ""Paddy"" and Matthew and I stroked his ears while we anxiously waited for events to unfold.   Twenty minutes later we saw my father and Simon coming back. Hunched between them in the boat was a bedraggled looking, but familiar figure.  ""It's Harold Wilson,"" I said.  As my father rowed towards the quay, the Labour leader suddenly stood up, nearly swamping the boat. He then sat down again until it had docked, and Simon helped him onto dry land.  I vividly recall how shocked he looked. His shorts and shirt were drenched, his hair was plastered to his scalp, his teeth were chattering and his face was white.  He declined my father's offer of further help, including the loan of a bike to get back to his bungalow, but said that he was glad that we'd come along when we did.  My father jovially responded that it wasn't every day one pulled a former prime minister out of the water and that we were happy to have been able to help.  Satisfied that Wilson was all right, we left him with Paddy and cycled away.  As we ate our picnic lunch my father and Simon explained that Wilson had slipped into the sea while attempting to step from his rubber dinghy onto his motor launch.  The dinghy had shot away from him - the dinghy that we'd seen.  Unable to pull himself into the boat, Wilson had been left hanging on to the fender ropes for dear life. He'd told them that he'd been feeling sea-sick and that his arms felt ""numb"" and were ""giving out"".  Simon had stepped on to Wilson's boat and had then hauled the man on to the deck ""like a sack of potatoes"".  Dad then swore us all to secrecy - if the story got out it could ruin the opposition leader's holiday, and our own.  The next morning we went down to Porthcressa and by chance we saw Wilson coming off the beach.   I remember thinking that he'd be happy to see us again - perhaps he'd even ask us to tea? To my surprise I saw a flash of irritation cross his face.   My father greeted him and asked how he was.  He replied that he felt all right, if rather stiff, and that he had spent the rest of the day in bed.  ""I've had my swim for the holiday though,"" he added pleasantly, then he went on his way and we didn't see him again.  Returning home after the holiday we told no-one what had happened but somehow, a month later, the story got out.  First my father was approached by our local paper which made the story a splash: ""Rugby Family Rescues Mr. Wilson From Sea."" This got picked up by the Birmingham Post and within 48 hours my father's face was on the front of every national newspaper.  Headlines such as ""Wilson Snatched From Drowning"" and ""Wilson Rescued in Sea Drama"" amused us, but we were outraged by the Daily Mirror's ""My Dog Tipped me In!""  In a piece of Labour spin, Wilson's press secretary, Joe Haines, had apparently blamed the labrador.  There was even a photo of ""the culprit"", Paddy, who was ""in the doghouse"".  One could see the need for damage limitation - the incident was extremely embarrassing for Wilson, not least because the Prime Minister Ted Heath was a world-class yachtsman. There were cartoons of Heath grinning at the news on board his yacht, Morning Cloud.  My father, a nuclear engineer, was besieged at work by TV film crews and quizzed about his voting habits. ""Lifelong Tory Saves Wilson from Drowning"", announced the Daily Telegraph.  The Times pointed out that the Labour Leader, whose party had pledged to end private education, had been rescued by a public schoolboy.  And so it went on. We put up with myriad jokes of the ""Why didn't you throw him back?"" variety.  In the meantime Haines continued to elaborate on the story.  Wilson, he claimed in the Mirror, was in ""no danger"".  He ""could have swum to the beach"" but was ""waiting for a friend"".  The truth is, Harold Wilson would have died.  Aged 57, he'd been in the cold water, never more than 15C on Scilly, for more than half an hour.  Knowing the strong Atlantic currents, he hadn't dared risk the long swim back to the beach.  Worst of all, in that deserted spot, there had been no-one to hear his cries.   Reflecting on the incident afterwards, my father told us that Wilson seemed not to understand that it was ""only by the slenderest margins"" that his life had been saved.  Six months later, in February 1974, Harold Wilson became prime minister again.It's now 42 years since ""The Wilson Affair"" as my family always called it.  It seems strange that despite all the publicity this very significant event in the life of Wilson is almost unknown.  Neither of his official biographers, Ben Pimlott and Philip Ziegler, mentioned it in their respective books, nor did Joe Haines revisit it in his own memoir of Wilson, Glimmers of Twilight.  I sometimes wondered how Wilson's colleagues had viewed the story at the time. Were they sympathetic? Amused?  Did they pull his leg about it?  ""Oh I remember it well,"" Denis Healey told me when I phoned him in the House of Lords a few months ago. ""Harold seemed very embarrassed by it and was clearly anxious to play the whole thing down.  We didn't feel that we could mention it to him - definitely not.""  And if my family hadn't happened to pass by when we did?  It's fair to say that the course of British politics might have been rather different.  Denis Healey or Jim Callaghan might have succeeded Wilson. Edward Heath might not have been defeated in 1974 and there might well have been no Tory leadership challenge the following year and therefore, quite possibly, no Thatcher premiership.  My late brother, Simon, used to wonder whether our father may, on that fateful August day, have inadvertently launched Margaret  Thatcher's prime ministerial career. The rest, as they say, is history.Isabel Wolff is author of GhostwrittenSubscribe to the BBC News Magazine's email newsletter to get articles sent to your inbox"
2015-05-22,Out or in?,https://web.archive.org//web/20150524033726/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32793642,"David Cameron has promised a referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Union by the end of 2017. Here is a summary of the key arguments for and against British membership.If Britain votes to leave the EU, it will have to negotiate a new trading relationship with what would now be a 27 member organisation, to allow British firms to sell goods and services to EU countries without being hit by excessive tariffs and other restrictions.Better off out: Britain could negotiate an ""amicable divorce"", but retain strong trading links with EU nations, say those campaigning for Britain's exit. There are several potential scenarios:Better off in: An ""amicable divorce"" is a pipe dream, pro-EU campaigners argue. France, Germany and other leading EU nations would never allow Britain a ""pick and mix"" approach to the bloc's rules. Norway and Switzerland have to abide by many EU rules without any influence over how they are formed. Negotiating a comprehensive free trade agreement could take years and have an uncertain outcome. And if Britain went for a completely clean break with the EU its exports would be subject to tariffs and would still have to meet EU production standards, harming the competitiveness of British business.The run-up to the EU referendum is likely to be dominated by competing claims about how many millions of jobs will be lost or gained by Britain's exit. All such claims come with a health warning. Coming up with a precise figure is difficult as there is no way of knowing if threats by foreign companies to scale back their operations in the UK would come to pass or, indeed, how many jobs would be created by the reshaped economy that might emerge in the wake of an exit.Better off out: There would be a jobs boom as firms are freed from EU regulations and red tape, say those arguing for an exit, with small- and medium-sized companies who don't trade with the EU benefiting the most. In its recent paper, the EU Jobs Myth, the free market Institute for Economic Affairs seeks to debunk the claim that 3-4 million jobs would be lost if Britain left. ""Jobs are associated with trade, not membership of a political union, and there is little evidence to suggest that trade would substantially fall between British businesses and European consumers in the event the UK was outside the EU,"" it argues. ""The UK labour market is incredibly dynamic, and would adapt quickly to changed relationships with the EU.""Better off in: Millions of jobs would be lost as global manufacturers moved to lower-cost EU countries. Britain's large, foreign-owned car industry would be particularly at risk. ""The attractiveness of the UK as a place to invest and do automotive business is clearly underpinned by the UK's influential membership of the EU,"" said a KPMG report on the car industry last year. The financial services sector, which employs about 2.1 million people in the UK, also has concerns about a British exit. ""The success of the UK financial services industry is to a large extent built on EU Internal Market legislation. To abandon this for some untried, unknown and unpredictable alternative would carry very significant risks,"" said global law firm Clifford Chance in a report by think tank TheCityUK last year.Much would depend on the trade deals Britain managed to negotiate with the EU and rest of the world after its exit. The best-case scenario, according to think tank Open Europe, is that the UK would be better off by 1.6% of GDP a year by 2030. That is assuming the UK carried out widespread deregulation after its exit and managed to strike favourable trade deals. The think tank adds: ""A far more realistic range is between a 0.8% permanent loss to GDP in 2030 and a 0.6% permanent gain in GDP in 2030, in scenarios where Britain mixes policy approaches"".The Centre for Economic Performance, at the London School of Economics, says the worst-case scenario is a 6.3% to 9.5% reduction in GDP, ""a loss of a similar size to that resulting from the global financial crisis of 2008/09"". The best case, according to their analysis, is a loss of 2.2% of GDP.Better off out: Britain would regain full control of its borders. UKIP wants to see a work permit system introduced, so that EU nationals would face the same visa restrictions as those from outside the EU, which it says would reduce population growth from current levels of 298,000 a year to about 50,000. This would create job opportunities for British workers and boost wages, as well as easing pressure on schools, hospitals and other public services. Better off in: Britain might have to agree to allow free movement of EU migrants as the price of being allowed access to the free market. In any case, immigration from the rest of the EU has been good for Britain's economy. The UK's growth forecasts are based, in part, on continued high levels of net migration. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility says the economy relies on migrant labour and taxes paid by immigrants to keep funding public services.The UK's net contribution to the EU, taking into account the rebate, was £11.3bn in 2013. That is more than four times what it was in 2008. It is about the same amount as the UK government spends on transport every year.Better off out: The UK would save billions in membership fees, and end the ""hidden tariff"" paid by UK taxpayers when goods are exported to the EU, caused by red tape, waste, fraud and other factors. Better off in: The UK's contribution to the EU budget is a drop in the ocean compared with the benefits to business of being in the single market. Better off out: The EU is not as important to British trade as it used to be, and continuing turmoil in the eurozone will make it even less so. Even if Britain did not manage to negotiate a free trade deal with the EU it would not be as disastrous as EU-enthusiasts claim, argues economist Roger Bootle in his book The Trouble with Europe: ""It would place the UK in the same position as the US is currently in, along with India, China and Japan, all of which manage to export to the EU relatively easily."" The UK would be free to establish bilateral trade agreements with fast-growing export markets such as China, Singapore, Brazil, Russia and India through the World Trade Organisation. Better off in: The EU is the UK's main trading partner, worth more than £400bn a year, or 52% of the total trade in goods and services. Complete withdrawal from the EU would see trade barriers erected, with car exports to the EU, for example, facing a 15% tariff and imports a tariff of 10%.  ""The idea that the UK would be freer outside the EU is based on a series of misconceptions, that a medium-sized, open economy could hold sway in an increasingly fractured trading system dominated by the US, the EU and China; that the EU makes it harder for Britain to penetrate emerging markets; and that foreign capital would be more attracted to Britain's economy if it were no longer part of the single market,"" the pro-EU Centre for European Reform said in a recent report.Better off out: The UK would remain a key part of Nato and the UN Security Council and a nuclear power, with a powerful global voice in its own right. The Eurosceptic Bruges Group wants an end to the ""discredited"" principle that Britain acts as a transatlantic bridge between the US and Europe, saying the country should make self-reliance its guiding principle.Better off in: Stripped of influence in Brussels, Berlin and Paris, Britain would find itself increasingly ignored by Washington and sidelined on big transnational issues such as the environment, security and trade. America and other allies want Britain to remain in the EU. The UK risks becoming a maverick, isolated state if it leaves.Better off out: Britain would gain full control of its own borders, with migration in and out of the country regulated solely by British law. It would be more difficult for EU citizens to move to the UK, although those already living here are unlikely to be removed. Better off in: A lot would depend on what kind of deal was reached with the other EU nations. Britons may have to apply for visas to enter EU countries and those already living there may face integration rules, such as proving they can speak the language before gaining long-term residency rights. There would also be uncertainty for many EU workers now paying taxes in the UK - what benefits, if any, would they be entitled to?Better off out: The EU has limited power over tax, which is largely a matter for national governments. The exception is VAT, which has bands agreed at the EU level. Outside the EU, the UK would potentially have more flexibility.Better off in:  ""Tax avoidance and evasion will reach crippling levels as our economy becomes increasingly wholly owned by foreign multinationals that make tax avoidance in Britain central to their business strategy,"" argued the pro-European The Observer newspaper in an editorial.Better off out: It would be a major shot in the arm for British democracy as the Westminster parliament regained its sovereignty and reconnected with voters. The country would be free from the European Arrest Warrant and other law and order measures.Better off in: Britons benefit from EU employment laws and social protections, which would be stripped away. Withdrawal from the European Arrest Warrant could mean delays for the UK in extraditing suspects from other European countries; and the UK already has some opt-outs from EU labour law, including the Working Time Directive."
2015-05-22,Mark Mardell,https://web.archive.org//web/20150524033726/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32803419,"The UK's future direction for at least a generation hangs precariously on an uncertainty, balanced on the tip of the unknown.I am talking of course about the planned referendum on the EU.  The brilliant thing about referendums, and one of the features that makes them so irksome for politicians is their binary clarity - ""Yes"" or ""No"", ""In"" or ""Out"".This one will be like that, but it isn't at the moment. For now, the most important group of potential voters are the ""Maybes"".They are not unsure because they are hesitant Harrys and Harriets who haven't grasped the big issues.It is much more political than that.  Some big names are rallying around the banner of ""Maybe"".The Foreign Secretary Phillip Hammond is one of them, and perhaps the most important is the mop-headed mayhap Boris Johnson. Their eventual decision depends, they say, on what change in the relationship David Cameron manages to negotiate - and that may well depend on what they and others argue, in political cabinet, he should demand. This is unknown because it is as yet undecided. Indeed, I am fairly sure almost all Conservative MPs will be herded into the ""Maybe"" camp by a twitch of deferent loyalty on one flank, the cracking whip of strategic cunning on the other.Those who know with certainty in their own hearts they will vote ""No"" may feel they have to give the prime minister a chance, or appear grossly disloyal. This has the added advantage that having played the part of a loyalist waiting with open-jawed admiration for the prime minister to return home with a piece of paper, their eventual disappointment will pack more heft. At the end of the process, they can declare that, despite all their high expectations, the deal is not good enough, and the obdurate EU has left them with no choice but to campaign for an ""Out"".  Equally, those who are determined to stay in might as well drape themselves in temporary Euroscepticism and mutter about how hard it is for Mr Cameron to ""squeeze anything out of that lot"".  When Mr Cameron returns with a deal, however paltry,  they can proclaim it a master stroke that forces them into the ""Yes"" camp. Still, some will have a genuine bottom line.It is not clear if the prime minister himself is one of them.He has set out, in rather loose terms, his aims, in the Sunday Telegraph last March.The trouble with most of them is that success would be difficult to measure. We will legislate in the first session of the next Parliament for an in-out referendum to be held on Britain's membership of the EU before the end of 2017. We will negotiate a new settlement for Britain in the EU. And then we will ask the British people whether they want to stay in on this basis, or leave. We will protect our economy from any further integration of the Eurozone. The integration of the Eurozone has raised acute questions for non-Eurozone countries like the UK. We benefit from the single market and do not want to stand in the way of the Eurozone resolving its difficulties.But we will not let the integration of the Eurozone jeopardise the integrity of the single market or in any way disadvantage the UK.We want to see powers flowing away from Brussels, not to it. We want national parliaments to be able to work together to block unwanted European legislation. And we want an end to our commitment to an ""ever closer union"", as enshrined in the treaty to which every EU country has to sign up.What sort of change would ensure ""businesses liberated from red tape"" or ""powers flowing away from Brussels""? Words alone would not suffice for those who think such changes are vital if the UK is to stay in the EU - after all, the European Commission would say it backs both. ""Free movement to take up work, not free benefits"" is more concrete and eminently achievable but may not look like the ""fundamental"" change in relationship that is promised. But ""new mechanisms in place to prevent vast migrations across the Continent"" looks much easier to declare as a ""win"" or ""lose"".After persistent warnings, particularly from German Chancellor Angela Merkel, that ""free movement of people"" was not up for grabs, the prime minister appeared to drop the idea. But he told the House of Commons only two months ago: ""In the coming two years, we have the opportunity to reform the EU and fundamentally change Britain's relationship with it. ""We have the opportunity to build a European Union that is more competitive, more flexible and more accountable to the people, where powers flow back to member states, not just away from them, and where freedom of movement is no longer an unqualified right.""How much would the EU have to qualify that right, to persuade the doubters?Would a promise to stop putative Serbians coming to Britain after their country joins, in perhaps 2030, do the trick? Again, that is unknown and uncertain.At the moment, most backbenchers are keeping their heads down and powder dry. But Jacob Rees Mogg, MP for North East Somerset and member of the European Scrutiny Committee in the last Parliament, told me: ""I think the touchstone for renegotiation will be the free movement of people. ""It is one of the four freedoms of the European Union, and if the EU is  willing to give ground on that it will show that it is willing to consider a fundamental reform rather than just tinkering at the edges. ""So it is symbolically important as well as representing a deep concern of the British people.""This is admirable in its clarity, and I suspect it will be a  touchstone too for many of his colleagues. Others may set the bar higher or lower, but one new MP told me: ""I wouldn't like to be in the prime minister's shoes.""He knows it has to be real - he can't just come back with a bit of polish on it."" The prime minister's challenge is to come back with a deal so bright and sunny that the snows of uncertainty melt away to reveal the sunny uplands of victory. Is that likely? Maybe."
2015-05-22,Peer problems?,https://web.archive.org//web/20150524033726/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32725118,"When David Cameron heads to the House of Lords for the Queen's Speech later this month he might want to cast his eye along the red benches. Sitting there will be scores of peers who - when the ermine robes are off and Parliament gets back to business - could start causing a bit of trouble for the government.Managing Mr Cameron's small majority in the Commons - 12 MPs - is going to require some skill from the party whips. But it could turn out to be an easy day at the office compared with handling the complicated mechanics of the Lords where the Conservatives aren't even close to a majority.The numbers - see below - don't add up for the prime minister in the ""upper chamber"".Together, Labour and the Lib Dems have 315 peers - enough to beat the Conservatives by 91 votes. Then there are the crossbench - or independent - peers to think about.  They're hard to predict as they don't vote as a block.  In the worst-case scenario for the Conservatives, their 224 peers are up against a whopping 555 from other parties and groups. On the other hand the crossbenchers could, in theory, help the Conservatives win.  As Professor Meg Russell, Director of the Constitution Unit at University College London, notes: ""The Conservatives are in a relatively weak position in the Lords, holding less than a third of seats. The government can readily be defeated by various combinations of other forces.""Policies that could stir up objections in the Lords include abolishing the Human Rights Act and legislation paving the way for an EU referendum. It's very unusual for peers to vote against an entire Bill. Their style is to go through legislation amending bits they don't like. The government can either accept the changes or overturn them in the Commons. Maybe David Cameron will start wishing he'd pushed on with plans, three years ago, to introduce elected peers. He abandoned the proposals in the face of opposition from Conservative MPs and peers. It was another reprieve for the House of Lords, which has survived numerous attempts at reform over the last 100 years.And there won't be another existential crisis for the time being. The Conservative election manifesto states that they see a ""strong case"" for introducing an ""elected element"" but ""it isn't a priority in the next Parliament"".With wounds to lick and new leaders to choose, Lib Dem and Labour strategists aren't thinking too deeply about their tactics in the  Lords. But as politicians drift back to Westminster the possibilities are starting to bleep on the political radar.Labour peer Lord Foulkes has already been tweeting about what he calls the ""difficult job"" facing the Leader of the Lords, Baroness Stowell, whose task is to get government business through.He predicts ""interesting times"", saying: ""Labour and the Liberal Democrats have a huge majority over the Conservatives. The crossbenchers are unpredictable but on a number of occasions they have come with us. The Lib Dems in the Lords are old-fashioned Lib Dems. They'll be happier working with us than the Tories.""The Liberal Democrats are leading lights in the campaign to turn the House of Lords into an elected chamber. It's a cruel irony that with only eight MPs, the Lib Dems will be relying on an institution they dislike to give them a solid platform at Westminster.How will they get along with their former coalition partners though? The Lib Dem peer, Baroness Hussein-Ece, said the Conservatives were now ""off the leash"" but wouldn't be getting ""an easy ride"".""The dynamics are going to be completely different. We will take things on a policy-by-policy basis. I feel quite passionately about keeping the Human Rights Act and I'm pretty sure that my colleagues will be opposing abolition vociferousIy.""But David Cameron can take some comfort from the fact that the Lib Dems will not be falling into Labour's arms. Baroness Hussein-Ece is certain there will be issues the two parties can agree on but is equally sure they will not form a happy union as a matter of course. She said: ""I'm afraid that the Labour Party is more interested in tribal politics. It could have conducted itself in a more progressive way during the election."" In the last Parliament, the coalition government was defeated 103 times in the Lords and a Labour source in the Lords predicts that the Conservatives will ""want to make up for lost time"". He said: ""What we anticipate is that they will start to look back at the concessions they made and the opposition amendments that got through.""And the feeling is that the government will find ways to use secondary legislation - which empowers ministers to adjust some laws.By convention, the House of Lords is reluctant to challenge policies promised in election manifestos and doesn't vote against measures on taxation and spending. But Professor Russell thinks the rules around those conventions are ""far from clear"" and that Labour and the Lib Dems might be tempted to block what they see as Conservative ""austerity"" measures. Meg Russell says: ""The House of Lords is a complicated place. Historically at least, they have always been very sensitive to public opinion. They are not likely to go in all guns blazing.""How can David Cameron deal with trouble in the Lords - even if it is well-meaning and principled?He can't get rid of any peers but he could, in theory, create a huge number of new Conservative peers to give him a stronger base. ""There are no rules,"" Meg Russell adds of the possibility. ""The prime minister has complete patronage. But of course it wouldn't go down well with the  public and there would be an outcry in Parliament.""And introducing too many new peers would also be embarrassing because the Conservatives have promised to tackle the size of the chamber. With 779 active members, it's one of the largest in the world.The Conservative Lord Cormack thinks that the prime minister shouldn't worry too much because he can rely on the Lords to behave ""with a considerable degree of sense"".""There will be stormy patches and it's always over the things that you don't predict,"" he says. ""But the important thing to do is play to the strengths of the Lords. There's an enormous accumulation of wisdom and experience. It generally improves bills."" He is relaxed about the next few years. ""I don't anticipate any unpleasantness. For the government to be defeated in the House of Lords isn't the end of the world."" And that's because, he said, the Lords believes in the supremacy of the Commons.It may be a while before the new dynamics in the Lords play out. The first bills will be unveiled in the Queen's Speech on 27th May and any controversial ones may not reach the House of Lords until after the summer break.But there's one other constitutional niggle to mention. In theory, all parties should be represented in the House of Lords - even the small ones. The Greens have one peer and UKIP has three. But there are no members of the SNP in the House of Lords. And with 56 MPs, it means the Lords isn't speaking for millions of people in Scotland. The SNP is adamant, though, that it doesn't want anything to do with the place.With the Lords potentially a powerful force, are the Scottish Nationalists missing a trick?Not according to the SNP MP Pete Wishart who declared: ""It's an affront to democracy. We will have nothing to do with this democratic outrage. The House of Lords doesn't need reform. We need to abolish it and start again."""
2015-05-22,Olive branches or burning bridges?,https://web.archive.org//web/20150524033726/http://www.bbc.com/news/education-32796618,"When Nicky Morgan became education secretary last year her biggest strength and biggest problem were the same thing - not being Michael Gove.Her predecessor had cast a long shadow, having dominated the education landscape and in many ways re-made it in his own likeness.Mrs Morgan was introduced as a less confrontational figure, offering an olive branch to a teaching profession that had felt that it was being used for target practice.But many of the questions she faced were about how she defined herself against the Gove legacy, rather than about her own vision.Now she is back under her own steam, authority enhanced and able to stamp her own identity on the Department for Education.So what will be the direction of schools in England under Mrs Morgan? Will it be more olive branches? Or will it be more burning bridges?The first education bill of the new Parliament promises to create hundreds of academies and free schools, with plans to replace the leadership of schools that are struggling. So no surprises there, it's going to be more of the same.And it will raise the same questions about whether structural change really raises standards.But so much of this debate is about the rhetoric rather than the reality - and head teachers have been bristling at the language of threats to send in teams of new leaders to ""failing and coasting schools"".Heads' leaders have been irritated that the public discourse is already so negative.And they ask where are all these armies of superstar replacement heads waiting to be ""parachuted"" into schools?The ""coasting school"" motif really irritates them, not least because it's such a vague term, leaving many heads unsure whether they should be looking over their shoulder.But maybe they should see it as part of the cycle of government.""Hundreds of schools in England which are considered to be 'coasting' are facing a government crackdown."" This was a story from 2007, with an almost identical threat of such lacklustre schools being taken over.And it wasn't even new then. ""The school standards watchdog in England is to crack down on 'coasting' schools"". That was from 1999 - and it annoyed head teachers then too.It's also worth noting that Ofsted at the same time announced that schools would only receive from six to 10 working weeks' notice of an inspection, instead of two terms. It's now less than one day's notice.And schools are still ""coasting"".One of the balancing acts for Mrs Morgan will be how to keep school leaders on board, as serious professional partners, when at the same time the political language about education often reverts into accusations and threats.Heads say they are facing big practical pressures in the next five years - hundreds of thousands of extra pupils needing places, fears of a shortage of teachers and head teachers, and worries about over-stretched budgets.Constantly talking about academies seems an ideological sideshow to them.And the engagement of heads will be crucial in what is going to be a major task for the next five years - rolling out the curriculum and qualifications reforms announced under the previous coalition government. There are bound to be some unforeseen bumps, and downright craters, in this delivery phase.Mrs Morgan has promised that the next five years will see an end to ""constant change"". There was a strong message to teachers during the election campaign that there would be more bedding in and less uprooting.And that means finding a way to avoid any more headline-grabbing changes, without looking like this is an administration that is becalmed. She'll have to show that less is more.But there are still questions to be decided which will be seen as symbolic. Not least about whether to allow a Kent grammar school to open a satellite branch in another town.Speaking privately, heads' leaders say there seems to be a balancing act.Mrs Morgan is described as being much more accessible and wanting a better relationship with the teaching profession - and the atmosphere in the Department for Education is described as ""completely different"" than in the Gove era.They describe ministers as being ""very upbeat"".But head teachers still bridle at what seems to be a very different political tone, that they criticise as negative towards schools, lacking in evidence and counter-productive.Good cop, bad cop? Mrs Morgan now has the chance to establish her own classroom style."
2015-05-22,New-look Commons,https://web.archive.org//web/20150524033726/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32795139,"MPs are back at Westminster to be sworn in as the new Parliament gets under way. But what's new this time around? Here are some things to look out for:Television viewers will get a new perspective on our politicians, thanks to eye-level cameras in the Commons. Approved by the House of Commons Commission in February, the cameras offer an alternative to the traditional high-level fixed positions to which viewers have become accustomed over the years. It comes after TV cameras were allowed into previously forbidden parts of the Palace of Westminster for the BBC's Inside the Commons documentary.The number of women in Parliament has risen by about a third to 191. Female MPs now make up 29% of the overall total. The proportion of female Conservative and Labour MPs has increased, despite an overall fall in the number of Labour MPs. But the biggest rise in female representation in the Commons came from the Scottish National Party, which now has 20 female MPs, up from just one.Labour MP Sir Gerald Kaufman is the new Father of the House, the title given to the MP with the longest continuous service who is not a minister.The member for Manchester Gorton replaces Conservative Sir Peter Tapsell, who stood down as MP at the election. His main duty, as demonstrated on Monday, is to preside over the election of a new Speaker.First elected in 1970, Sir Gerald pips three other MPs - Conservatives Ken Clarke and Michael Meacher, and Dennis Skinner of Labour, who all entered Parliament on the same day - because he swore the oath before them.Labour's acting leader Harriet Harman appointed herself to the unofficial title after pointing out she was the longest-serving female MP in the Commons. The MP for Camberwell and Peckham, first elected in 1982, made the comments during the Speaker's election exchanges, ""to prevent us all from falling headlong into patriarchy"" and promised ""good parenting"" along with Mr Kaufman.At 20 years of age, the SNP's Mhairi Black is the UK's youngest elected MP since 1667.The MP for Paisley and Renfrewshire South, who ousted shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander, found herself surrounded by Labour MPs on the green benches during the Speaker election. The politics student - who worked part-time in a chip shop before winning her seat - has been studying for her final exams in the House of Commons of Library, she revealed in an ITV interview.The influx of SNP MPs has led to some competition on the Labour benches. This was illustrated during the Speaker election as Labour MPs found themselves displaced from their familiar spots when the nationalists arrived early to bag their places. But Labour veteran Dennis Skinner held on to his traditional seat on the front corner of the far opposition bench. The Bolsover MP was spotted wedged in next to the SNP's Chris Law. ""I only had half a cheek on, but I was there before them and I will be there when they are gone,"" he told the Mirror. There are said to be just 427 seats available for MPs, and backbenchers use their prayer cards to guarantee a spot.The Liberal Democrats have been hardest hit by the new seating arrangements, with their eight MPs positioned in a distant corner of the opposition benches. It's a far cry from the days of coalition, when the likes of Nick Clegg and Danny Alexander regularly fielded questions from the despatch box.Aside from the prospect of a new Labour leader grilling Prime Minister David Cameron, the SNP will also get two questions in the weekly Parliamentary showpiece because of its third party status. Moray MP Angus Robertson, the party's Westminster leader, will get the role previously filled by the Liberal Democrats before the coalition government.The new House of Commons is more ethnically diverse than ever, with 41 non-white MPs, up from 27. And for the first time, there is an MP of Chinese origin - Alan Mak, who represents Havant for the Conservatives.Stephen Kinnock, son of former Labour leader Neil, is now an MP for the party. So is Rupa Huq, the sister of former Blue Peter presenter Konnie Huq, and Tulip Siddiq, whose aunt, Sheikh Hasina, is the prime minister of Bangladesh.The new House has 32 gay, lesbian and bisexual MPs - more than in any Parliament in any other country. According to an analysis for the New Statesman, 13 of these are Labour, and 12 are Conservative.For the first time since 1885, there are no former prime ministers anywhere in Parliament. Labour's Gordon Brown stood down at the general election, and neither of his two predecessors, Tony Blair and John Major, took seats in the House of Lords.The elections aren't over in the House of Commons, where chairmen and women have to be voted in to lead most of the Commons select committees.The committees, covering subjects like home affairs, health and transport, have an increasingly high-profile role in holding the government to account, carrying out inquiries, taking evidence from witnesses and publishing reports. Some committees, like foreign affairs and culture, media and sport, are guaranteed a new name in charge because the former holder has left Parliament or been promoted to the government.One thing that hasn't changed, to some people's surprise, is the occupant of the Speaker's chair. John Bercow was re-elected unopposed when MPs returned after the election, despite efforts by the Conservatives to make it easier for him to be unseated at the very end of the last Parliament. Meanwhile, there will be at least one new deputy Speaker - Labour MP Dawn Primarolo stood down, and elections will be held for each of the deputy posts in the coming weeks."

2015-05-23,PM announces freeze in ministers' pay,https://web.archive.org//web/20150524033726/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32863296,"Government ministers' pay will remain frozen for the next five years, David Cameron has announcedWriting in the Sunday Times, the prime minister said we were ""all in this together"" when it came to paying off the national debt.His pledge will save about £800,000 a year and £4m by 2020.The decision means ministerial pay will not have risen for a decade by the end of parliament. Cabinet ministers currently receive a salary of £134,565.This includes their pay as MPs. The prime minister is paid a total of £142,500.Mr Cameron said his decision to freeze ministerial pay for the duration of the parliament was part of his ""One Nation"" approach to tackling the deficit, and becoming a country where ""all hard-working people can get on"".He writes: ""We can't pretend there's not still a long way to go. We've halved the deficit as a share of the economy - but there's still half of it left to pay off.""So we will continue to take the difficult decisions necessary to bring spending down and secure our economy. As we go about doing that, I want people to be in no doubt: I said five years ago we were all in this together, and five years on, nothing has changed.""That's why, for example, I've decided to freeze the pay of the ministers in the government. For me, that's just one step which sends out a clear signal: that as we continue knuckling down as a country, we will all play our part.""Meanwhile, the UK's 650 MPs - who are currently paid £67,060 - are in line for a 9% pay rise later this year after the independent watchdog - known as the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA) -  said pay should rise to £74,000 after the election.Changes brought in after the 2009 expenses scandal mean MPs are no longer in charge of setting their own pay rates, instead this issue now falls within the purview of IPSA.But the government has made it clear that the scale of the IPSA's suggested increase is ""not right"" and should be reconsidered, given that public sector pay rises have been capped at 1%.Is this a surprise? No. Will it save much money? No. Is it symbolically important to the point that it would have been more newsworthy if they'd not done this? Absolutely. The prime minister acknowledges that there are ""difficult decisions"" to come, so this is important symbolically to try to prove, as he puts it, that ""we are all in this together."" What is likely to prove much more tricky is the expected big rise coming soon in the basic pay all MPs receive.After the expenses scandal, parliament decided MPs' pay should be set by an independent body. But always beware the law of unintended consequences: that body could now recommend, against the vociferous protests of the party leaders, a big hike in their pay packets.MPs are also not paid extra for their committee work, although committee chairs get a £14,000 supplement, taking their pay to £81,642.Ahead of Wednesday's Queen's Speech setting out his priorities for the first year of his new term, Mr Cameron used his newspaper column to insist that his new administration would be ""about so much more than balancing the books"".""As we return to office, after five years of a long-term economic plan and sacrifices by the British people, we're on the brink of something different - something special,"" he writes.""We can become a country where all hard-working people can get on; not a two-speed society where some can afford childcare and homes of their own and others cannot.""We can become a country where all children get the education they deserve and no-one settles for a life on benefits; so no-one's background is a barrier to their success.""In other words, we can become One Nation."""
2015-05-23,Cameron urged to make case for EU,https://web.archive.org//web/20150524033726/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32857711,"David Cameron is being urged to make a positive case for Europe if he wants to successfully renegotiate the UK's terms of membership with fellow EU leaders.Pascal Lamy, one of Europe's most senior politicians, told the BBC other leaders wanted to help Mr Cameron win a referendum but he has to help himself.Mr Lamy was director general of the World Trade Organization for 13 years.The PM has pledged to renegotiate a ""better deal"" for the UK and hold an ""in-out"" referendum by the end of 2017.Meanwhile, the Labour Party's acting leader Harriet Harman has said her party has officially dropped its opposition to holding a referendum on the issue.In an interview to be broadcast on BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend later, Mr Lamy - who now heads up the think tank Notre Europe - said he did not agree with the view ""that the Brits have always been a pain in the ass so they can leave and it would be fine"". He said the prime minister started with some credit because of his election victory.""[David Cameron] won an election in a reasonably brilliant way as a politician, as a professional of politics he did a good job and these guys are in the same job and they recognise that"", he said.""There are issues of substance, but the psychology of that matters very much.""  He warned there would be some red lines, such as free movement of people but there was a ""margin of manoeuvre"" over this and exempting the UK from ""ever closer union"". He suggested Mr Cameron's tone would be important.""Most European leaders, including myself, feel David Cameron needs to be able to make a good case for Europe in the referendum.""They need to help them but he himself must make a pro-EU case in the UK, which frankly hasn't been done for the last 15 years.""There has to be some change to the UK narrative, which will probably be the price for a compromise."" Mr Lamy said if Britain left, it would be bad news for the EU. He said in his previous jobs, he found world leaders, like the presidents of China and Brazil, felt the EU was founded on two miracles - peace between France and Germany, and British membership.""Half of the miracle would evaporate if the Brits were to leave the European Union,"" he added.On Friday, the prime minister admitted he has not found himself surrounded by a ""wall of love"", as he put it - but he will find Europe's leaders are willing to help him construct a ladder to hop over the high fence he has built for himself.Labour's Harriet Harman has also said her party would now support David Cameron's planned referendum bill, clearing a path for a ballot by the end of 2017.Writing in the Sunday Times, Ms Harman said: ""We have now had a general election and reflected on the conversations we had on doorsteps throughout the country. The British people want to have a say on the UK's membership of the European Union. ""Labour will therefore now support the EU referendum bill when it comes before the House of Commons.""But she added that although her party was no longer opposing a referendum, Labour would still be campaigning for the UK to remain part of the union.As a high profile, fervent believer in European integration Mr Pascal's words are important - and suggest the European establishment want to give Mr Cameron a deal that will help him win a referendum.If Mr Cameron failed it would inflict a grave, potentially fatal, wound on a project already under assault from numerous directions. They will have their own red lines of course, but Mr Cameron's biggest problem may well come at home. He faces Goldilocks' porridge problem - what is suitable to sup for European leaders may prove too tepid for backbenchers.

In that time he learned his brief, gained the ­experience, handled the media and won the public's trust with an overwhelming landslide.""I have seen a lot of those skills and ­qualities in Andy Burnham during his 13 years as an MP.""Many people talk about aspiration but Andy is a living example - a working-class lad from Liverpool who went to a ­comprehensive and got a place at Cambridge University. ""Andy also has that one thing all leaders crave - the common touch. ""I've seen him in small groups and big meetings. People instantly warm to the guy. He's a family man who loves his football.""Ed Miliband resigned as Labour leader after the Conservatives were elected as a majority government with 331 seats in the general election.Harriet Harman has been leading Labour temporarily until a new leader is appointed but has ruled herself out of the contest.The other contenders for the Labour leadership include Mary Creagh, Liz Kendall and Yvette Cooper.In his column Lord Prescott added: ""Not New Labour or Old Labour.

2015-05-23,Apprenticeship system 'fails young',https://web.archive.org//web/20150524033726/http://www.bbc.com/news/education-32844164,"The apprenticeship system in Britain is ""failing"" and needs reform to address youth unemployment, a new report says. The study, commissioned by the Local Government Association, found 42% of all apprenticeships created in the last five years went to people aged over 25.It said current policy enabled businesses to train established workers rather than unemployed young people.The government said the number of young people not in work, education or training was at its lowest in a decade.It has pledged to create a further three million apprenticeships before the end of Parliament in 2020.   The report, by the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) and the Local Government Association (LGA), found 67% of intermediate-skilled apprentices were already employed by their company when they were given their apprenticeships. The study also said demand for apprenticeships - particularly among young people - had soared, with one million people applying for 85,000 vacancies last year.This was despite two million apprenticeships starting over the last Parliament, the report said. In 2013-14 under-19s applied for 57% of the advertised apprenticeships but were given 27% of them, whereas over-25s made up 7% of applications but filled 37% of the vacancies. The study's authors said the government needed to undertake ""significant reform"" of the apprenticeship system, which they said was ""failing to get to grips with stubbornly high levels of youth unemployment"".Luke Raikes, research fellow at IPPR North, said: ""A high quality apprenticeship system could be used to combat youth unemployment and drive higher productivity, but the system we currently have is failing to deliver.""There is a big gap between the function apprenticeships should have in our economy and how they're being used in practice: the majority of apprenticeships are being used to train older people, and those who are already employed at their company, instead of taking on young people out of work.""Just over a third of apprenticeships created in the last five years were at advanced or higher level, with the majority of places being at the intermediate level.And 24% of 16-18 year olds, and 15% of all intermediate apprentices were not being paid the minimum wage, the report said. Pay was particularly low in hairdressing and childcare, where 42% and 26% of apprentices were paid less than the minimum wage. The report said local apprenticeship hubs should be created and given full control of the apprenticeship grant from central government. This would enable employers to tailor the apprenticeship offer to better meet the needs of local employers and the local economy, it said.Powers and budgets for apprenticeships should also be further devolved to local authorities.   Cllr Peter Box, economy spokesman for the LGA, said: ""A good apprenticeship can give young people the experience, skills and understanding that can often lead straight into a full-time job. ""At present, too many new apprenticeships are low skilled and taken by older people already in work with their employer."""

First of all we'd ask why do we pay these people to react rather than pre-empt massive outcomes. Secondly it might have already been too late.  There might have been a huge sell-off in sterling. Government bonds - known as gilts - might have plunged in value, meaning the cost of borrowing for the Treasury might have soared overnight.Britain's major listed companies might have seen billions wiped off their value in early trading.Of course none of that might happen. Markets might have been very sanguine about quitting the EU. But we don't know and the only way the Bank of England would know was if it did some quiet preparatory work - outside the glare of publicity.That latter hope is now forlorn.The email, from Sir Jon Cunliffe's private secretary to four senior executives, was written on 21 May, the Guardian reported.James Talbot, the head of the monetary assessment and strategy division, was also involved in Project Bookend, the paper said.The email is quoted as saying: ""Jon's proposal, which he has asked me to highlight to you, is that no email is sent to James's team or more broadly around the Bank about the project.""James can tell his team that he is working on a short-term project on European economics in International [division] which will last a couple of months. This will be in-depth work on a broad range of European economic issues. Ideally he would then say no more.""The memo goes on to propose that questions from ""other parties"" about ""whether this was a project to look at the referendum"", should be given the answer, ""that there is a lot going on in Europe in the next couple of months - pointing to some of the specific European economic issues (eg: Greece) that would be of concern to the Bank"".A statement from the bank said: ""Today, information related to planned confidential Bank work on the potential implications of a renegotiation and national referendum on the UK's membership of the European Union made its way into the public domain, due to an internal email sent inadvertently to an external party.""There are a range of economic and financial issues that arise in the context of the renegotiation and national referendum.  It is one of the Bank's responsibilities to assess those that relate to its objectives.""It is not sensible to talk about this work publicly, in advance. But as with work done prior to the Scottish referendum, we will disclose the details of such work at the appropriate time.""While it is unfortunate that this information has entered the public domain in this way, the Bank will maintain this approach.""David Cameron is ready to start renegotiating the terms of Britain's EU membership ahead of a referendum. Here is some further reading on what it all means: The UK and the EU: Better off in or out?What Britain wants from EuropeQ&A: The UK's planned EU referendumTimeline: EU referendum debateWhy Germany is David Cameron's new best friendMr Leslie, who was appointed shadow chancellor after Ed Balls' election defeat, told the BBC the email raised questions about whether the report would be published, if so when, and whether businesses, the Treasury or the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) would be consulted and whether the chancellor knew about the assessment.Mark Taylor, a former IMF economist and researcher at the Bank of England, said the bank would have kept the project secret to avoid being pulled into the referendum debate politically and bias David Cameron's discussions as he renegotiates the terms of EU membership.Furthermore, if the UK does leave the union, a set of bilateral agreements would have to be negotiated so the bank would want to ""keep its cards close to its chest"", he added.He said the accidental email was ""a bit Dad's Army"", quite endearing but hadn't done any ""real damage"". Conservative former Cabinet minister Owen Paterson, a prominent eurosceptic, said the Bank's project should include the option of remaining in the European Economic Area without being a member of the EU.""If the Bank does look at those very optimistic options, that is thoroughly worthwhile and I hope they will make those investigations public,"" he told the Today programme.""It isn't either 'remain in the European Union or leap into the darkness'; there are other options,"" he added.BBC business correspondent Joe Lynam said the Bank of England would have kept the project secret to avoid becoming a political ""actor"" in the referendum.The bank had appeared to be ""slightly dragged into"" the debate ahead of the referendum on Scottish independence, he said.He added that there was no evidence that talk on Twitter of it being a deliberate leak was accurate.On Friday Mr Cameron met European counterparts for the first time since his general election victory, and admitted he was ""not met with a wall of love"" as he began diplomatic negotiations aimed at securing changes to the UK's relationship with Brussels.At a summit in Riga he conceded that securing a deal would take ""patience and tenacity"" and refused to ruled out campaigning for Britain to leave the EU if his renegotiation efforts failed."
2015-05-23,Cooper warns Labour of in-fighting,https://web.archive.org//web/20150524033726/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32858845,"Yvette Cooper has warned the Labour Party against swinging too far to the left or right as it seeks to elect a new leader after the election defeat.The leadership contender said it was wrong to think ""there needs to be blood on the floor"" for Labour to rise again.Writing in the Huffington Post she said the party needs urgent changes to win elections next year in London, Wales and Scotland. Ms Cooper is one of four candidates who have put their names forward so far. The others are Andy Burnham, Liz Kendall and Mary Creagh - candidates need the signatures of 35 MPs to make it onto the ballot paper.The BBC is to host a debate between candidates on 17 June ahead of a new leader being announced on 12 September.Ms Cooper wrote: ""The mountain we now have to climb is high. But there are some who mutter that we should give up.""That there needs to be blood on the floor for the Labour Party to rise again. That we should swing our party far to the right or far to the left, then fight it out from first principles all over again.""They believe we simply can't return to office in under a decade. They advocate, not a 2020 strategy, but a vague plan to win in 2025.""But that's no good for Labour, for Britain or for those who depend on progressive change. We can't fight and win by remaining a narrow party, we have to reach out.""Ed Miliband resigned as Labour leader after the Conservatives were elected as a majority government with 331 seats in the general election. Harriet Harman has been leading Labour temporarily until a new leader is appointed but has ruled herself out of the contest.  In the same article, Ms Cooper wrote that the party had to ""face some hard truths"" and acknowledge that it could not repeat mistakes made under Ed Miliband.She also said ""there is no comfort blanket for us either in Labour victories or Labour defeats of the past"" because ""the world has changed"".Ms Cooper added: ""Acerbic critiques and the rapid washing of hands won't make Labour win again. Nor will doing what we've done before but shouting that little bit louder.""We can't repeat the narrow approach of the last five years. But nor should we think the answer is to swallow the Tory manifesto instead.""Shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt said he would not stand for the party leadership because he had struggled to find the necessary backers and instead is backing Liz Kendall's campaign.Ms Cooper has said she wants the leader election to include ""as many people as possible"" and not be a ""closed-down or polarised contest""."

The Lib Dems said no more action would be taken after the incorrect suggestion that Nicola Sturgeon wanted David Cameron to remain as prime minister.Orkney and Shetland MP Mr Carmichael said it was an error of judgement.SNP deputy leader Stewart Hosie has said the party must be held to account.He also told the BBC he understood a complaint had already been made to the parliamentary standards commissioner.SNP leader Ms Sturgeon has called for Mr Carmichael to consider his position as an MP and described the leak of the confidential memo as a ""blatant election dirty trick"".He has since accepted ""the details of the account are not correct"" and accepted ""full responsibility for the publication"".A spokesman for the Liberal Democrats said: ""Alistair has taken responsibility and has given up £17,000. The party fully supports him as MP for Orkney and Shetland.""Mr Carmichael had been entitled to receive £17,000 severance pay after losing his Cabinet position. Speaking on BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme, Mr Hosie said: ""This is really quite outrageous, and a glib apology and an error of judgement simply aren't good enough.""How can the people of Orkney and Shetland trust him? I think they have the right to go to the polls again on what we now know.""Mr Hosie added: ""We understand there has already been a complaint raised with the parliamentary standards commissioner. I would hope that would be investigated fully.""He later said: ""Mr Carmichael has no credibility in continuing as an MP and in my opinion he should stand down. It is appropriate for the Standards Commissioner to get involved and arrive at her own conclusions, having investigated the full facts.""Protests have been held in Kirkwall, Orkney, and Lerwick, Shetland, calling for Mr Carmichael to resign.The confidential memo was published by the Daily Telegraph on 3 April as the general election campaign got under way.It was written by a civil servant in the Scotland Office and claimed Ms Sturgeon told the French Ambassador to the UK, Sylvie Bermann, that she would prefer Mr Cameron, the leader of the Conservatives, to remain as prime minister.The memo also claimed Ms Sturgeon said that Ed Miliband, who was then Labour's leader, was not prime minister material.The official cabinet office inquiry into the leaking of the memo said Mr Carmichael's former special adviser Euan Roddin gave the details to the Daily Telegraph - but he had Mr Carmichael's permission to do so.Mr Carmichael said, while he had not seen the document before it was published by the newspaper, he was ""aware of its content and agreed that my special adviser should make it public""."
2015-05-23,Macintosh supporters being 'bullied',https://web.archive.org//web/20150524033726/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32857281,"Scottish Labour MSP Ken Macintosh has told BBC Scotland the ""party machine"" is bullying his supporters in an attempt to avoid a leadership contest. Mr Macintosh and party deputy leader Kezia Dugdale have confirmed that they are standing for leadership of the party when Jim Murphy quits next month.The Eastwood MSP said his supporters were being ""bullied and intimidated"" into withdrawing their backing.Scottish Labour said the leadership contest would be conducted ""fairly"".A spokesman said Mr Macintosh had since withdrawn his allegations about the party. However, Mr Macintosh insisted his comments still stood but had not been aimed at party staff.He has not named those he thinks are responsible.Scottish Labour general secretary Brian Roy said: ""I have spoken to Ken Macintosh and he has withdrawn his allegations about the party. The leadership contest in Scotland will be conducted fairly and openly.""In response, Mr Macintosh said: ""I am not withdrawing anything. I clarified with Brian [Roy] that the allegations are not against party staff, but against the machine politics which have too much influence in the Labour Party.""Mr Macintosh, the party's social justice spokesman, ran for party leadership against Johann Lamont almost four years ago and is likely to need nominations from six or seven MSPs to be a candidate in this leadership contest. Ms Dugdale, who is widely regarded as the ""obvious person"" to take on the job, confirmed her leadership bid on Friday.But he claims his backers are coming under ""incredible pressure to withdraw their support"".""I want to have a contest but I've found the whole weight of the party machine yet again turning against me trying to close down a contest,"" he told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme. ""All the people that have been trying to support me, the party machine has turned on them, and they are being put under incredible pressure to withdraw their support. They are being bullied and being intimidated and pressurised not to support me so we don't have a contest.""I wouldn't even have put my head above the parapet if I didn't know I had that support.""Mr Macintosh, who won a majority of member votes in the last leadership contest, said the three-college system used by the Labour Party to elect leaders was ""ridiculous"". ""I want the members to take control of the party,"" he said. ""We need to move to one member, one vote.""He called for a quick contest, before the summer if possible, that is ""fair and democratic"".By BBC Scotland political correspondent Glenn CampbellKezia Dugdale already has the backing of twenty Labour MSPs for her bid to become Scottish party leader. That's more than half the Labour team at Holyrood. Many of them would like her elected unopposed. Yet when she announced her intention to stand, Ms Dugdale said she would ""absolutely"" welcome a contest. Ken MacIntosh is offering that challenge. He is likely to require the support of six or seven MSPs to become a candidate. But he claims his supporters are being ""bullied and intimidated"" by what he calls the ""party machine"" in an attempt to avoid a contest. He has not been more specific. There are certainly those who think a coronation would save time and political energy and allow Labour to concentrate on the 2016 Holyrood election campaign. Others argue that a contest would allow a fuller debate about Labour's problems and possible solutions and give the new leader more authority to pursue reform. Mr Macintosh said he would campaign on fairness and social justice across the whole of Scotland with an emphasis on lifelong learning, housing and renewable energy.""The reason I think it is important that I put my views forward is I think that is all about restoring trust in the Labour Party,"" he said. ""At the last election people could not bring themselves to put their trust in Labour. I can't believe that after all these years and what we stand for.""Mr Macintosh said restoring the Scottish Labour Party required integrity, principles and honesty and ""moving away from machine politics and guile and the idea it's about power and position"".""I'm in politics to make other people's lives better, whether I'm leader or not leader, whether I'm MSP or not MSP. I am a conviction politician,"" he said.He said problems with the ""party machine"" were about ""people who want power and position and influence"", which was an ""issue for all politicians"". ""We have to remember our principles and if we can't do that we can't restore confidence in the Labour Party,"" Mr Macintosh added.Former East Renfrewshire MP Mr Murphy announced that he would resign next month after Labour's crushing general election defeat at the hands of the SNP. Ms Dugdale, the Lothian region MSP, said she welcomed a leadership contest. She has won the backing of more than half of Scottish Labour's MSPs and MP Ian Murray since announcing her intention to stand on Friday. ""I am proud to have already won the support of so many Labour colleagues in the Scottish Parliament,"" Ms Dugdale said.""The geographical spread of support I have - with MSPs from north and south, east and west - as well as the backing of MSPs from different parts of our movement shows I can bring our party together."""
2015-05-23,Balls 'not dashing back to politics',https://web.archive.org//web/20150524033726/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32852568,"Ed Balls has told the BBC he will not be ""dashing back"" to frontline politics after losing his seat at the election.He said he had wanted Labour's campaign to be more ""pro-business"" but he had backed Ed Miliband ""100%"" and he shared responsibility for the party's defeat.""In the end he didn't persuade people he could be the prime minister but I didn't persuade people I could be the chancellor either,"" said Mr Balls.He was speaking exclusively to BBC political editor Nick Robinson.In his first interview since election night, the former shadow chancellor spoke of his ""sense of loss"" at Labour' defeat and described losing his seat two weeks ago as ""a symbol of the vibrancy of our democracy"".He said: ""I always knew if the Tories won a majority I was probably a goner, but the reason I travelled 7,500 miles and went to 45 seats was because I was fighting to win."" He added: ""Politics is a brutal business,"" because ""it was a real possibility"" his party might win, and he might become chancellor.Commenting on the campaign, he said: 'I think I wanted to be more pro-business but I also backed Ed Miliband 100%. ""He was the leader I was the shadow chancellor we both worked very hard and in the end neither he or I persuaded people and we need to take our responsibility for that. It's not all on him it's on all of us.""Were you up for that Ed Balls moment - the symbol of Labour's crushing electoral defeat, the trigger for wild Tory celebrations and Labour despair?Ed Balls was in reflective mood when we spoke - looking back at what he'd achieved as much as forward to what might be next.For the rest of Nick's article and a full transcript of the interview, click here.In one of the shock results of election night, the former shadow chancellor lost his Morley and Outwood seat in West Yorkshire by 422 votes to Conservative Andrea Jenkyns.He had previously had a majority of 1,101 in the constituency on the outskirts of Leeds.Asked by Nick Robinson if he was one of the reasons Labour was unelectable, Mr Balls replied: ""Of course. ""I mean Ed Miliband said straight after the election he took responsibility but all of us have to bear our share of responsibility. ""Ed was the leader I backed him as shadow chancellor 100%. In the end he didn't persuade people he could  be the prime minister but I didn't persuade people I could be the chancellor either. I have to take that on the chin. ""People will analyse for weeks and months what happened and that's something that still feels too early for me."" Speaking about his own future, Mr Balls said: ""I'm not going to be dashing back"" to frontline politics but ""never say never"". He was, he said, embarking on ""a new chapter, outside of politics. No by-elections, not back in parliament, that is how it feels at the moment. Outside of politics is where I am going next."" He says his wife Yvette Cooper, who is running to be Labour leader, is ""brilliant and people will get a chance to see what she stands for"" but he insisted that ""I am not playing a role in her campaign"" except ""whilst she is busy I can do more to help family"".  Asked whether whether he worries that she is applying for the toughest job in British politics he said: ""You have to take your calling when it comes."" Mr Balls did not rule out appearing on Strictly Come Dancing - a prospect his wife has described as ""truly terrifying"" - but he told Nick Robinson that despite running three marathons ""I'm not sure if I'm equipped for Strictly."" He said he'd be spending his time ""cooking, running, playing the piano"" and using ""real time to stand back and think"" to write about economics.  He reflected, finally, on his image - and how he was perceived by the electorate:  ""It is very hard in politics for people to see the real you. You are seen through the prism your opponents set up.""Mr Balls' demise spelled the end of a decade in Parliament which has seen him at the heart of the Labour machine.He held the position of chief economic adviser to the Treasury in the Blair government from 1997, working on policies including Sure Start, tax credits and the national minimum wage.Ed Balls first became an MP in 2005 and a year later was made Economic Secretary to the Treasury.He was a close adviser to then-chancellor Gordon Brown and earned a reputation as a political bruiser."

Speaking at an EU summit in Latvia, he said he had not been greeted ""by a wall of love"" when he met EU leaders for the first time since his election win.But he said he had a mandate and the ""British people at his back"" for the changes he wanted to achieve.The prime minister will hold talks with Angela Merkel and EU Commission boss Jean-Claude Juncker next week.Mr Cameron will also meet French President Francois Hollande as he tries to win support for his position.Other EU countries have said they will listen to what the UK has to say, the Finnish prime minister Alexander Stubb saying he backed the UK's proposals to cut red tape and was sure ""some kind of compromise"" could be reached. But some member states have questioned the need for any change to EU treaties, something Mr Cameron has said he wants to see, and ruled out any watering down of the key principle of freedom of movement. Speaking at a meeting of EU leaders, Mr Cameron said he believed it was in the interests of both the UK and its European partners for the UK to remain part of the European Union but under different terms.The British people, he said, were not happy with the status quo and wanted change on issues such as welfare, immigration and an opt-out from further integration.Mr Cameron said he had only begun to ""scratch the surface"" of the discussions but would travel to Berlin and Paris next week as well as hosting European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker at his country residence, Chequers, on Monday.He said the British people needed ""the best possible choice"" about the UK's future in Europe and did not rule out bringing forward his promised referendum, currently scheduled to take place by the end of 2017. Mr Cameron said he expected ""lots of ups and downs"" in the process and reminding journalists that many of their pre-election forecasts were wrong, he urged them to ""wait for the result"".""I do not expect to find agreed solutions straight away,"" he told them.""These talks will require patience and tenacity. But by working together in the right spirit and sticking at it, I believe we can reform the EU and our relationship with it. And then the British people will have the final say. They will decide.""The changes he was seeking were ""deliverable and doable"", he insisted.""I've set out a series of changes which I think address the main concerns that British people have, that I have, about Europe and the way it works. And I'm confident of getting those changes.""British officials said the process was at a very early stage, but the meetings with Mrs Merkel, regarded as Germany's most powerful leader and Mr Juncker, the most senior official in Brussels, will be seen as key to setting the tone for future discussions. Mr Cameron is committed to holding an in/out referendum on Britain's membership of the EU by the end of 2017, but there is speculation it could be held next year to avoid a clash with elections in France and Germany.Legislation paving the way for the UK referendum is expected to be published next Thursday, the day after the Queen opens Parliament.Asked whether he would be prepared to recommend a UK exit if he did not get the outcome he wanted, Mr Cameron said he would ""not rule anything out"". David Cameron is ready to start renegotiating the terms of Britain's EU membership ahead of a referendum. Here is some further reading on what it all means: The UK and the EU: Better off in or out?What Britain wants from EuropeQ&A: The UK's planned EU referendumTimeline: EU referendum debateWhy Germany is David Cameron's new best friendBBC deputy political editor James Landale said Mr Cameron had used the summit, arranged to discuss the EU's relationship with Russia and its neighbours, to sound out other European leaders about what they might be willing to accept before the start of ""intricate"" negotiations in the coming months.Other EU leaders, he added, were ""scared witless"" by the possibility of the UK leaving the EU and were willing to listen and consider a deal, but there were some things - such as changes to freedom of movement rules - which were ""sacrosanct"".Mr Cameron has not revealed the full details of what he is seeking from any changes, but he is expected to demand an opt-out from one its core principles of forging an ""ever-closer union"" between member states. He will also try to get more powers to block or opt out of new EU laws, and for restrictions on welfare benefits for migrants until they have lived in the UK for four years.This week, a number of UK business leaders started to highlight the potential implications of the referendum, with the president of the CBI saying businesses should ""speak out early"" in favour of remaining in a reformed EU,The Labour Party, SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems are in favour of staying in the EU. UKIP, which got almost four million votes but only one MP in the election, want to leave."

And who is vying for the deputy leader job?Shadow health minister Liz Kendall was the first Labour MP to say they wanted a crack at the party's top job, saying a ""fundamentally new approach"" was needed.First elected to Parliament in 2010 as MP for Leicester West and appointed to the shadow front bench the same year, Ms Kendall is seen as a Blairite contender.She is a former special adviser to Harriet Harman and then Health Secretary Patricia Hewitt who has argued for reform of public services.In an interview for The House magazine in January, she said there ""will remain a role"" for private and voluntary firms in the health service, ""where they can add extra capacity to the NHS or challenge to the system"".Could she be a fresh face to lead a change of direction for Labour, or seen as too inside the Westminster bubble?The Labour MP for Leigh since 2001, Andy Burnham has plenty of government experience and is the current bookies' favourite.Mr Burnham served as health secretary under Gordon Brown and previously as culture secretary and chief secretary to the Treasury.He stood for the leadership in 2010 but lost out to Ed Miliband, going on to hold the shadow health brief under Mr Miliband's leadership. He is said to have strong trade union support.Declaring his intention to stand, he said Labour must support the ""aspirations of everyone"".Another former chief secretary to the Treasury - as well as a work and pensions minister under Gordon Brown - Yvette Cooper has been shadow home secretary for the past four years.A strong Commons performer, she has given Home Secretary Theresa May a hard time over matters including passport delays, border controls and extremism.She did not stand to succeed Mr Brown in 2010, in favour of her husband, Ed Balls.Announcing her bid this time around, she said: ""Our promise of hope wasn't strong enough to drown out the Tory and UKIP voices of fear. That's what we need to change.""The shadow international development secretary has announced her intention to join the race for the Labour leadership, via an article in the Daily MailMs Creagh joined parliament in 2005 as the MP for Wakefield, gaining experience in government as an assistant whip in 2009-10.She's also held various shadow cabinet positions in opposition, most notably as shadow secretary of state for environment, food and rural affairs - and transport.Ms Creagh held onto her brief as international development secretary in acting Labour leader Harriet Harman's recent reshuffle of the shadow cabinet.The MP for Don Valley has been Labour's shadow energy and climate change secretary since 2011, after a stint heading up the Department for Communities and Local Government.Ms Flint held on to her current position in the latest shadow cabinet reshuffle.She also held various ministerial positions during Gordon Brown's premiership, but famously resigned from as Europe minister after accusing him of treating her and her female colleagues as ""window dressing"".A former GMTV presenter, Gloria de Piero joined Parliament as the MP for Ashfield in 2010.She immediately rose to shadow ministerial ranks, taking on a culture, media and sport brief and then home affairs.Since 2013 she's been a shadow minister for women and equalities, being one of Harriet Harman's team on Labour's woman-to-woman ""pink bus"" campaign.The MP for West Bromwich since 2001. He has made a name for himself as a prominent backbench campaigner against phone hacking and child sex abuse.He also played a minor role in the toppling of Tony Blair after resigning as a defence minister and calling for the-then PM to quit in the interest of party and country.Watson became Labour's campaign chief under Ed Miliband but he quit after a he became embroiled in a row about the role of the Unite union in the candidate selection in Falkirk.Setting out his pitch for the job, he said: ""I'm seeking the deputy leadership to do one thing: write and execute the election battle plan so that our new leader will be prime minister.""The Walthamstow MP has a growing reputation as a hard-working campaigning MP. Another from the 2010 intake, she was praised for campaign against payday loans companies, and has a strong following on social media.She told the Sunday Mirror: ""Too many voters think Labour is no longer a movement for social justice but a machine that only kicks in to gear at election time.""Shadow environment secretary Angela Eagle plans to travel the country to speak to people who did the ""hard graft"" in the election campaign.The MP for Wallasey said Labour could not be ""complacent"" if it was to reverse its general election defeat.Ms Eagle, an MP since 1992, held a number of ministerial jobs during the last Labour government and in 2013 became chair of the Labour Party.She is arguably best-known for having a twin sister, Maria, who is also a Labour MP.A former journalist and Labour cabinet minister, Ben Bradshaw has been the MP for Exeter since 1997.He plans a ""big tent"" approach to ensure Labour does not miss out on votes in the south of England, saying the party has to ""broaden its appeal"".Reflecting on who should replace Ed Miliband, he said: ""I would prefer to see one of the new generation come forward rather than someone associated with the Blair and Brown era.""If we really want to win in 2020 - and I think we need to for the country's sake -  I would like to see someone from the new generation without that baggage from the past.""The MP for Tottenham was the first person to publicly weigh up a leadership bid, telling the BBC that he would consider standing if colleagues wanted him to.But he's ruled himself out of the top job, saying his principal aim is to become Labour's candidate for Mayor of London in 2016.""I think we need a leader that can win back the Midlands understand Scotland as well as the south.""Actually we need to do better in London, my strengths are in London and the south therefore I want to be the Labour candidate for Mayor,"" he told the BBC's Daily Politics programme.One of the most prominent black MPs in the party, the former former barrister is regarded as being on the right of the party, having served as a minister under both Tony Blair and Gordon Brown.His national profile rose during the 2011 riots in London, when he appealed for calm and reconciliation in the wake of the fatal shooting of Mark Duggan in his north London constituency. Dame Tessa Jowell was a key figure at the heart of New Labour - she once said she would ""jump under a bus"" for Tony Blair.The former Dulwich and West Norwood MP, who stood down at the general election after 20 years in Parliament, earned widespread plaudits for the role she played in London's bid for the 2012 Olympics and her subsequent performance as Olympics minister.She has vowed to bring ""Olympic-like discipline"" to changing London, promising to build more affordable homes.The former culture secretary, who was a psychiatric social worker before entering politics, is seen as one of the frontrunners in the race to be Labour's mayoral candidate, with one poll suggesting she is backed by 40% of Labour supporters.Sadiq Khan launched his bid to be London mayor with an attack on incumbent Boris Johnson, describing him as a ""red carpet mayor, somebody who is fantastic going to openings, great with a flute of champagne in his hands"".""I'd rather roll up my sleeves and fight for all Londoners,"" he added.The son of a bus driver, Mr Khan worked as a human rights solicitor before becoming an MP in 2005. He is shadow London minister.A close ally of former Labour leader Ed Miliband, Mr Khan served in junior ministerial roles in Gordon Brown's government.A familiar face to viewers of BBC One's This Week, Diane Abbott is a veteran left winger who first entered the Commons in 1987, as one of Britain's first black MPs.The Hackney North and Stoke Newington MP was shadow public health spokesman under Ed Miliband, after losing out to him in the 2010 Labour leadership contest.Launching her mayoral bid, she said she would bring London's communities together and be the ""genuinely independently minded Mayor that London needs"".""Hard times call for a campaigning Mayor. Now more than ever our city needs a Mayor who will stand up for the interests of those increasingly left behind,"" she added.A journalist and railway historian, Christian Wolmar is one of Britain's most in-demand transport pundits.The only non-politician in the race, he campaigns against the construction of HS2 and has vowed to tackle London's ""housing crisis"", improve the transport network and revitalise public spaces.""Instead of partisan and personality politics London needs a dedicated, ideas driven mayor who works for Londoners and their needs,"" he said.The 65-year-old cycles to campaign meeting and claims to have clocked up more than 2,000 miles already.Chuka Umunna was the second candidate to declare he would stand for election as leader of the Labour Party.A rising star of the party, Mr Umunna was first elected to Parliament in 2010 and appointed shadow business secretary the following year.He has retained the seat of Streatham with a majority of nearly 14,000 and a vastly increased vote share this time round.He announced his intention to stand via a post on his Facebook page. He said he had spoken to half the Labour 80 candidates standing in Tory seats targeted by the party and other MPs before making his announcement. However, three days later Mr Umunna withdrew from the leadership contest. He said in a statement posted on his Twitter feed that had been uncomfortable with the level of ""sheer pressure"" and scrutiny that came with being a candidate.The 36-year-old added that it had perhaps been ""too soon"" for him to launch a leadership bid.Another rising star of the 2010 intake, the MP for Leeds West was appointed shadow chief secretary to the Treasury in 2011 and shadow work and pensions secretary in 2013.During the election campaign, she attacked the so-called bedroom tax, whereby housing benefit payments are reduced for tenants in council and social housing deemed to have spare rooms.However, she also suggested Labour would consider reducing the overall welfare cap in some areas.She told BBC News Labour needs ""to be in the centre ground to win a general election"" but ruled herself out of a leadership bid.A former home secretary and shadow chancellor, Alan Johnson is the Labour leadership candidate who never quite was.The popular MP declined to stand in 2010 and stepped down from his shadow cabinet role in 2011 for personal reasons.Earlier this year it was reported that senior New Labour figures Lord Mandelson and Alistair Campbell approached Mr Johnson over a leadership bid, although all three later distanced themselves from the story.But the former postman, who has been MP for Hull West and Hessle since 1997, had seemingly ruled himself out again, saying it is a ""10-year job"" and he does not have the ""right qualities"". Former army officer Dan Jarvis was elected MP for Barnsley Central in a by-election in 2011, having resigned his commission as a major in the Parachute Regiment to contest the seat.He held onto his seat at the general election, taking time out from campaigning to run the London Marathon last month.After entering Parliament in 2010, he quickly became a shadow culture, media and sport minister and later a shadow justice minister.In 2011, Mr Jarvis became the first serving politician in more than 60 years to be awarded a military honour, when he was made an MBE for his services to the armed forces.He has been touted by some colleagues as a future Labour leader but Mr Jarvis, who was widowed in 2010 and has a young family, ruled himself out, saying it is not the ""right time"" for him and his family. Historian and journalist Tristram Hunt entered Parliament in 2010 as Labour MP for Stoke-on-Trent Central.Ed Miliband made him shadow education secretary in 2013 and he has been a fierce critic of the coalition's education policies in England.Speaking in the aftermath of the election results, he called on Labour's ruling National Executive Committee ""not to rush our election"", saying there was time for a ""brutal post-mortem"" about Labour's ""underlying philosophy and thinking"".As for his own ambitions, he said ""it's about the lyrics as much as the lead singer I think"".He later said he was not confident of getting enough nominations to stand, and would support Liz Kendall.The MP for Rochdale says the deputy leader vacancy has ""come a bit too soon"" for him.He previously said a number of colleagues had asked him to put his name forward for the role.Mr Danczuk is well known for his prominent campaigning against child sex abuse and leading calls for an inquiry into allegations of historical child sex abuse by senior figures at Westminster.He was a vocal critic of Ed Miliband and in an article for the Daily Telegraph on Thursday he said Labour needed to ""step out if its Metropolitan comfort zone"" and ""reach out to the country once more.""The former director of public prosecutions has only just become an MP after being elected in Frank Dobson's old seat of Holborn and St Pancras, in North London at the general election.He was forced to rule himself out of the race to be Labour leader following a social media campaign urging him to stand.He said he was ""flattered"" by the campaign but the party needed someone with ""more political experience"".The older brother of ex-leader Ed, David Miliband was frontrunner to replace Gordon Brown in 2010, until his sibling beat him by a whisker.A former foreign secretary and MP for South Shields, he was the Blairite choice for leader but eventually quit Parliament to become head of the International Rescue Committee charity in New York in 2013.Speaking to the BBC from the US on the Monday after the general election, Mr Miliband criticised his brother's campaign in the 2015 general election, saying he and Mr Brown had ""allowed themselves to be portrayed as moving backwards from the principles of aspiration and inclusion that are the absolute heart of any successful progressive political project"".While he acknowledged the two men were ""brothers for life"", he also confirmed he was not eligible to stand for the party leadership as he is not an MP.Labour's election rulesMPs wishing to stand as leader and deputy leader have to be nominated by 15% of their colleagues in the Parliamentary Labour Party to be eligible to stand.As Labour now has 232 MPs, this means prospective candidates must get at least 34 signatures. That means the maximum size of any field is six contenders.Under rules agreed last year, all Labour Party members, registered supporters and affiliated supporters - including union members - will be allowed a maximum of one vote each on a one member, one vote system. When the election is held, they will be asked to rank candidates in order of preference.If no candidate gets 50% of all votes cast, the votes will be added up and the candidate with the fewest votes eliminated. Their 2nd preference votes will then be redistributed until one candidate has 50% of all votes cast."
2015-05-23,What Britain wants from Europe,https://web.archive.org//web/20150524033726/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32695399,"David Cameron says he has a mandate to pursue EU reform following the Conservatives' general election victory. The PM, who will be hoping his majority government will give him extra leverage in Brussels, wants to renegotiate the terms of the UK's membership ahead of a referendum by the end of 2017. He has said he will campaign for Britain to remain in the EU if he gets the reforms he wants.Mr Cameron has said he does not want to reveal full details of his negotiating hand but he has given a broad indication, in a series of speeches and newspaper articles, of his priorities when he goes into talks with other EU leaders.These are: The prime minister has said Britain would resist any move towards a European Army and that he wants to free British police forces from EU interference. He has also ruled out Britain joining the euro.But he has placed less emphasis in recent years on demanding changes to EU social policy, such as the maximum 48-hour working week, agency workers, maternity leave and non-discrimination rules.The official UK government position is that a referendum will be held by the end of 2017 but Downing Street sources have said: ""If we can do it earlier we will.""There is speculation David Cameron is planning to hold the vote in 2016 to avoid a clash with French and German elections in 2017.The prime minister wants treaty change but even if the referendum was held in 2017 there may not be enough time to legally incorporate any reforms into a treaty and it would have to be done at a later stage.An early referendum would anger Eurosceptics who believe it would not allow enough time to make the case for exit or negotiate any meaningful concessions.""A rushed process would severely undermine the chances to secure a significant deal that both British business and voters could support and would waste the opportunity of a lifetime,"" Matthew Elliott, chief executive of Business for Britain told Breitbart London.The question is always crucial in any referendum and there is already a debate about what it should be. The Draft European Union (Referendum) Bill, published by the Conservatives in 2013, proposed this form of words: ""Do you think that the United Kingdom should remain a member of the European Union?""Some thought that leaned too far towards the status quo, encouraging a yes vote, and the Electoral Commission said it was not clear and direct enough. The watchdog proposed this form of words instead: ""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union?""The new Conservative government will attempt to repeal the Human Rights Act, which requires UK courts to treat the European Court of Human Rights as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. The European Court of Human Rights is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe (CoE), which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine.The freedom for people to move around Europe, enshrined in the EU treaties, works in parallel with the other three basic freedoms in the single market: freedom of goods, capital and services.It is likely to be a ""red line"" for other EU leaders, who do not want to see it eroded.Mr Cameron has steered clear of tackling it directly - for example by asking for an emergency ""brake"" on free movement, or a cap on numbers - focusing instead on reducing the incentive provided by welfare payments. In a speech last November, David Cameron set out measures to reduce the number of EU nationals moving to the UK.His main proposals were:Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission, has said he is ready to work with Mr Cameron to ""strike a fair deal for the United Kingdom in the EU"". The leaders of other EU nations have previously warned they are unlikely to support major changes to EU treaties to accommodate British demands. But Mr Cameron's general election victory may have given him extra leverage. ""The ball is very much in the court of the UK now,"" a senior EU official told The Guardian. ""It's up to the British to define what they want."" The key figure will be German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is very keen to keep Britain in the EU but has so far been unwilling to make major concessions to enable that to happen. There are fears that a ""pick and mix"" approach to EU treaties would undermine EU cohesion.Mr Cameron has said there is ""no doubt"" his planned reforms will require changes to the treaties governing the European Union. But this would require the unanimous support of all EU members, and may not be possible within the deadline he has set of a referendum before the end of 2017. Any attempt to change EU laws on free movement would meet fierce resistance from some EU nations, particularly Eastern European states. Mr Juncker has said free movement is non-negotiable.Mr Cameron may find it difficult to get unanimous support for his proposals for a four-year waiting period for migrant workers claiming UK benefits. East European EU members would be likely to oppose this, on the grounds that it would discriminate against their citizens.  Attempts to secure opt-outs for the City are unlikely to go down well with other European leaders.However, there are precedents for EU treaty changes to accommodate some countries' specific concerns - for example, the protocol attached to the Lisbon Treaty for Ireland.Mr Cameron has faced repeated calls to say whether he would campaign for Britain's exit from the EU in the referendum if he fails to get what he wants from the renegotiation process. All he has said is that he will ""rule nothing out"". Some Conservative MPs want Britain to leave the EU no matter what David Cameron manages to renegotiate. A larger group are likely to want more concessions than Mr Cameron has so far indicated he is prepared to demand.Senior backbencher David Davis, who was defeated by Mr Cameron for the Tory leadership in 2005, told the Daily Telegraph the majority of the 332 Conservative MPs want Mr Cameron to negotiate an ""opt-out"" power to stop individual EU laws from applying to Britain. The prime minister has said this would be ""impossible"" without Britain leaving the EU.Mr Davis claims as many as 60 Tory MPs would be prepared to rebel and vote for Britain's exit from the EU if the prime minister fails to deliver.Graham Brady, chairman of the Tory backbench 1922 committee, which represents backbenchers, has urged David Cameron to give all Conservative MPs, including ministers, a free vote in the EU referendum.In January, Mr Cameron warned that serving cabinet ministers would have to quit the government if they wanted to campaign to leave the EU if he had secured the reforms to it he wants.In the 1975 referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Economic Community, as the EU was then called, Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson decided to suspend collective responsibility because his cabinet was split on the issue. Ministers were allowed to vote with their consciences and campaign against each other. The majority of them, including Mr Wilson, joined the Yes camp, but left-wingers, such as Tony Benn, played a leading role in the No campaign. The Yes campaign won easily with 67% of the vote."

That is the question many people will be asking after the party which has fought for Scottish independence for 80 years swept to victory. The answer from the jubilant Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon is a firm ""no"". She insists that her MPs will speak for all of Scotland, not just for the 45% who voted for the country to leave the United Kingdom last September. 'This changes nothing,' Norman Smith, assistant political editor: ""This has been an election which may have more profound consequences than almost any in living memory. ""We now face a generational decision about our future in Europe, with an EU referendum in two years time almost certain. There will also be serious questions about the future of the Union, following an SNP landslide that has turned Scotland into a virtual one-party state. David Cameron's victory also represents a colossal achievement.""James Landale, deputy political editor: ""After an extraordinary night, some brief conclusions: With a small majority or slight minority for David Cameron, Tory MPs will be much empowered. As such, Mr Cameron will need support from other parties to get business through. The PM will also need a better whips office to handle rebellions.""Laura Kuenssberg, chief correspondent, Newsnight: ""For Labour the story of their terrible night is rapidly turning into the search for a new leader. So who will that be? Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, is almost certain to run. Even before this election, both he and another almost inevitable candidate, Chuka Umunna, had raised eyebrows inside the party at the work they had put in, preparing the ground with members and the unions for potential bids.""Robert Peston, economics editor: ""Sterling is up (the most for seven years against the euro), share prices are up (especially bank shares like Lloyds and RBS, and energy shares such as Centrica), government bond prices are up.

As a child I spent many family holidays on the Isles of Scilly, 28 miles off the Cornish coast. We'd spend our time walking, cycling and, best of all, rock-pooling.  But where we would normally expect to catch a few shrimps and the odd crab, there was one memorable year when we pulled the Leader of Her Majesty's Opposition out of the water.  It was 10 August 1973 and we were enjoying a bike ride around the largest island, St Mary's. I was with my parents, my elder brother Simon, 16, then a pupil at Rugby School, his best friend Robert, and my younger brother, Matthew, who was 10.  As we cycled along a path above an isolated bay, Matthew spotted an empty rubber dinghy racing out to the open sea. As we watched it speed towards the horizon we wondered whose it was and why it was loose.  Suddenly my father said that he thought he'd heard a cry. Sure enough, above the buffeting of the wind we could just make out a distressed male voice. My father cupped his hands and shouted: ""What is your trouble?""  ""I can't get into my boat,"" the voice answered. ""Fetch a dinghy!""  We pedalled down to the bay as fast as we could.  My father yelled: ""We'll get to you in a few minutes. Can you hold on?""  ""Yes - for a bit,"" came the faint reply. While Robert sped off to alert the Coastguard, Simon found a dinghy - but it had no oars. My father hurriedly looked around for a pair but then, further off, saw a wooden ""pram"" dinghy, its oars still in its rowlocks.  He and Simon carried this to the water's edge and, with Simon guiding him, my father rowed out towards a group of motor launches moored about 300 yards from the shore. While they did this my mother, Matthew and I waited on the beach, which was deserted except for a benign looking Labrador chained up by a fisherman's hut.  The dog's name tag said ""Paddy"" and Matthew and I stroked his ears while we anxiously waited for events to unfold.   Twenty minutes later we saw my father and Simon coming back. Hunched between them in the boat was a bedraggled looking, but familiar figure.  ""It's Harold Wilson,"" I said.  As my father rowed towards the quay, the Labour leader suddenly stood up, nearly swamping the boat. He then sat down again until it had docked, and Simon helped him onto dry land.  I vividly recall how shocked he looked. His shorts and shirt were drenched, his hair was plastered to his scalp, his teeth were chattering and his face was white.  He declined my father's offer of further help, including the loan of a bike to get back to his bungalow, but said that he was glad that we'd come along when we did.  My father jovially responded that it wasn't every day one pulled a former prime minister out of the water and that we were happy to have been able to help.  Satisfied that Wilson was all right, we left him with Paddy and cycled away.  As we ate our picnic lunch my father and Simon explained that Wilson had slipped into the sea while attempting to step from his rubber dinghy onto his motor launch.  The dinghy had shot away from him - the dinghy that we'd seen.  Unable to pull himself into the boat, Wilson had been left hanging on to the fender ropes for dear life. He'd told them that he'd been feeling sea-sick and that his arms felt ""numb"" and were ""giving out"".  Simon had stepped on to Wilson's boat and had then hauled the man on to the deck ""like a sack of potatoes"".  Dad then swore us all to secrecy - if the story got out it could ruin the opposition leader's holiday, and our own.  The next morning we went down to Porthcressa and by chance we saw Wilson coming off the beach.   I remember thinking that he'd be happy to see us again - perhaps he'd even ask us to tea? To my surprise I saw a flash of irritation cross his face.   My father greeted him and asked how he was.  He replied that he felt all right, if rather stiff, and that he had spent the rest of the day in bed.  ""I've had my swim for the holiday though,"" he added pleasantly, then he went on his way and we didn't see him again.  Returning home after the holiday we told no-one what had happened but somehow, a month later, the story got out.  First my father was approached by our local paper which made the story a splash: ""Rugby Family Rescues Mr. Wilson From Sea."" This got picked up by the Birmingham Post and within 48 hours my father's face was on the front of every national newspaper.  Headlines such as ""Wilson Snatched From Drowning"" and ""Wilson Rescued in Sea Drama"" amused us, but we were outraged by the Daily Mirror's ""My Dog Tipped me In!""  In a piece of Labour spin, Wilson's press secretary, Joe Haines, had apparently blamed the labrador.  There was even a photo of ""the culprit"", Paddy, who was ""in the doghouse"".  One could see the need for damage limitation - the incident was extremely embarrassing for Wilson, not least because the Prime Minister Ted Heath was a world-class yachtsman. There were cartoons of Heath grinning at the news on board his yacht, Morning Cloud.  My father, a nuclear engineer, was besieged at work by TV film crews and quizzed about his voting habits. ""Lifelong Tory Saves Wilson from Drowning"", announced the Daily Telegraph.  The Times pointed out that the Labour Leader, whose party had pledged to end private education, had been rescued by a public schoolboy.  And so it went on. We put up with myriad jokes of the ""Why didn't you throw him back?"" variety.  In the meantime Haines continued to elaborate on the story.  Wilson, he claimed in the Mirror, was in ""no danger"".  He ""could have swum to the beach"" but was ""waiting for a friend"".  The truth is, Harold Wilson would have died.  Aged 57, he'd been in the cold water, never more than 15C on Scilly, for more than half an hour.  Knowing the strong Atlantic currents, he hadn't dared risk the long swim back to the beach.  Worst of all, in that deserted spot, there had been no-one to hear his cries.   Reflecting on the incident afterwards, my father told us that Wilson seemed not to understand that it was ""only by the slenderest margins"" that his life had been saved.  Six months later, in February 1974, Harold Wilson became prime minister again.It's now 42 years since ""The Wilson Affair"" as my family always called it.  It seems strange that despite all the publicity this very significant event in the life of Wilson is almost unknown.  Neither of his official biographers, Ben Pimlott and Philip Ziegler, mentioned it in their respective books, nor did Joe Haines revisit it in his own memoir of Wilson, Glimmers of Twilight.  I sometimes wondered how Wilson's colleagues had viewed the story at the time. Were they sympathetic? Amused?  Did they pull his leg about it?  ""Oh I remember it well,"" Denis Healey told me when I phoned him in the House of Lords a few months ago. ""Harold seemed very embarrassed by it and was clearly anxious to play the whole thing down.  We didn't feel that we could mention it to him - definitely not.""  And if my family hadn't happened to pass by when we did?  It's fair to say that the course of British politics might have been rather different.  Denis Healey or Jim Callaghan might have succeeded Wilson. Edward Heath might not have been defeated in 1974 and there might well have been no Tory leadership challenge the following year and therefore, quite possibly, no Thatcher premiership.  My late brother, Simon, used to wonder whether our father may, on that fateful August day, have inadvertently launched Margaret  Thatcher's prime ministerial career.

2015-05-23,Out or in?,https://web.archive.org//web/20150524033726/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32793642,"David Cameron has promised a referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Union by the end of 2017. Here is a summary of the key arguments for and against British membership.If Britain votes to leave the EU, it will have to negotiate a new trading relationship with what would now be a 27 member organisation, to allow British firms to sell goods and services to EU countries without being hit by excessive tariffs and other restrictions.Better off out: Britain could negotiate an ""amicable divorce"", but retain strong trading links with EU nations, say those campaigning for Britain's exit. There are several potential scenarios:Better off in: An ""amicable divorce"" is a pipe dream, pro-EU campaigners argue. France, Germany and other leading EU nations would never allow Britain a ""pick and mix"" approach to the bloc's rules. Norway and Switzerland have to abide by many EU rules without any influence over how they are formed. Negotiating a comprehensive free trade agreement could take years and have an uncertain outcome. And if Britain went for a completely clean break with the EU its exports would be subject to tariffs and would still have to meet EU production standards, harming the competitiveness of British business.The run-up to the EU referendum is likely to be dominated by competing claims about how many millions of jobs will be lost or gained by Britain's exit. All such claims come with a health warning. Coming up with a precise figure is difficult as there is no way of knowing if threats by foreign companies to scale back their operations in the UK would come to pass or, indeed, how many jobs would be created by the reshaped economy that might emerge in the wake of an exit.Better off out: There would be a jobs boom as firms are freed from EU regulations and red tape, say those arguing for an exit, with small- and medium-sized companies who don't trade with the EU benefiting the most. In its recent paper, the EU Jobs Myth, the free market Institute for Economic Affairs seeks to debunk the claim that 3-4 million jobs would be lost if Britain left. ""Jobs are associated with trade, not membership of a political union, and there is little evidence to suggest that trade would substantially fall between British businesses and European consumers in the event the UK was outside the EU,"" it argues. ""The UK labour market is incredibly dynamic, and would adapt quickly to changed relationships with the EU.""Better off in: Millions of jobs would be lost as global manufacturers moved to lower-cost EU countries. Britain's large, foreign-owned car industry would be particularly at risk. ""The attractiveness of the UK as a place to invest and do automotive business is clearly underpinned by the UK's influential membership of the EU,"" said a KPMG report on the car industry last year. The financial services sector, which employs about 2.1 million people in the UK, also has concerns about a British exit. ""The success of the UK financial services industry is to a large extent built on EU Internal Market legislation. To abandon this for some untried, unknown and unpredictable alternative would carry very significant risks,"" said global law firm Clifford Chance in a report by think tank TheCityUK last year.Much would depend on the trade deals Britain managed to negotiate with the EU and rest of the world after its exit. The best-case scenario, according to think tank Open Europe, is that the UK would be better off by 1.6% of GDP a year by 2030. That is assuming the UK carried out widespread deregulation after its exit and managed to strike favourable trade deals. The think tank adds: ""A far more realistic range is between a 0.8% permanent loss to GDP in 2030 and a 0.6% permanent gain in GDP in 2030, in scenarios where Britain mixes policy approaches"".The Centre for Economic Performance, at the London School of Economics, says the worst-case scenario is a 6.3% to 9.5% reduction in GDP, ""a loss of a similar size to that resulting from the global financial crisis of 2008/09"". The best case, according to their analysis, is a loss of 2.2% of GDP.Better off out: Britain would regain full control of its borders. UKIP wants to see a work permit system introduced, so that EU nationals would face the same visa restrictions as those from outside the EU, which it says would reduce population growth from current levels of 298,000 a year to about 50,000. This would create job opportunities for British workers and boost wages, as well as easing pressure on schools, hospitals and other public services. Better off in: Britain might have to agree to allow free movement of EU migrants as the price of being allowed access to the free market. In any case, immigration from the rest of the EU has been good for Britain's economy. The UK's growth forecasts are based, in part, on continued high levels of net migration. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility says the economy relies on migrant labour and taxes paid by immigrants to keep funding public services.The UK's net contribution to the EU, taking into account the rebate, was £11.3bn in 2013. That is more than four times what it was in 2008. It is about the same amount as the UK government spends on transport every year.Better off out: The UK would save billions in membership fees, and end the ""hidden tariff"" paid by UK taxpayers when goods are exported to the EU, caused by red tape, waste, fraud and other factors. Better off in: The UK's contribution to the EU budget is a drop in the ocean compared with the benefits to business of being in the single market. Better off out: The EU is not as important to British trade as it used to be, and continuing turmoil in the eurozone will make it even less so. Even if Britain did not manage to negotiate a free trade deal with the EU it would not be as disastrous as EU-enthusiasts claim, argues economist Roger Bootle in his book The Trouble with Europe: ""It would place the UK in the same position as the US is currently in, along with India, China and Japan, all of which manage to export to the EU relatively easily."" The UK would be free to establish bilateral trade agreements with fast-growing export markets such as China, Singapore, Brazil, Russia and India through the World Trade Organisation. Better off in: The EU is the UK's main trading partner, worth more than £400bn a year, or 52% of the total trade in goods and services. Complete withdrawal from the EU would see trade barriers erected, with car exports to the EU, for example, facing a 15% tariff and imports a tariff of 10%.  ""The idea that the UK would be freer outside the EU is based on a series of misconceptions, that a medium-sized, open economy could hold sway in an increasingly fractured trading system dominated by the US, the EU and China; that the EU makes it harder for Britain to penetrate emerging markets; and that foreign capital would be more attracted to Britain's economy if it were no longer part of the single market,"" the pro-EU Centre for European Reform said in a recent report.Better off out: The UK would remain a key part of Nato and the UN Security Council and a nuclear power, with a powerful global voice in its own right. The Eurosceptic Bruges Group wants an end to the ""discredited"" principle that Britain acts as a transatlantic bridge between the US and Europe, saying the country should make self-reliance its guiding principle.Better off in: Stripped of influence in Brussels, Berlin and Paris, Britain would find itself increasingly ignored by Washington and sidelined on big transnational issues such as the environment, security and trade. America and other allies want Britain to remain in the EU. The UK risks becoming a maverick, isolated state if it leaves.Better off out: Britain would gain full control of its own borders, with migration in and out of the country regulated solely by British law. It would be more difficult for EU citizens to move to the UK, although those already living here are unlikely to be removed. Better off in: A lot would depend on what kind of deal was reached with the other EU nations. Britons may have to apply for visas to enter EU countries and those already living there may face integration rules, such as proving they can speak the language before gaining long-term residency rights. There would also be uncertainty for many EU workers now paying taxes in the UK - what benefits, if any, would they be entitled to?Better off out: The EU has limited power over tax, which is largely a matter for national governments. The exception is VAT, which has bands agreed at the EU level. Outside the EU, the UK would potentially have more flexibility.Better off in:  ""Tax avoidance and evasion will reach crippling levels as our economy becomes increasingly wholly owned by foreign multinationals that make tax avoidance in Britain central to their business strategy,"" argued the pro-European The Observer newspaper in an editorial.Better off out: It would be a major shot in the arm for British democracy as the Westminster parliament regained its sovereignty and reconnected with voters. The country would be free from the European Arrest Warrant and other law and order measures.Better off in: Britons benefit from EU employment laws and social protections, which would be stripped away. Withdrawal from the European Arrest Warrant could mean delays for the UK in extraditing suspects from other European countries; and the UK already has some opt-outs from EU labour law, including the Working Time Directive."
2015-05-23,Mark Mardell,https://web.archive.org//web/20150524033726/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32803419,"The UK's future direction for at least a generation hangs precariously on an uncertainty, balanced on the tip of the unknown.I am talking of course about the planned referendum on the EU.  The brilliant thing about referendums, and one of the features that makes them so irksome for politicians is their binary clarity - ""Yes"" or ""No"", ""In"" or ""Out"".This one will be like that, but it isn't at the moment. For now, the most important group of potential voters are the ""Maybes"".They are not unsure because they are hesitant Harrys and Harriets who haven't grasped the big issues.It is much more political than that.  Some big names are rallying around the banner of ""Maybe"".The Foreign Secretary Phillip Hammond is one of them, and perhaps the most important is the mop-headed mayhap Boris Johnson. Their eventual decision depends, they say, on what change in the relationship David Cameron manages to negotiate - and that may well depend on what they and others argue, in political cabinet, he should demand. This is unknown because it is as yet undecided. Indeed, I am fairly sure almost all Conservative MPs will be herded into the ""Maybe"" camp by a twitch of deferent loyalty on one flank, the cracking whip of strategic cunning on the other.Those who know with certainty in their own hearts they will vote ""No"" may feel they have to give the prime minister a chance, or appear grossly disloyal. This has the added advantage that having played the part of a loyalist waiting with open-jawed admiration for the prime minister to return home with a piece of paper, their eventual disappointment will pack more heft. At the end of the process, they can declare that, despite all their high expectations, the deal is not good enough, and the obdurate EU has left them with no choice but to campaign for an ""Out"".  Equally, those who are determined to stay in might as well drape themselves in temporary Euroscepticism and mutter about how hard it is for Mr Cameron to ""squeeze anything out of that lot"".  When Mr Cameron returns with a deal, however paltry,  they can proclaim it a master stroke that forces them into the ""Yes"" camp. Still, some will have a genuine bottom line.It is not clear if the prime minister himself is one of them.He has set out, in rather loose terms, his aims, in the Sunday Telegraph last March.The trouble with most of them is that success would be difficult to measure. We will legislate in the first session of the next Parliament for an in-out referendum to be held on Britain's membership of the EU before the end of 2017. We will negotiate a new settlement for Britain in the EU. And then we will ask the British people whether they want to stay in on this basis, or leave. We will protect our economy from any further integration of the Eurozone. The integration of the Eurozone has raised acute questions for non-Eurozone countries like the UK. We benefit from the single market and do not want to stand in the way of the Eurozone resolving its difficulties.But we will not let the integration of the Eurozone jeopardise the integrity of the single market or in any way disadvantage the UK.We want to see powers flowing away from Brussels, not to it. We want national parliaments to be able to work together to block unwanted European legislation. And we want an end to our commitment to an ""ever closer union"", as enshrined in the treaty to which every EU country has to sign up.What sort of change would ensure ""businesses liberated from red tape"" or ""powers flowing away from Brussels""? Words alone would not suffice for those who think such changes are vital if the UK is to stay in the EU - after all, the European Commission would say it backs both. ""Free movement to take up work, not free benefits"" is more concrete and eminently achievable but may not look like the ""fundamental"" change in relationship that is promised. But ""new mechanisms in place to prevent vast migrations across the Continent"" looks much easier to declare as a ""win"" or ""lose"".After persistent warnings, particularly from German Chancellor Angela Merkel, that ""free movement of people"" was not up for grabs, the prime minister appeared to drop the idea. But he told the House of Commons only two months ago: ""In the coming two years, we have the opportunity to reform the EU and fundamentally change Britain's relationship with it. ""We have the opportunity to build a European Union that is more competitive, more flexible and more accountable to the people, where powers flow back to member states, not just away from them, and where freedom of movement is no longer an unqualified right.""How much would the EU have to qualify that right, to persuade the doubters?Would a promise to stop putative Serbians coming to Britain after their country joins, in perhaps 2030, do the trick? Again, that is unknown and uncertain.At the moment, most backbenchers are keeping their heads down and powder dry. But Jacob Rees Mogg, MP for North East Somerset and member of the European Scrutiny Committee in the last Parliament, told me: ""I think the touchstone for renegotiation will be the free movement of people. ""It is one of the four freedoms of the European Union, and if the EU is  willing to give ground on that it will show that it is willing to consider a fundamental reform rather than just tinkering at the edges. ""So it is symbolically important as well as representing a deep concern of the British people.""This is admirable in its clarity, and I suspect it will be a  touchstone too for many of his colleagues. Others may set the bar higher or lower, but one new MP told me: ""I wouldn't like to be in the prime minister's shoes.""He knows it has to be real - he can't just come back with a bit of polish on it."" The prime minister's challenge is to come back with a deal so bright and sunny that the snows of uncertainty melt away to reveal the sunny uplands of victory. Is that likely? Maybe."
2015-05-23,Peer problems?,https://web.archive.org//web/20150524033726/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32725118,"When David Cameron heads to the House of Lords for the Queen's Speech later this month he might want to cast his eye along the red benches. Sitting there will be scores of peers who - when the ermine robes are off and Parliament gets back to business - could start causing a bit of trouble for the government.Managing Mr Cameron's small majority in the Commons - 12 MPs - is going to require some skill from the party whips. But it could turn out to be an easy day at the office compared with handling the complicated mechanics of the Lords where the Conservatives aren't even close to a majority.The numbers - see below - don't add up for the prime minister in the ""upper chamber"".Together, Labour and the Lib Dems have 315 peers - enough to beat the Conservatives by 91 votes. Then there are the crossbench - or independent - peers to think about.  They're hard to predict as they don't vote as a block.  In the worst-case scenario for the Conservatives, their 224 peers are up against a whopping 555 from other parties and groups. On the other hand the crossbenchers could, in theory, help the Conservatives win.  As Professor Meg Russell, Director of the Constitution Unit at University College London, notes: ""The Conservatives are in a relatively weak position in the Lords, holding less than a third of seats. The government can readily be defeated by various combinations of other forces.""Policies that could stir up objections in the Lords include abolishing the Human Rights Act and legislation paving the way for an EU referendum. It's very unusual for peers to vote against an entire Bill. Their style is to go through legislation amending bits they don't like. The government can either accept the changes or overturn them in the Commons. Maybe David Cameron will start wishing he'd pushed on with plans, three years ago, to introduce elected peers. He abandoned the proposals in the face of opposition from Conservative MPs and peers. It was another reprieve for the House of Lords, which has survived numerous attempts at reform over the last 100 years.And there won't be another existential crisis for the time being. The Conservative election manifesto states that they see a ""strong case"" for introducing an ""elected element"" but ""it isn't a priority in the next Parliament"".With wounds to lick and new leaders to choose, Lib Dem and Labour strategists aren't thinking too deeply about their tactics in the  Lords. But as politicians drift back to Westminster the possibilities are starting to bleep on the political radar.Labour peer Lord Foulkes has already been tweeting about what he calls the ""difficult job"" facing the Leader of the Lords, Baroness Stowell, whose task is to get government business through.He predicts ""interesting times"", saying: ""Labour and the Liberal Democrats have a huge majority over the Conservatives. The crossbenchers are unpredictable but on a number of occasions they have come with us. The Lib Dems in the Lords are old-fashioned Lib Dems. They'll be happier working with us than the Tories.""The Liberal Democrats are leading lights in the campaign to turn the House of Lords into an elected chamber. It's a cruel irony that with only eight MPs, the Lib Dems will be relying on an institution they dislike to give them a solid platform at Westminster.How will they get along with their former coalition partners though? The Lib Dem peer, Baroness Hussein-Ece, said the Conservatives were now ""off the leash"" but wouldn't be getting ""an easy ride"".""The dynamics are going to be completely different. We will take things on a policy-by-policy basis. I feel quite passionately about keeping the Human Rights Act and I'm pretty sure that my colleagues will be opposing abolition vociferousIy.""But David Cameron can take some comfort from the fact that the Lib Dems will not be falling into Labour's arms. Baroness Hussein-Ece is certain there will be issues the two parties can agree on but is equally sure they will not form a happy union as a matter of course. She said: ""I'm afraid that the Labour Party is more interested in tribal politics. It could have conducted itself in a more progressive way during the election."" In the last Parliament, the coalition government was defeated 103 times in the Lords and a Labour source in the Lords predicts that the Conservatives will ""want to make up for lost time"". He said: ""What we anticipate is that they will start to look back at the concessions they made and the opposition amendments that got through.""And the feeling is that the government will find ways to use secondary legislation - which empowers ministers to adjust some laws.By convention, the House of Lords is reluctant to challenge policies promised in election manifestos and doesn't vote against measures on taxation and spending. But Professor Russell thinks the rules around those conventions are ""far from clear"" and that Labour and the Lib Dems might be tempted to block what they see as Conservative ""austerity"" measures. Meg Russell says: ""The House of Lords is a complicated place. Historically at least, they have always been very sensitive to public opinion. They are not likely to go in all guns blazing.""How can David Cameron deal with trouble in the Lords - even if it is well-meaning and principled?He can't get rid of any peers but he could, in theory, create a huge number of new Conservative peers to give him a stronger base. ""There are no rules,"" Meg Russell adds of the possibility. ""The prime minister has complete patronage. But of course it wouldn't go down well with the  public and there would be an outcry in Parliament.""And introducing too many new peers would also be embarrassing because the Conservatives have promised to tackle the size of the chamber. With 779 active members, it's one of the largest in the world.The Conservative Lord Cormack thinks that the prime minister shouldn't worry too much because he can rely on the Lords to behave ""with a considerable degree of sense"".""There will be stormy patches and it's always over the things that you don't predict,"" he says. ""But the important thing to do is play to the strengths of the Lords. There's an enormous accumulation of wisdom and experience. It generally improves bills."" He is relaxed about the next few years. ""I don't anticipate any unpleasantness. For the government to be defeated in the House of Lords isn't the end of the world."" And that's because, he said, the Lords believes in the supremacy of the Commons.It may be a while before the new dynamics in the Lords play out. The first bills will be unveiled in the Queen's Speech on 27th May and any controversial ones may not reach the House of Lords until after the summer break.But there's one other constitutional niggle to mention. In theory, all parties should be represented in the House of Lords - even the small ones. The Greens have one peer and UKIP has three. But there are no members of the SNP in the House of Lords. And with 56 MPs, it means the Lords isn't speaking for millions of people in Scotland. The SNP is adamant, though, that it doesn't want anything to do with the place.With the Lords potentially a powerful force, are the Scottish Nationalists missing a trick?Not according to the SNP MP Pete Wishart who declared: ""It's an affront to democracy. We will have nothing to do with this democratic outrage. The House of Lords doesn't need reform. We need to abolish it and start again."""
2015-05-23,Olive branches or burning bridges?,https://web.archive.org//web/20150524033726/http://www.bbc.com/news/education-32796618,"When Nicky Morgan became education secretary last year her biggest strength and biggest problem were the same thing - not being Michael Gove.Her predecessor had cast a long shadow, having dominated the education landscape and in many ways re-made it in his own likeness.Mrs Morgan was introduced as a less confrontational figure, offering an olive branch to a teaching profession that had felt that it was being used for target practice.But many of the questions she faced were about how she defined herself against the Gove legacy, rather than about her own vision.Now she is back under her own steam, authority enhanced and able to stamp her own identity on the Department for Education.So what will be the direction of schools in England under Mrs Morgan? Will it be more olive branches? Or will it be more burning bridges?The first education bill of the new Parliament promises to create hundreds of academies and free schools, with plans to replace the leadership of schools that are struggling. So no surprises there, it's going to be more of the same.And it will raise the same questions about whether structural change really raises standards.But so much of this debate is about the rhetoric rather than the reality - and head teachers have been bristling at the language of threats to send in teams of new leaders to ""failing and coasting schools"".Heads' leaders have been irritated that the public discourse is already so negative.And they ask where are all these armies of superstar replacement heads waiting to be ""parachuted"" into schools?The ""coasting school"" motif really irritates them, not least because it's such a vague term, leaving many heads unsure whether they should be looking over their shoulder.But maybe they should see it as part of the cycle of government.""Hundreds of schools in England which are considered to be 'coasting' are facing a government crackdown."" This was a story from 2007, with an almost identical threat of such lacklustre schools being taken over.And it wasn't even new then. ""The school standards watchdog in England is to crack down on 'coasting' schools"". That was from 1999 - and it annoyed head teachers then too.It's also worth noting that Ofsted at the same time announced that schools would only receive from six to 10 working weeks' notice of an inspection, instead of two terms. It's now less than one day's notice.And schools are still ""coasting"".One of the balancing acts for Mrs Morgan will be how to keep school leaders on board, as serious professional partners, when at the same time the political language about education often reverts into accusations and threats.Heads say they are facing big practical pressures in the next five years - hundreds of thousands of extra pupils needing places, fears of a shortage of teachers and head teachers, and worries about over-stretched budgets.Constantly talking about academies seems an ideological sideshow to them.And the engagement of heads will be crucial in what is going to be a major task for the next five years - rolling out the curriculum and qualifications reforms announced under the previous coalition government. There are bound to be some unforeseen bumps, and downright craters, in this delivery phase.Mrs Morgan has promised that the next five years will see an end to ""constant change"". There was a strong message to teachers during the election campaign that there would be more bedding in and less uprooting.And that means finding a way to avoid any more headline-grabbing changes, without looking like this is an administration that is becalmed. She'll have to show that less is more.But there are still questions to be decided which will be seen as symbolic. Not least about whether to allow a Kent grammar school to open a satellite branch in another town.Speaking privately, heads' leaders say there seems to be a balancing act.Mrs Morgan is described as being much more accessible and wanting a better relationship with the teaching profession - and the atmosphere in the Department for Education is described as ""completely different"" than in the Gove era.They describe ministers as being ""very upbeat"".But head teachers still bridle at what seems to be a very different political tone, that they criticise as negative towards schools, lacking in evidence and counter-productive.Good cop, bad cop? Mrs Morgan now has the chance to establish her own classroom style."
2015-05-23,New-look Commons,https://web.archive.org//web/20150524033726/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32795139,"MPs are back at Westminster to be sworn in as the new Parliament gets under way. But what's new this time around? Here are some things to look out for:Television viewers will get a new perspective on our politicians, thanks to eye-level cameras in the Commons. Approved by the House of Commons Commission in February, the cameras offer an alternative to the traditional high-level fixed positions to which viewers have become accustomed over the years. It comes after TV cameras were allowed into previously forbidden parts of the Palace of Westminster for the BBC's Inside the Commons documentary.The number of women in Parliament has risen by about a third to 191. Female MPs now make up 29% of the overall total. The proportion of female Conservative and Labour MPs has increased, despite an overall fall in the number of Labour MPs. But the biggest rise in female representation in the Commons came from the Scottish National Party, which now has 20 female MPs, up from just one.Labour MP Sir Gerald Kaufman is the new Father of the House, the title given to the MP with the longest continuous service who is not a minister.The member for Manchester Gorton replaces Conservative Sir Peter Tapsell, who stood down as MP at the election. His main duty, as demonstrated on Monday, is to preside over the election of a new Speaker.First elected in 1970, Sir Gerald pips three other MPs - Conservatives Ken Clarke and Michael Meacher, and Dennis Skinner of Labour, who all entered Parliament on the same day - because he swore the oath before them.Labour's acting leader Harriet Harman appointed herself to the unofficial title after pointing out she was the longest-serving female MP in the Commons. The MP for Camberwell and Peckham, first elected in 1982, made the comments during the Speaker's election exchanges, ""to prevent us all from falling headlong into patriarchy"" and promised ""good parenting"" along with Mr Kaufman.At 20 years of age, the SNP's Mhairi Black is the UK's youngest elected MP since 1667.The MP for Paisley and Renfrewshire South, who ousted shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander, found herself surrounded by Labour MPs on the green benches during the Speaker election. The politics student - who worked part-time in a chip shop before winning her seat - has been studying for her final exams in the House of Commons of Library, she revealed in an ITV interview.The influx of SNP MPs has led to some competition on the Labour benches. This was illustrated during the Speaker election as Labour MPs found themselves displaced from their familiar spots when the nationalists arrived early to bag their places. But Labour veteran Dennis Skinner held on to his traditional seat on the front corner of the far opposition bench. The Bolsover MP was spotted wedged in next to the SNP's Chris Law. ""I only had half a cheek on, but I was there before them and I will be there when they are gone,"" he told the Mirror. There are said to be just 427 seats available for MPs, and backbenchers use their prayer cards to guarantee a spot.The Liberal Democrats have been hardest hit by the new seating arrangements, with their eight MPs positioned in a distant corner of the opposition benches. It's a far cry from the days of coalition, when the likes of Nick Clegg and Danny Alexander regularly fielded questions from the despatch box.Aside from the prospect of a new Labour leader grilling Prime Minister David Cameron, the SNP will also get two questions in the weekly Parliamentary showpiece because of its third party status. Moray MP Angus Robertson, the party's Westminster leader, will get the role previously filled by the Liberal Democrats before the coalition government.The new House of Commons is more ethnically diverse than ever, with 41 non-white MPs, up from 27. And for the first time, there is an MP of Chinese origin - Alan Mak, who represents Havant for the Conservatives.Stephen Kinnock, son of former Labour leader Neil, is now an MP for the party. So is Rupa Huq, the sister of former Blue Peter presenter Konnie Huq, and Tulip Siddiq, whose aunt, Sheikh Hasina, is the prime minister of Bangladesh.The new House has 32 gay, lesbian and bisexual MPs - more than in any Parliament in any other country. According to an analysis for the New Statesman, 13 of these are Labour, and 12 are Conservative.For the first time since 1885, there are no former prime ministers anywhere in Parliament. Labour's Gordon Brown stood down at the general election, and neither of his two predecessors, Tony Blair and John Major, took seats in the House of Lords.The elections aren't over in the House of Commons, where chairmen and women have to be voted in to lead most of the Commons select committees.The committees, covering subjects like home affairs, health and transport, have an increasingly high-profile role in holding the government to account, carrying out inquiries, taking evidence from witnesses and publishing reports. Some committees, like foreign affairs and culture, media and sport, are guaranteed a new name in charge because the former holder has left Parliament or been promoted to the government.One thing that hasn't changed, to some people's surprise, is the occupant of the Speaker's chair. John Bercow was re-elected unopposed when MPs returned after the election, despite efforts by the Conservatives to make it easier for him to be unseated at the very end of the last Parliament. Meanwhile, there will be at least one new deputy Speaker - Labour MP Dawn Primarolo stood down, and elections will be held for each of the deputy posts in the coming weeks."

2015-05-24,PM announces freeze in ministers' pay,https://web.archive.org//web/20150524033726/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32863296,"Government ministers' pay will remain frozen for the next five years, David Cameron has announcedWriting in the Sunday Times, the prime minister said we were ""all in this together"" when it came to paying off the national debt.His pledge will save about £800,000 a year and £4m by 2020.The decision means ministerial pay will not have risen for a decade by the end of parliament. Cabinet ministers currently receive a salary of £134,565.This includes their pay as MPs. The prime minister is paid a total of £142,500.Mr Cameron said his decision to freeze ministerial pay for the duration of the parliament was part of his ""One Nation"" approach to tackling the deficit, and becoming a country where ""all hard-working people can get on"".He writes: ""We can't pretend there's not still a long way to go. We've halved the deficit as a share of the economy - but there's still half of it left to pay off.""So we will continue to take the difficult decisions necessary to bring spending down and secure our economy. As we go about doing that, I want people to be in no doubt: I said five years ago we were all in this together, and five years on, nothing has changed.""That's why, for example, I've decided to freeze the pay of the ministers in the government. For me, that's just one step which sends out a clear signal: that as we continue knuckling down as a country, we will all play our part.""Meanwhile, the UK's 650 MPs - who are currently paid £67,060 - are in line for a 9% pay rise later this year after the independent watchdog - known as the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA) -  said pay should rise to £74,000 after the election.Changes brought in after the 2009 expenses scandal mean MPs are no longer in charge of setting their own pay rates, instead this issue now falls within the purview of IPSA.But the government has made it clear that the scale of the IPSA's suggested increase is ""not right"" and should be reconsidered, given that public sector pay rises have been capped at 1%.Is this a surprise? No. Will it save much money? No. Is it symbolically important to the point that it would have been more newsworthy if they'd not done this? Absolutely. The prime minister acknowledges that there are ""difficult decisions"" to come, so this is important symbolically to try to prove, as he puts it, that ""we are all in this together."" What is likely to prove much more tricky is the expected big rise coming soon in the basic pay all MPs receive.After the expenses scandal, parliament decided MPs' pay should be set by an independent body. But always beware the law of unintended consequences: that body could now recommend, against the vociferous protests of the party leaders, a big hike in their pay packets.MPs are also not paid extra for their committee work, although committee chairs get a £14,000 supplement, taking their pay to £81,642.Ahead of Wednesday's Queen's Speech setting out his priorities for the first year of his new term, Mr Cameron used his newspaper column to insist that his new administration would be ""about so much more than balancing the books"".""As we return to office, after five years of a long-term economic plan and sacrifices by the British people, we're on the brink of something different - something special,"" he writes.""We can become a country where all hard-working people can get on; not a two-speed society where some can afford childcare and homes of their own and others cannot.""We can become a country where all children get the education they deserve and no-one settles for a life on benefits; so no-one's background is a barrier to their success.""In other words, we can become One Nation."""
2015-05-24,Cameron urged to make case for EU,https://web.archive.org//web/20150524033726/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32857711,"David Cameron is being urged to make a positive case for Europe if he wants to successfully renegotiate the UK's terms of membership with fellow EU leaders.Pascal Lamy, one of Europe's most senior politicians, told the BBC other leaders wanted to help Mr Cameron win a referendum but he has to help himself.Mr Lamy was director general of the World Trade Organization for 13 years.The PM has pledged to renegotiate a ""better deal"" for the UK and hold an ""in-out"" referendum by the end of 2017.Meanwhile, the Labour Party's acting leader Harriet Harman has said her party has officially dropped its opposition to holding a referendum on the issue.In an interview to be broadcast on BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend later, Mr Lamy - who now heads up the think tank Notre Europe - said he did not agree with the view ""that the Brits have always been a pain in the ass so they can leave and it would be fine"". He said the prime minister started with some credit because of his election victory.""[David Cameron] won an election in a reasonably brilliant way as a politician, as a professional of politics he did a good job and these guys are in the same job and they recognise that"", he said.""There are issues of substance, but the psychology of that matters very much.""  He warned there would be some red lines, such as free movement of people but there was a ""margin of manoeuvre"" over this and exempting the UK from ""ever closer union"". He suggested Mr Cameron's tone would be important.""Most European leaders, including myself, feel David Cameron needs to be able to make a good case for Europe in the referendum.""They need to help them but he himself must make a pro-EU case in the UK, which frankly hasn't been done for the last 15 years.""There has to be some change to the UK narrative, which will probably be the price for a compromise."" Mr Lamy said if Britain left, it would be bad news for the EU. He said in his previous jobs, he found world leaders, like the presidents of China and Brazil, felt the EU was founded on two miracles - peace between France and Germany, and British membership.""Half of the miracle would evaporate if the Brits were to leave the European Union,"" he added.On Friday, the prime minister admitted he has not found himself surrounded by a ""wall of love"", as he put it - but he will find Europe's leaders are willing to help him construct a ladder to hop over the high fence he has built for himself.Labour's Harriet Harman has also said her party would now support David Cameron's planned referendum bill, clearing a path for a ballot by the end of 2017.Writing in the Sunday Times, Ms Harman said: ""We have now had a general election and reflected on the conversations we had on doorsteps throughout the country. The British people want to have a say on the UK's membership of the European Union. ""Labour will therefore now support the EU referendum bill when it comes before the House of Commons.""But she added that although her party was no longer opposing a referendum, Labour would still be campaigning for the UK to remain part of the union.As a high profile, fervent believer in European integration Mr Pascal's words are important - and suggest the European establishment want to give Mr Cameron a deal that will help him win a referendum.If Mr Cameron failed it would inflict a grave, potentially fatal, wound on a project already under assault from numerous directions. They will have their own red lines of course, but Mr Cameron's biggest problem may well come at home. He faces Goldilocks' porridge problem - what is suitable to sup for European leaders may prove too tepid for backbenchers. What is the right temperature for them, is likely to burn lips on the continent. Seeking a deal that is ""just right"" will not be easy.David Cameron is ready to start renegotiating the terms of Britain's EU membership ahead of a referendum.

2015-05-24,Apprenticeship system 'fails young',https://web.archive.org//web/20150524033726/http://www.bbc.com/news/education-32844164,"The apprenticeship system in Britain is ""failing"" and needs reform to address youth unemployment, a new report says. The study, commissioned by the Local Government Association, found 42% of all apprenticeships created in the last five years went to people aged over 25.It said current policy enabled businesses to train established workers rather than unemployed young people.The government said the number of young people not in work, education or training was at its lowest in a decade.It has pledged to create a further three million apprenticeships before the end of Parliament in 2020.   The report, by the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) and the Local Government Association (LGA), found 67% of intermediate-skilled apprentices were already employed by their company when they were given their apprenticeships. The study also said demand for apprenticeships - particularly among young people - had soared, with one million people applying for 85,000 vacancies last year.This was despite two million apprenticeships starting over the last Parliament, the report said. In 2013-14 under-19s applied for 57% of the advertised apprenticeships but were given 27% of them, whereas over-25s made up 7% of applications but filled 37% of the vacancies. The study's authors said the government needed to undertake ""significant reform"" of the apprenticeship system, which they said was ""failing to get to grips with stubbornly high levels of youth unemployment"".Luke Raikes, research fellow at IPPR North, said: ""A high quality apprenticeship system could be used to combat youth unemployment and drive higher productivity, but the system we currently have is failing to deliver.""There is a big gap between the function apprenticeships should have in our economy and how they're being used in practice: the majority of apprenticeships are being used to train older people, and those who are already employed at their company, instead of taking on young people out of work.""Just over a third of apprenticeships created in the last five years were at advanced or higher level, with the majority of places being at the intermediate level.And 24% of 16-18 year olds, and 15% of all intermediate apprentices were not being paid the minimum wage, the report said. Pay was particularly low in hairdressing and childcare, where 42% and 26% of apprentices were paid less than the minimum wage. The report said local apprenticeship hubs should be created and given full control of the apprenticeship grant from central government. This would enable employers to tailor the apprenticeship offer to better meet the needs of local employers and the local economy, it said.Powers and budgets for apprenticeships should also be further devolved to local authorities.   Cllr Peter Box, economy spokesman for the LGA, said: ""A good apprenticeship can give young people the experience, skills and understanding that can often lead straight into a full-time job. ""At present, too many new apprenticeships are low skilled and taken by older people already in work with their employer."""

First of all we'd ask why do we pay these people to react rather than pre-empt massive outcomes. Secondly it might have already been too late.  There might have been a huge sell-off in sterling. Government bonds - known as gilts - might have plunged in value, meaning the cost of borrowing for the Treasury might have soared overnight.Britain's major listed companies might have seen billions wiped off their value in early trading.Of course none of that might happen. Markets might have been very sanguine about quitting the EU. But we don't know and the only way the Bank of England would know was if it did some quiet preparatory work - outside the glare of publicity.That latter hope is now forlorn.The email, from Sir Jon Cunliffe's private secretary to four senior executives, was written on 21 May, the Guardian reported.James Talbot, the head of the monetary assessment and strategy division, was also involved in Project Bookend, the paper said.The email is quoted as saying: ""Jon's proposal, which he has asked me to highlight to you, is that no email is sent to James's team or more broadly around the Bank about the project.""James can tell his team that he is working on a short-term project on European economics in International [division] which will last a couple of months. This will be in-depth work on a broad range of European economic issues. Ideally he would then say no more.""The memo goes on to propose that questions from ""other parties"" about ""whether this was a project to look at the referendum"", should be given the answer, ""that there is a lot going on in Europe in the next couple of months - pointing to some of the specific European economic issues (eg: Greece) that would be of concern to the Bank"".A statement from the bank said: ""Today, information related to planned confidential Bank work on the potential implications of a renegotiation and national referendum on the UK's membership of the European Union made its way into the public domain, due to an internal email sent inadvertently to an external party.""There are a range of economic and financial issues that arise in the context of the renegotiation and national referendum.  It is one of the Bank's responsibilities to assess those that relate to its objectives.""It is not sensible to talk about this work publicly, in advance. But as with work done prior to the Scottish referendum, we will disclose the details of such work at the appropriate time.""While it is unfortunate that this information has entered the public domain in this way, the Bank will maintain this approach.""David Cameron is ready to start renegotiating the terms of Britain's EU membership ahead of a referendum.

Conservative former Cabinet minister Owen Paterson, a prominent eurosceptic, said the Bank's project should include the option of remaining in the European Economic Area without being a member of the EU.""If the Bank does look at those very optimistic options, that is thoroughly worthwhile and I hope they will make those investigations public,"" he told the Today programme.""It isn't either 'remain in the European Union or leap into the darkness'; there are other options,"" he added.BBC business correspondent Joe Lynam said the Bank of England would have kept the project secret to avoid becoming a political ""actor"" in the referendum.The bank had appeared to be ""slightly dragged into"" the debate ahead of the referendum on Scottish independence, he said.He added that there was no evidence that talk on Twitter of it being a deliberate leak was accurate.On Friday Mr Cameron met European counterparts for the first time since his general election victory, and admitted he was ""not met with a wall of love"" as he began diplomatic negotiations aimed at securing changes to the UK's relationship with Brussels.At a summit in Riga he conceded that securing a deal would take ""patience and tenacity"" and refused to ruled out campaigning for Britain to leave the EU if his renegotiation efforts failed."

I would hope that would be investigated fully.""He later said: ""Mr Carmichael has no credibility in continuing as an MP and in my opinion he should stand down. It is appropriate for the Standards Commissioner to get involved and arrive at her own conclusions, having investigated the full facts.""Protests have been held in Kirkwall, Orkney, and Lerwick, Shetland, calling for Mr Carmichael to resign.The confidential memo was published by the Daily Telegraph on 3 April as the general election campaign got under way.It was written by a civil servant in the Scotland Office and claimed Ms Sturgeon told the French Ambassador to the UK, Sylvie Bermann, that she would prefer Mr Cameron, the leader of the Conservatives, to remain as prime minister.The memo also claimed Ms Sturgeon said that Ed Miliband, who was then Labour's leader, was not prime minister material.The official cabinet office inquiry into the leaking of the memo said Mr Carmichael's former special adviser Euan Roddin gave the details to the Daily Telegraph - but he had Mr Carmichael's permission to do so.Mr Carmichael said, while he had not seen the document before it was published by the newspaper, he was ""aware of its content and agreed that my special adviser should make it public""."
2015-05-24,Macintosh supporters being 'bullied',https://web.archive.org//web/20150524033726/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32857281,"Scottish Labour MSP Ken Macintosh has told BBC Scotland the ""party machine"" is bullying his supporters in an attempt to avoid a leadership contest. Mr Macintosh and party deputy leader Kezia Dugdale have confirmed that they are standing for leadership of the party when Jim Murphy quits next month.The Eastwood MSP said his supporters were being ""bullied and intimidated"" into withdrawing their backing.Scottish Labour said the leadership contest would be conducted ""fairly"".A spokesman said Mr Macintosh had since withdrawn his allegations about the party. However, Mr Macintosh insisted his comments still stood but had not been aimed at party staff.He has not named those he thinks are responsible.Scottish Labour general secretary Brian Roy said: ""I have spoken to Ken Macintosh and he has withdrawn his allegations about the party. The leadership contest in Scotland will be conducted fairly and openly.""In response, Mr Macintosh said: ""I am not withdrawing anything. I clarified with Brian [Roy] that the allegations are not against party staff, but against the machine politics which have too much influence in the Labour Party.""Mr Macintosh, the party's social justice spokesman, ran for party leadership against Johann Lamont almost four years ago and is likely to need nominations from six or seven MSPs to be a candidate in this leadership contest. Ms Dugdale, who is widely regarded as the ""obvious person"" to take on the job, confirmed her leadership bid on Friday.But he claims his backers are coming under ""incredible pressure to withdraw their support"".""I want to have a contest but I've found the whole weight of the party machine yet again turning against me trying to close down a contest,"" he told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme. ""All the people that have been trying to support me, the party machine has turned on them, and they are being put under incredible pressure to withdraw their support. They are being bullied and being intimidated and pressurised not to support me so we don't have a contest.""I wouldn't even have put my head above the parapet if I didn't know I had that support.""Mr Macintosh, who won a majority of member votes in the last leadership contest, said the three-college system used by the Labour Party to elect leaders was ""ridiculous"". ""I want the members to take control of the party,"" he said. ""We need to move to one member, one vote.""He called for a quick contest, before the summer if possible, that is ""fair and democratic"".By BBC Scotland political correspondent Glenn CampbellKezia Dugdale already has the backing of twenty Labour MSPs for her bid to become Scottish party leader. That's more than half the Labour team at Holyrood. Many of them would like her elected unopposed. Yet when she announced her intention to stand, Ms Dugdale said she would ""absolutely"" welcome a contest. Ken MacIntosh is offering that challenge. He is likely to require the support of six or seven MSPs to become a candidate. But he claims his supporters are being ""bullied and intimidated"" by what he calls the ""party machine"" in an attempt to avoid a contest. He has not been more specific. There are certainly those who think a coronation would save time and political energy and allow Labour to concentrate on the 2016 Holyrood election campaign. Others argue that a contest would allow a fuller debate about Labour's problems and possible solutions and give the new leader more authority to pursue reform. Mr Macintosh said he would campaign on fairness and social justice across the whole of Scotland with an emphasis on lifelong learning, housing and renewable energy.""The reason I think it is important that I put my views forward is I think that is all about restoring trust in the Labour Party,"" he said. ""At the last election people could not bring themselves to put their trust in Labour. I can't believe that after all these years and what we stand for.""Mr Macintosh said restoring the Scottish Labour Party required integrity, principles and honesty and ""moving away from machine politics and guile and the idea it's about power and position"".""I'm in politics to make other people's lives better, whether I'm leader or not leader, whether I'm MSP or not MSP. I am a conviction politician,"" he said.He said problems with the ""party machine"" were about ""people who want power and position and influence"", which was an ""issue for all politicians"". ""We have to remember our principles and if we can't do that we can't restore confidence in the Labour Party,"" Mr Macintosh added.Former East Renfrewshire MP Mr Murphy announced that he would resign next month after Labour's crushing general election defeat at the hands of the SNP. Ms Dugdale, the Lothian region MSP, said she welcomed a leadership contest. She has won the backing of more than half of Scottish Labour's MSPs and MP Ian Murray since announcing her intention to stand on Friday. ""I am proud to have already won the support of so many Labour colleagues in the Scottish Parliament,"" Ms Dugdale said.""The geographical spread of support I have - with MSPs from north and south, east and west - as well as the backing of MSPs from different parts of our movement shows I can bring our party together."""
2015-05-24,Balls 'not dashing back to politics',https://web.archive.org//web/20150524033726/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32852568,"Ed Balls has told the BBC he will not be ""dashing back"" to frontline politics after losing his seat at the election.He said he had wanted Labour's campaign to be more ""pro-business"" but he had backed Ed Miliband ""100%"" and he shared responsibility for the party's defeat.""In the end he didn't persuade people he could be the prime minister but I didn't persuade people I could be the chancellor either,"" said Mr Balls.He was speaking exclusively to BBC political editor Nick Robinson.In his first interview since election night, the former shadow chancellor spoke of his ""sense of loss"" at Labour' defeat and described losing his seat two weeks ago as ""a symbol of the vibrancy of our democracy"".He said: ""I always knew if the Tories won a majority I was probably a goner, but the reason I travelled 7,500 miles and went to 45 seats was because I was fighting to win."" He added: ""Politics is a brutal business,"" because ""it was a real possibility"" his party might win, and he might become chancellor.Commenting on the campaign, he said: 'I think I wanted to be more pro-business but I also backed Ed Miliband 100%. ""He was the leader I was the shadow chancellor we both worked very hard and in the end neither he or I persuaded people and we need to take our responsibility for that. It's not all on him it's on all of us.""Were you up for that Ed Balls moment - the symbol of Labour's crushing electoral defeat, the trigger for wild Tory celebrations and Labour despair?Ed Balls was in reflective mood when we spoke - looking back at what he'd achieved as much as forward to what might be next.For the rest of Nick's article and a full transcript of the interview, click here.In one of the shock results of election night, the former shadow chancellor lost his Morley and Outwood seat in West Yorkshire by 422 votes to Conservative Andrea Jenkyns.He had previously had a majority of 1,101 in the constituency on the outskirts of Leeds.Asked by Nick Robinson if he was one of the reasons Labour was unelectable, Mr Balls replied: ""Of course. ""I mean Ed Miliband said straight after the election he took responsibility but all of us have to bear our share of responsibility. ""Ed was the leader I backed him as shadow chancellor 100%. In the end he didn't persuade people he could  be the prime minister but I didn't persuade people I could be the chancellor either. I have to take that on the chin. ""People will analyse for weeks and months what happened and that's something that still feels too early for me."" Speaking about his own future, Mr Balls said: ""I'm not going to be dashing back"" to frontline politics but ""never say never"". He was, he said, embarking on ""a new chapter, outside of politics. No by-elections, not back in parliament, that is how it feels at the moment. Outside of politics is where I am going next."" He says his wife Yvette Cooper, who is running to be Labour leader, is ""brilliant and people will get a chance to see what she stands for"" but he insisted that ""I am not playing a role in her campaign"" except ""whilst she is busy I can do more to help family"".  Asked whether whether he worries that she is applying for the toughest job in British politics he said: ""You have to take your calling when it comes."" Mr Balls did not rule out appearing on Strictly Come Dancing - a prospect his wife has described as ""truly terrifying"" - but he told Nick Robinson that despite running three marathons ""I'm not sure if I'm equipped for Strictly."" He said he'd be spending his time ""cooking, running, playing the piano"" and using ""real time to stand back and think"" to write about economics.  He reflected, finally, on his image - and how he was perceived by the electorate:  ""It is very hard in politics for people to see the real you. You are seen through the prism your opponents set up.""Mr Balls' demise spelled the end of a decade in Parliament which has seen him at the heart of the Labour machine.He held the position of chief economic adviser to the Treasury in the Blair government from 1997, working on policies including Sure Start, tax credits and the national minimum wage.Ed Balls first became an MP in 2005 and a year later was made Economic Secretary to the Treasury.He was a close adviser to then-chancellor Gordon Brown and earned a reputation as a political bruiser."
2015-05-24,Cameron 'confident' of EU success,https://web.archive.org//web/20150524033726/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32840696,"David Cameron has said he is confident he can get a better deal for the UK in Europe but admitted it ""won't be easy"". Speaking at an EU summit in Latvia, he said he had not been greeted ""by a wall of love"" when he met EU leaders for the first time since his election win.But he said he had a mandate and the ""British people at his back"" for the changes he wanted to achieve.The prime minister will hold talks with Angela Merkel and EU Commission boss Jean-Claude Juncker next week.Mr Cameron will also meet French President Francois Hollande as he tries to win support for his position.Other EU countries have said they will listen to what the UK has to say, the Finnish prime minister Alexander Stubb saying he backed the UK's proposals to cut red tape and was sure ""some kind of compromise"" could be reached. But some member states have questioned the need for any change to EU treaties, something Mr Cameron has said he wants to see, and ruled out any watering down of the key principle of freedom of movement. Speaking at a meeting of EU leaders, Mr Cameron said he believed it was in the interests of both the UK and its European partners for the UK to remain part of the European Union but under different terms.The British people, he said, were not happy with the status quo and wanted change on issues such as welfare, immigration and an opt-out from further integration.Mr Cameron said he had only begun to ""scratch the surface"" of the discussions but would travel to Berlin and Paris next week as well as hosting European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker at his country residence, Chequers, on Monday.He said the British people needed ""the best possible choice"" about the UK's future in Europe and did not rule out bringing forward his promised referendum, currently scheduled to take place by the end of 2017. Mr Cameron said he expected ""lots of ups and downs"" in the process and reminding journalists that many of their pre-election forecasts were wrong, he urged them to ""wait for the result"".""I do not expect to find agreed solutions straight away,"" he told them.""These talks will require patience and tenacity. But by working together in the right spirit and sticking at it, I believe we can reform the EU and our relationship with it. And then the British people will have the final say. They will decide.""The changes he was seeking were ""deliverable and doable"", he insisted.""I've set out a series of changes which I think address the main concerns that British people have, that I have, about Europe and the way it works. And I'm confident of getting those changes.""British officials said the process was at a very early stage, but the meetings with Mrs Merkel, regarded as Germany's most powerful leader and Mr Juncker, the most senior official in Brussels, will be seen as key to setting the tone for future discussions. Mr Cameron is committed to holding an in/out referendum on Britain's membership of the EU by the end of 2017, but there is speculation it could be held next year to avoid a clash with elections in France and Germany.Legislation paving the way for the UK referendum is expected to be published next Thursday, the day after the Queen opens Parliament.Asked whether he would be prepared to recommend a UK exit if he did not get the outcome he wanted, Mr Cameron said he would ""not rule anything out"". David Cameron is ready to start renegotiating the terms of Britain's EU membership ahead of a referendum. Here is some further reading on what it all means: The UK and the EU: Better off in or out?What Britain wants from EuropeQ&A: The UK's planned EU referendumTimeline: EU referendum debateWhy Germany is David Cameron's new best friendBBC deputy political editor James Landale said Mr Cameron had used the summit, arranged to discuss the EU's relationship with Russia and its neighbours, to sound out other European leaders about what they might be willing to accept before the start of ""intricate"" negotiations in the coming months.Other EU leaders, he added, were ""scared witless"" by the possibility of the UK leaving the EU and were willing to listen and consider a deal, but there were some things - such as changes to freedom of movement rules - which were ""sacrosanct"".Mr Cameron has not revealed the full details of what he is seeking from any changes, but he is expected to demand an opt-out from one its core principles of forging an ""ever-closer union"" between member states. He will also try to get more powers to block or opt out of new EU laws, and for restrictions on welfare benefits for migrants until they have lived in the UK for four years.This week, a number of UK business leaders started to highlight the potential implications of the referendum, with the president of the CBI saying businesses should ""speak out early"" in favour of remaining in a reformed EU,The Labour Party, SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems are in favour of staying in the EU. UKIP, which got almost four million votes but only one MP in the election, want to leave."

I'm very pleased."""

And who is vying for the deputy leader job?Shadow health minister Liz Kendall was the first Labour MP to say they wanted a crack at the party's top job, saying a ""fundamentally new approach"" was needed.First elected to Parliament in 2010 as MP for Leicester West and appointed to the shadow front bench the same year, Ms Kendall is seen as a Blairite contender.She is a former special adviser to Harriet Harman and then Health Secretary Patricia Hewitt who has argued for reform of public services.In an interview for The House magazine in January, she said there ""will remain a role"" for private and voluntary firms in the health service, ""where they can add extra capacity to the NHS or challenge to the system"".Could she be a fresh face to lead a change of direction for Labour, or seen as too inside the Westminster bubble?The Labour MP for Leigh since 2001, Andy Burnham has plenty of government experience and is the current bookies' favourite.Mr Burnham served as health secretary under Gordon Brown and previously as culture secretary and chief secretary to the Treasury.He stood for the leadership in 2010 but lost out to Ed Miliband, going on to hold the shadow health brief under Mr Miliband's leadership. He is said to have strong trade union support.Declaring his intention to stand, he said Labour must support the ""aspirations of everyone"".Another former chief secretary to the Treasury - as well as a work and pensions minister under Gordon Brown - Yvette Cooper has been shadow home secretary for the past four years.A strong Commons performer, she has given Home Secretary Theresa May a hard time over matters including passport delays, border controls and extremism.She did not stand to succeed Mr Brown in 2010, in favour of her husband, Ed Balls.Announcing her bid this time around, she said: ""Our promise of hope wasn't strong enough to drown out the Tory and UKIP voices of fear.

He said in a statement posted on his Twitter feed that had been uncomfortable with the level of ""sheer pressure"" and scrutiny that came with being a candidate.The 36-year-old added that it had perhaps been ""too soon"" for him to launch a leadership bid.Another rising star of the 2010 intake, the MP for Leeds West was appointed shadow chief secretary to the Treasury in 2011 and shadow work and pensions secretary in 2013.During the election campaign, she attacked the so-called bedroom tax, whereby housing benefit payments are reduced for tenants in council and social housing deemed to have spare rooms.However, she also suggested Labour would consider reducing the overall welfare cap in some areas.She told BBC News Labour needs ""to be in the centre ground to win a general election"" but ruled herself out of a leadership bid.A former home secretary and shadow chancellor, Alan Johnson is the Labour leadership candidate who never quite was.The popular MP declined to stand in 2010 and stepped down from his shadow cabinet role in 2011 for personal reasons.Earlier this year it was reported that senior New Labour figures Lord Mandelson and Alistair Campbell approached Mr Johnson over a leadership bid, although all three later distanced themselves from the story.But the former postman, who has been MP for Hull West and Hessle since 1997, had seemingly ruled himself out again, saying it is a ""10-year job"" and he does not have the ""right qualities"". Former army officer Dan Jarvis was elected MP for Barnsley Central in a by-election in 2011, having resigned his commission as a major in the Parachute Regiment to contest the seat.He held onto his seat at the general election, taking time out from campaigning to run the London Marathon last month.After entering Parliament in 2010, he quickly became a shadow culture, media and sport minister and later a shadow justice minister.In 2011, Mr Jarvis became the first serving politician in more than 60 years to be awarded a military honour, when he was made an MBE for his services to the armed forces.He has been touted by some colleagues as a future Labour leader but Mr Jarvis, who was widowed in 2010 and has a young family, ruled himself out, saying it is not the ""right time"" for him and his family. Historian and journalist Tristram Hunt entered Parliament in 2010 as Labour MP for Stoke-on-Trent Central.Ed Miliband made him shadow education secretary in 2013 and he has been a fierce critic of the coalition's education policies in England.Speaking in the aftermath of the election results, he called on Labour's ruling National Executive Committee ""not to rush our election"", saying there was time for a ""brutal post-mortem"" about Labour's ""underlying philosophy and thinking"".As for his own ambitions, he said ""it's about the lyrics as much as the lead singer I think"".He later said he was not confident of getting enough nominations to stand, and would support Liz Kendall.The MP for Rochdale says the deputy leader vacancy has ""come a bit too soon"" for him.He previously said a number of colleagues had asked him to put his name forward for the role.Mr Danczuk is well known for his prominent campaigning against child sex abuse and leading calls for an inquiry into allegations of historical child sex abuse by senior figures at Westminster.He was a vocal critic of Ed Miliband and in an article for the Daily Telegraph on Thursday he said Labour needed to ""step out if its Metropolitan comfort zone"" and ""reach out to the country once more.""The former director of public prosecutions has only just become an MP after being elected in Frank Dobson's old seat of Holborn and St Pancras, in North London at the general election.He was forced to rule himself out of the race to be Labour leader following a social media campaign urging him to stand.He said he was ""flattered"" by the campaign but the party needed someone with ""more political experience"".The older brother of ex-leader Ed, David Miliband was frontrunner to replace Gordon Brown in 2010, until his sibling beat him by a whisker.A former foreign secretary and MP for South Shields, he was the Blairite choice for leader but eventually quit Parliament to become head of the International Rescue Committee charity in New York in 2013.Speaking to the BBC from the US on the Monday after the general election, Mr Miliband criticised his brother's campaign in the 2015 general election, saying he and Mr Brown had ""allowed themselves to be portrayed as moving backwards from the principles of aspiration and inclusion that are the absolute heart of any successful progressive political project"".While he acknowledged the two men were ""brothers for life"", he also confirmed he was not eligible to stand for the party leadership as he is not an MP.Labour's election rulesMPs wishing to stand as leader and deputy leader have to be nominated by 15% of their colleagues in the Parliamentary Labour Party to be eligible to stand.As Labour now has 232 MPs, this means prospective candidates must get at least 34 signatures. That means the maximum size of any field is six contenders.Under rules agreed last year, all Labour Party members, registered supporters and affiliated supporters - including union members - will be allowed a maximum of one vote each on a one member, one vote system. When the election is held, they will be asked to rank candidates in order of preference.If no candidate gets 50% of all votes cast, the votes will be added up and the candidate with the fewest votes eliminated. Their 2nd preference votes will then be redistributed until one candidate has 50% of all votes cast."
2015-05-24,What Britain wants from Europe,https://web.archive.org//web/20150524033726/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32695399,"David Cameron says he has a mandate to pursue EU reform following the Conservatives' general election victory. The PM, who will be hoping his majority government will give him extra leverage in Brussels, wants to renegotiate the terms of the UK's membership ahead of a referendum by the end of 2017. He has said he will campaign for Britain to remain in the EU if he gets the reforms he wants.Mr Cameron has said he does not want to reveal full details of his negotiating hand but he has given a broad indication, in a series of speeches and newspaper articles, of his priorities when he goes into talks with other EU leaders.These are: The prime minister has said Britain would resist any move towards a European Army and that he wants to free British police forces from EU interference. He has also ruled out Britain joining the euro.But he has placed less emphasis in recent years on demanding changes to EU social policy, such as the maximum 48-hour working week, agency workers, maternity leave and non-discrimination rules.The official UK government position is that a referendum will be held by the end of 2017 but Downing Street sources have said: ""If we can do it earlier we will.""There is speculation David Cameron is planning to hold the vote in 2016 to avoid a clash with French and German elections in 2017.The prime minister wants treaty change but even if the referendum was held in 2017 there may not be enough time to legally incorporate any reforms into a treaty and it would have to be done at a later stage.An early referendum would anger Eurosceptics who believe it would not allow enough time to make the case for exit or negotiate any meaningful concessions.""A rushed process would severely undermine the chances to secure a significant deal that both British business and voters could support and would waste the opportunity of a lifetime,"" Matthew Elliott, chief executive of Business for Britain told Breitbart London.The question is always crucial in any referendum and there is already a debate about what it should be. The Draft European Union (Referendum) Bill, published by the Conservatives in 2013, proposed this form of words: ""Do you think that the United Kingdom should remain a member of the European Union?""Some thought that leaned too far towards the status quo, encouraging a yes vote, and the Electoral Commission said it was not clear and direct enough. The watchdog proposed this form of words instead: ""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union?""The new Conservative government will attempt to repeal the Human Rights Act, which requires UK courts to treat the European Court of Human Rights as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. The European Court of Human Rights is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe (CoE), which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine.The freedom for people to move around Europe, enshrined in the EU treaties, works in parallel with the other three basic freedoms in the single market: freedom of goods, capital and services.It is likely to be a ""red line"" for other EU leaders, who do not want to see it eroded.Mr Cameron has steered clear of tackling it directly - for example by asking for an emergency ""brake"" on free movement, or a cap on numbers - focusing instead on reducing the incentive provided by welfare payments. In a speech last November, David Cameron set out measures to reduce the number of EU nationals moving to the UK.His main proposals were:Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission, has said he is ready to work with Mr Cameron to ""strike a fair deal for the United Kingdom in the EU"". The leaders of other EU nations have previously warned they are unlikely to support major changes to EU treaties to accommodate British demands. But Mr Cameron's general election victory may have given him extra leverage. ""The ball is very much in the court of the UK now,"" a senior EU official told The Guardian. ""It's up to the British to define what they want."" The key figure will be German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is very keen to keep Britain in the EU but has so far been unwilling to make major concessions to enable that to happen. There are fears that a ""pick and mix"" approach to EU treaties would undermine EU cohesion.Mr Cameron has said there is ""no doubt"" his planned reforms will require changes to the treaties governing the European Union. But this would require the unanimous support of all EU members, and may not be possible within the deadline he has set of a referendum before the end of 2017. Any attempt to change EU laws on free movement would meet fierce resistance from some EU nations, particularly Eastern European states. Mr Juncker has said free movement is non-negotiable.Mr Cameron may find it difficult to get unanimous support for his proposals for a four-year waiting period for migrant workers claiming UK benefits. East European EU members would be likely to oppose this, on the grounds that it would discriminate against their citizens.  Attempts to secure opt-outs for the City are unlikely to go down well with other European leaders.However, there are precedents for EU treaty changes to accommodate some countries' specific concerns - for example, the protocol attached to the Lisbon Treaty for Ireland.Mr Cameron has faced repeated calls to say whether he would campaign for Britain's exit from the EU in the referendum if he fails to get what he wants from the renegotiation process. All he has said is that he will ""rule nothing out"". Some Conservative MPs want Britain to leave the EU no matter what David Cameron manages to renegotiate. A larger group are likely to want more concessions than Mr Cameron has so far indicated he is prepared to demand.Senior backbencher David Davis, who was defeated by Mr Cameron for the Tory leadership in 2005, told the Daily Telegraph the majority of the 332 Conservative MPs want Mr Cameron to negotiate an ""opt-out"" power to stop individual EU laws from applying to Britain. The prime minister has said this would be ""impossible"" without Britain leaving the EU.Mr Davis claims as many as 60 Tory MPs would be prepared to rebel and vote for Britain's exit from the EU if the prime minister fails to deliver.Graham Brady, chairman of the Tory backbench 1922 committee, which represents backbenchers, has urged David Cameron to give all Conservative MPs, including ministers, a free vote in the EU referendum.In January, Mr Cameron warned that serving cabinet ministers would have to quit the government if they wanted to campaign to leave the EU if he had secured the reforms to it he wants.In the 1975 referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Economic Community, as the EU was then called, Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson decided to suspend collective responsibility because his cabinet was split on the issue. Ministers were allowed to vote with their consciences and campaign against each other. The majority of them, including Mr Wilson, joined the Yes camp, but left-wingers, such as Tony Benn, played a leading role in the No campaign. The Yes campaign won easily with 67% of the vote."

2015-05-24,Man overboard,https://web.archive.org//web/20150524033726/http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-32830379,"Harold Wilson died 20 years ago, on 24 May 1995. He would have died many years before that, writes novelist Isabel Wolff, had her family not saved him from drowning. As a child I spent many family holidays on the Isles of Scilly, 28 miles off the Cornish coast. We'd spend our time walking, cycling and, best of all, rock-pooling.  But where we would normally expect to catch a few shrimps and the odd crab, there was one memorable year when we pulled the Leader of Her Majesty's Opposition out of the water.  It was 10 August 1973 and we were enjoying a bike ride around the largest island, St Mary's. I was with my parents, my elder brother Simon, 16, then a pupil at Rugby School, his best friend Robert, and my younger brother, Matthew, who was 10.  As we cycled along a path above an isolated bay, Matthew spotted an empty rubber dinghy racing out to the open sea. As we watched it speed towards the horizon we wondered whose it was and why it was loose.  Suddenly my father said that he thought he'd heard a cry. Sure enough, above the buffeting of the wind we could just make out a distressed male voice. My father cupped his hands and shouted: ""What is your trouble?""  ""I can't get into my boat,"" the voice answered. ""Fetch a dinghy!""  We pedalled down to the bay as fast as we could.  My father yelled: ""We'll get to you in a few minutes. Can you hold on?""  ""Yes - for a bit,"" came the faint reply. While Robert sped off to alert the Coastguard, Simon found a dinghy - but it had no oars. My father hurriedly looked around for a pair but then, further off, saw a wooden ""pram"" dinghy, its oars still in its rowlocks.  He and Simon carried this to the water's edge and, with Simon guiding him, my father rowed out towards a group of motor launches moored about 300 yards from the shore. While they did this my mother, Matthew and I waited on the beach, which was deserted except for a benign looking Labrador chained up by a fisherman's hut.  The dog's name tag said ""Paddy"" and Matthew and I stroked his ears while we anxiously waited for events to unfold.   Twenty minutes later we saw my father and Simon coming back. Hunched between them in the boat was a bedraggled looking, but familiar figure.  ""It's Harold Wilson,"" I said.  As my father rowed towards the quay, the Labour leader suddenly stood up, nearly swamping the boat. He then sat down again until it had docked, and Simon helped him onto dry land.  I vividly recall how shocked he looked. His shorts and shirt were drenched, his hair was plastered to his scalp, his teeth were chattering and his face was white.  He declined my father's offer of further help, including the loan of a bike to get back to his bungalow, but said that he was glad that we'd come along when we did.  My father jovially responded that it wasn't every day one pulled a former prime minister out of the water and that we were happy to have been able to help.  Satisfied that Wilson was all right, we left him with Paddy and cycled away.  As we ate our picnic lunch my father and Simon explained that Wilson had slipped into the sea while attempting to step from his rubber dinghy onto his motor launch.  The dinghy had shot away from him - the dinghy that we'd seen.  Unable to pull himself into the boat, Wilson had been left hanging on to the fender ropes for dear life. He'd told them that he'd been feeling sea-sick and that his arms felt ""numb"" and were ""giving out"".  Simon had stepped on to Wilson's boat and had then hauled the man on to the deck ""like a sack of potatoes"".  Dad then swore us all to secrecy - if the story got out it could ruin the opposition leader's holiday, and our own.  The next morning we went down to Porthcressa and by chance we saw Wilson coming off the beach.   I remember thinking that he'd be happy to see us again - perhaps he'd even ask us to tea? To my surprise I saw a flash of irritation cross his face.   My father greeted him and asked how he was.  He replied that he felt all right, if rather stiff, and that he had spent the rest of the day in bed.  ""I've had my swim for the holiday though,"" he added pleasantly, then he went on his way and we didn't see him again.  Returning home after the holiday we told no-one what had happened but somehow, a month later, the story got out.  First my father was approached by our local paper which made the story a splash: ""Rugby Family Rescues Mr. Wilson From Sea."" This got picked up by the Birmingham Post and within 48 hours my father's face was on the front of every national newspaper.  Headlines such as ""Wilson Snatched From Drowning"" and ""Wilson Rescued in Sea Drama"" amused us, but we were outraged by the Daily Mirror's ""My Dog Tipped me In!""  In a piece of Labour spin, Wilson's press secretary, Joe Haines, had apparently blamed the labrador.  There was even a photo of ""the culprit"", Paddy, who was ""in the doghouse"".  One could see the need for damage limitation - the incident was extremely embarrassing for Wilson, not least because the Prime Minister Ted Heath was a world-class yachtsman. There were cartoons of Heath grinning at the news on board his yacht, Morning Cloud.  My father, a nuclear engineer, was besieged at work by TV film crews and quizzed about his voting habits. ""Lifelong Tory Saves Wilson from Drowning"", announced the Daily Telegraph.  The Times pointed out that the Labour Leader, whose party had pledged to end private education, had been rescued by a public schoolboy.  And so it went on. We put up with myriad jokes of the ""Why didn't you throw him back?"" variety.  In the meantime Haines continued to elaborate on the story.  Wilson, he claimed in the Mirror, was in ""no danger"".  He ""could have swum to the beach"" but was ""waiting for a friend"".  The truth is, Harold Wilson would have died.  Aged 57, he'd been in the cold water, never more than 15C on Scilly, for more than half an hour.  Knowing the strong Atlantic currents, he hadn't dared risk the long swim back to the beach.  Worst of all, in that deserted spot, there had been no-one to hear his cries.   Reflecting on the incident afterwards, my father told us that Wilson seemed not to understand that it was ""only by the slenderest margins"" that his life had been saved.  Six months later, in February 1974, Harold Wilson became prime minister again.It's now 42 years since ""The Wilson Affair"" as my family always called it.  It seems strange that despite all the publicity this very significant event in the life of Wilson is almost unknown.  Neither of his official biographers, Ben Pimlott and Philip Ziegler, mentioned it in their respective books, nor did Joe Haines revisit it in his own memoir of Wilson, Glimmers of Twilight.  I sometimes wondered how Wilson's colleagues had viewed the story at the time. Were they sympathetic? Amused?  Did they pull his leg about it?  ""Oh I remember it well,"" Denis Healey told me when I phoned him in the House of Lords a few months ago. ""Harold seemed very embarrassed by it and was clearly anxious to play the whole thing down.  We didn't feel that we could mention it to him - definitely not.""  And if my family hadn't happened to pass by when we did?  It's fair to say that the course of British politics might have been rather different.  Denis Healey or Jim Callaghan might have succeeded Wilson. Edward Heath might not have been defeated in 1974 and there might well have been no Tory leadership challenge the following year and therefore, quite possibly, no Thatcher premiership.  My late brother, Simon, used to wonder whether our father may, on that fateful August day, have inadvertently launched Margaret  Thatcher's prime ministerial career. The rest, as they say, is history.Isabel Wolff is author of GhostwrittenSubscribe to the BBC News Magazine's email newsletter to get articles sent to your inbox"
2015-05-24,Out or in?,https://web.archive.org//web/20150524033726/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32793642,"David Cameron has promised a referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Union by the end of 2017. Here is a summary of the key arguments for and against British membership.If Britain votes to leave the EU, it will have to negotiate a new trading relationship with what would now be a 27 member organisation, to allow British firms to sell goods and services to EU countries without being hit by excessive tariffs and other restrictions.Better off out: Britain could negotiate an ""amicable divorce"", but retain strong trading links with EU nations, say those campaigning for Britain's exit. There are several potential scenarios:Better off in: An ""amicable divorce"" is a pipe dream, pro-EU campaigners argue. France, Germany and other leading EU nations would never allow Britain a ""pick and mix"" approach to the bloc's rules. Norway and Switzerland have to abide by many EU rules without any influence over how they are formed. Negotiating a comprehensive free trade agreement could take years and have an uncertain outcome. And if Britain went for a completely clean break with the EU its exports would be subject to tariffs and would still have to meet EU production standards, harming the competitiveness of British business.The run-up to the EU referendum is likely to be dominated by competing claims about how many millions of jobs will be lost or gained by Britain's exit. All such claims come with a health warning. Coming up with a precise figure is difficult as there is no way of knowing if threats by foreign companies to scale back their operations in the UK would come to pass or, indeed, how many jobs would be created by the reshaped economy that might emerge in the wake of an exit.Better off out: There would be a jobs boom as firms are freed from EU regulations and red tape, say those arguing for an exit, with small- and medium-sized companies who don't trade with the EU benefiting the most. In its recent paper, the EU Jobs Myth, the free market Institute for Economic Affairs seeks to debunk the claim that 3-4 million jobs would be lost if Britain left. ""Jobs are associated with trade, not membership of a political union, and there is little evidence to suggest that trade would substantially fall between British businesses and European consumers in the event the UK was outside the EU,"" it argues. ""The UK labour market is incredibly dynamic, and would adapt quickly to changed relationships with the EU.""Better off in: Millions of jobs would be lost as global manufacturers moved to lower-cost EU countries. Britain's large, foreign-owned car industry would be particularly at risk. ""The attractiveness of the UK as a place to invest and do automotive business is clearly underpinned by the UK's influential membership of the EU,"" said a KPMG report on the car industry last year. The financial services sector, which employs about 2.1 million people in the UK, also has concerns about a British exit. ""The success of the UK financial services industry is to a large extent built on EU Internal Market legislation. To abandon this for some untried, unknown and unpredictable alternative would carry very significant risks,"" said global law firm Clifford Chance in a report by think tank TheCityUK last year.Much would depend on the trade deals Britain managed to negotiate with the EU and rest of the world after its exit. The best-case scenario, according to think tank Open Europe, is that the UK would be better off by 1.6% of GDP a year by 2030. That is assuming the UK carried out widespread deregulation after its exit and managed to strike favourable trade deals. The think tank adds: ""A far more realistic range is between a 0.8% permanent loss to GDP in 2030 and a 0.6% permanent gain in GDP in 2030, in scenarios where Britain mixes policy approaches"".The Centre for Economic Performance, at the London School of Economics, says the worst-case scenario is a 6.3% to 9.5% reduction in GDP, ""a loss of a similar size to that resulting from the global financial crisis of 2008/09"". The best case, according to their analysis, is a loss of 2.2% of GDP.Better off out: Britain would regain full control of its borders. UKIP wants to see a work permit system introduced, so that EU nationals would face the same visa restrictions as those from outside the EU, which it says would reduce population growth from current levels of 298,000 a year to about 50,000. This would create job opportunities for British workers and boost wages, as well as easing pressure on schools, hospitals and other public services. Better off in: Britain might have to agree to allow free movement of EU migrants as the price of being allowed access to the free market. In any case, immigration from the rest of the EU has been good for Britain's economy. The UK's growth forecasts are based, in part, on continued high levels of net migration. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility says the economy relies on migrant labour and taxes paid by immigrants to keep funding public services.The UK's net contribution to the EU, taking into account the rebate, was £11.3bn in 2013. That is more than four times what it was in 2008. It is about the same amount as the UK government spends on transport every year.Better off out: The UK would save billions in membership fees, and end the ""hidden tariff"" paid by UK taxpayers when goods are exported to the EU, caused by red tape, waste, fraud and other factors. Better off in: The UK's contribution to the EU budget is a drop in the ocean compared with the benefits to business of being in the single market. Better off out: The EU is not as important to British trade as it used to be, and continuing turmoil in the eurozone will make it even less so. Even if Britain did not manage to negotiate a free trade deal with the EU it would not be as disastrous as EU-enthusiasts claim, argues economist Roger Bootle in his book The Trouble with Europe: ""It would place the UK in the same position as the US is currently in, along with India, China and Japan, all of which manage to export to the EU relatively easily."" The UK would be free to establish bilateral trade agreements with fast-growing export markets such as China, Singapore, Brazil, Russia and India through the World Trade Organisation. Better off in: The EU is the UK's main trading partner, worth more than £400bn a year, or 52% of the total trade in goods and services. Complete withdrawal from the EU would see trade barriers erected, with car exports to the EU, for example, facing a 15% tariff and imports a tariff of 10%.  ""The idea that the UK would be freer outside the EU is based on a series of misconceptions, that a medium-sized, open economy could hold sway in an increasingly fractured trading system dominated by the US, the EU and China; that the EU makes it harder for Britain to penetrate emerging markets; and that foreign capital would be more attracted to Britain's economy if it were no longer part of the single market,"" the pro-EU Centre for European Reform said in a recent report.Better off out: The UK would remain a key part of Nato and the UN Security Council and a nuclear power, with a powerful global voice in its own right. The Eurosceptic Bruges Group wants an end to the ""discredited"" principle that Britain acts as a transatlantic bridge between the US and Europe, saying the country should make self-reliance its guiding principle.Better off in: Stripped of influence in Brussels, Berlin and Paris, Britain would find itself increasingly ignored by Washington and sidelined on big transnational issues such as the environment, security and trade. America and other allies want Britain to remain in the EU. The UK risks becoming a maverick, isolated state if it leaves.Better off out: Britain would gain full control of its own borders, with migration in and out of the country regulated solely by British law. It would be more difficult for EU citizens to move to the UK, although those already living here are unlikely to be removed. Better off in: A lot would depend on what kind of deal was reached with the other EU nations. Britons may have to apply for visas to enter EU countries and those already living there may face integration rules, such as proving they can speak the language before gaining long-term residency rights. There would also be uncertainty for many EU workers now paying taxes in the UK - what benefits, if any, would they be entitled to?Better off out: The EU has limited power over tax, which is largely a matter for national governments. The exception is VAT, which has bands agreed at the EU level. Outside the EU, the UK would potentially have more flexibility.Better off in:  ""Tax avoidance and evasion will reach crippling levels as our economy becomes increasingly wholly owned by foreign multinationals that make tax avoidance in Britain central to their business strategy,"" argued the pro-European The Observer newspaper in an editorial.Better off out: It would be a major shot in the arm for British democracy as the Westminster parliament regained its sovereignty and reconnected with voters. The country would be free from the European Arrest Warrant and other law and order measures.Better off in: Britons benefit from EU employment laws and social protections, which would be stripped away. Withdrawal from the European Arrest Warrant could mean delays for the UK in extraditing suspects from other European countries; and the UK already has some opt-outs from EU labour law, including the Working Time Directive."
2015-05-24,Mark Mardell,https://web.archive.org//web/20150524033726/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32803419,"The UK's future direction for at least a generation hangs precariously on an uncertainty, balanced on the tip of the unknown.I am talking of course about the planned referendum on the EU.  The brilliant thing about referendums, and one of the features that makes them so irksome for politicians is their binary clarity - ""Yes"" or ""No"", ""In"" or ""Out"".This one will be like that, but it isn't at the moment. For now, the most important group of potential voters are the ""Maybes"".They are not unsure because they are hesitant Harrys and Harriets who haven't grasped the big issues.It is much more political than that.  Some big names are rallying around the banner of ""Maybe"".The Foreign Secretary Phillip Hammond is one of them, and perhaps the most important is the mop-headed mayhap Boris Johnson. Their eventual decision depends, they say, on what change in the relationship David Cameron manages to negotiate - and that may well depend on what they and others argue, in political cabinet, he should demand. This is unknown because it is as yet undecided. Indeed, I am fairly sure almost all Conservative MPs will be herded into the ""Maybe"" camp by a twitch of deferent loyalty on one flank, the cracking whip of strategic cunning on the other.Those who know with certainty in their own hearts they will vote ""No"" may feel they have to give the prime minister a chance, or appear grossly disloyal. This has the added advantage that having played the part of a loyalist waiting with open-jawed admiration for the prime minister to return home with a piece of paper, their eventual disappointment will pack more heft. At the end of the process, they can declare that, despite all their high expectations, the deal is not good enough, and the obdurate EU has left them with no choice but to campaign for an ""Out"".  Equally, those who are determined to stay in might as well drape themselves in temporary Euroscepticism and mutter about how hard it is for Mr Cameron to ""squeeze anything out of that lot"".  When Mr Cameron returns with a deal, however paltry,  they can proclaim it a master stroke that forces them into the ""Yes"" camp. Still, some will have a genuine bottom line.It is not clear if the prime minister himself is one of them.He has set out, in rather loose terms, his aims, in the Sunday Telegraph last March.The trouble with most of them is that success would be difficult to measure. We will legislate in the first session of the next Parliament for an in-out referendum to be held on Britain's membership of the EU before the end of 2017. We will negotiate a new settlement for Britain in the EU. And then we will ask the British people whether they want to stay in on this basis, or leave. We will protect our economy from any further integration of the Eurozone. The integration of the Eurozone has raised acute questions for non-Eurozone countries like the UK. We benefit from the single market and do not want to stand in the way of the Eurozone resolving its difficulties.But we will not let the integration of the Eurozone jeopardise the integrity of the single market or in any way disadvantage the UK.We want to see powers flowing away from Brussels, not to it. We want national parliaments to be able to work together to block unwanted European legislation. And we want an end to our commitment to an ""ever closer union"", as enshrined in the treaty to which every EU country has to sign up.What sort of change would ensure ""businesses liberated from red tape"" or ""powers flowing away from Brussels""? Words alone would not suffice for those who think such changes are vital if the UK is to stay in the EU - after all, the European Commission would say it backs both. ""Free movement to take up work, not free benefits"" is more concrete and eminently achievable but may not look like the ""fundamental"" change in relationship that is promised. But ""new mechanisms in place to prevent vast migrations across the Continent"" looks much easier to declare as a ""win"" or ""lose"".After persistent warnings, particularly from German Chancellor Angela Merkel, that ""free movement of people"" was not up for grabs, the prime minister appeared to drop the idea. But he told the House of Commons only two months ago: ""In the coming two years, we have the opportunity to reform the EU and fundamentally change Britain's relationship with it. ""We have the opportunity to build a European Union that is more competitive, more flexible and more accountable to the people, where powers flow back to member states, not just away from them, and where freedom of movement is no longer an unqualified right.""How much would the EU have to qualify that right, to persuade the doubters?Would a promise to stop putative Serbians coming to Britain after their country joins, in perhaps 2030, do the trick? Again, that is unknown and uncertain.At the moment, most backbenchers are keeping their heads down and powder dry. But Jacob Rees Mogg, MP for North East Somerset and member of the European Scrutiny Committee in the last Parliament, told me: ""I think the touchstone for renegotiation will be the free movement of people. ""It is one of the four freedoms of the European Union, and if the EU is  willing to give ground on that it will show that it is willing to consider a fundamental reform rather than just tinkering at the edges. ""So it is symbolically important as well as representing a deep concern of the British people.""This is admirable in its clarity, and I suspect it will be a  touchstone too for many of his colleagues. Others may set the bar higher or lower, but one new MP told me: ""I wouldn't like to be in the prime minister's shoes.""He knows it has to be real - he can't just come back with a bit of polish on it."" The prime minister's challenge is to come back with a deal so bright and sunny that the snows of uncertainty melt away to reveal the sunny uplands of victory. Is that likely? Maybe."
2015-05-24,Peer problems?,https://web.archive.org//web/20150524033726/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32725118,"When David Cameron heads to the House of Lords for the Queen's Speech later this month he might want to cast his eye along the red benches. Sitting there will be scores of peers who - when the ermine robes are off and Parliament gets back to business - could start causing a bit of trouble for the government.Managing Mr Cameron's small majority in the Commons - 12 MPs - is going to require some skill from the party whips. But it could turn out to be an easy day at the office compared with handling the complicated mechanics of the Lords where the Conservatives aren't even close to a majority.The numbers - see below - don't add up for the prime minister in the ""upper chamber"".Together, Labour and the Lib Dems have 315 peers - enough to beat the Conservatives by 91 votes. Then there are the crossbench - or independent - peers to think about.  They're hard to predict as they don't vote as a block.  In the worst-case scenario for the Conservatives, their 224 peers are up against a whopping 555 from other parties and groups. On the other hand the crossbenchers could, in theory, help the Conservatives win.  As Professor Meg Russell, Director of the Constitution Unit at University College London, notes: ""The Conservatives are in a relatively weak position in the Lords, holding less than a third of seats. The government can readily be defeated by various combinations of other forces.""Policies that could stir up objections in the Lords include abolishing the Human Rights Act and legislation paving the way for an EU referendum. It's very unusual for peers to vote against an entire Bill. Their style is to go through legislation amending bits they don't like. The government can either accept the changes or overturn them in the Commons. Maybe David Cameron will start wishing he'd pushed on with plans, three years ago, to introduce elected peers. He abandoned the proposals in the face of opposition from Conservative MPs and peers. It was another reprieve for the House of Lords, which has survived numerous attempts at reform over the last 100 years.And there won't be another existential crisis for the time being. The Conservative election manifesto states that they see a ""strong case"" for introducing an ""elected element"" but ""it isn't a priority in the next Parliament"".With wounds to lick and new leaders to choose, Lib Dem and Labour strategists aren't thinking too deeply about their tactics in the  Lords. But as politicians drift back to Westminster the possibilities are starting to bleep on the political radar.Labour peer Lord Foulkes has already been tweeting about what he calls the ""difficult job"" facing the Leader of the Lords, Baroness Stowell, whose task is to get government business through.He predicts ""interesting times"", saying: ""Labour and the Liberal Democrats have a huge majority over the Conservatives. The crossbenchers are unpredictable but on a number of occasions they have come with us. The Lib Dems in the Lords are old-fashioned Lib Dems. They'll be happier working with us than the Tories.""The Liberal Democrats are leading lights in the campaign to turn the House of Lords into an elected chamber. It's a cruel irony that with only eight MPs, the Lib Dems will be relying on an institution they dislike to give them a solid platform at Westminster.How will they get along with their former coalition partners though? The Lib Dem peer, Baroness Hussein-Ece, said the Conservatives were now ""off the leash"" but wouldn't be getting ""an easy ride"".""The dynamics are going to be completely different. We will take things on a policy-by-policy basis. I feel quite passionately about keeping the Human Rights Act and I'm pretty sure that my colleagues will be opposing abolition vociferousIy.""But David Cameron can take some comfort from the fact that the Lib Dems will not be falling into Labour's arms. Baroness Hussein-Ece is certain there will be issues the two parties can agree on but is equally sure they will not form a happy union as a matter of course. She said: ""I'm afraid that the Labour Party is more interested in tribal politics. It could have conducted itself in a more progressive way during the election."" In the last Parliament, the coalition government was defeated 103 times in the Lords and a Labour source in the Lords predicts that the Conservatives will ""want to make up for lost time"". He said: ""What we anticipate is that they will start to look back at the concessions they made and the opposition amendments that got through.""And the feeling is that the government will find ways to use secondary legislation - which empowers ministers to adjust some laws.By convention, the House of Lords is reluctant to challenge policies promised in election manifestos and doesn't vote against measures on taxation and spending. But Professor Russell thinks the rules around those conventions are ""far from clear"" and that Labour and the Lib Dems might be tempted to block what they see as Conservative ""austerity"" measures. Meg Russell says: ""The House of Lords is a complicated place. Historically at least, they have always been very sensitive to public opinion. They are not likely to go in all guns blazing.""How can David Cameron deal with trouble in the Lords - even if it is well-meaning and principled?He can't get rid of any peers but he could, in theory, create a huge number of new Conservative peers to give him a stronger base. ""There are no rules,"" Meg Russell adds of the possibility. ""The prime minister has complete patronage. But of course it wouldn't go down well with the  public and there would be an outcry in Parliament.""And introducing too many new peers would also be embarrassing because the Conservatives have promised to tackle the size of the chamber. With 779 active members, it's one of the largest in the world.The Conservative Lord Cormack thinks that the prime minister shouldn't worry too much because he can rely on the Lords to behave ""with a considerable degree of sense"".""There will be stormy patches and it's always over the things that you don't predict,"" he says. ""But the important thing to do is play to the strengths of the Lords. There's an enormous accumulation of wisdom and experience. It generally improves bills."" He is relaxed about the next few years. ""I don't anticipate any unpleasantness. For the government to be defeated in the House of Lords isn't the end of the world."" And that's because, he said, the Lords believes in the supremacy of the Commons.It may be a while before the new dynamics in the Lords play out. The first bills will be unveiled in the Queen's Speech on 27th May and any controversial ones may not reach the House of Lords until after the summer break.But there's one other constitutional niggle to mention. In theory, all parties should be represented in the House of Lords - even the small ones. The Greens have one peer and UKIP has three. But there are no members of the SNP in the House of Lords. And with 56 MPs, it means the Lords isn't speaking for millions of people in Scotland. The SNP is adamant, though, that it doesn't want anything to do with the place.With the Lords potentially a powerful force, are the Scottish Nationalists missing a trick?Not according to the SNP MP Pete Wishart who declared: ""It's an affront to democracy. We will have nothing to do with this democratic outrage. The House of Lords doesn't need reform. We need to abolish it and start again."""
2015-05-24,Olive branches or burning bridges?,https://web.archive.org//web/20150524033726/http://www.bbc.com/news/education-32796618,"When Nicky Morgan became education secretary last year her biggest strength and biggest problem were the same thing - not being Michael Gove.Her predecessor had cast a long shadow, having dominated the education landscape and in many ways re-made it in his own likeness.Mrs Morgan was introduced as a less confrontational figure, offering an olive branch to a teaching profession that had felt that it was being used for target practice.But many of the questions she faced were about how she defined herself against the Gove legacy, rather than about her own vision.Now she is back under her own steam, authority enhanced and able to stamp her own identity on the Department for Education.So what will be the direction of schools in England under Mrs Morgan? Will it be more olive branches? Or will it be more burning bridges?The first education bill of the new Parliament promises to create hundreds of academies and free schools, with plans to replace the leadership of schools that are struggling. So no surprises there, it's going to be more of the same.And it will raise the same questions about whether structural change really raises standards.But so much of this debate is about the rhetoric rather than the reality - and head teachers have been bristling at the language of threats to send in teams of new leaders to ""failing and coasting schools"".Heads' leaders have been irritated that the public discourse is already so negative.And they ask where are all these armies of superstar replacement heads waiting to be ""parachuted"" into schools?The ""coasting school"" motif really irritates them, not least because it's such a vague term, leaving many heads unsure whether they should be looking over their shoulder.But maybe they should see it as part of the cycle of government.""Hundreds of schools in England which are considered to be 'coasting' are facing a government crackdown."" This was a story from 2007, with an almost identical threat of such lacklustre schools being taken over.And it wasn't even new then. ""The school standards watchdog in England is to crack down on 'coasting' schools"". That was from 1999 - and it annoyed head teachers then too.It's also worth noting that Ofsted at the same time announced that schools would only receive from six to 10 working weeks' notice of an inspection, instead of two terms. It's now less than one day's notice.And schools are still ""coasting"".One of the balancing acts for Mrs Morgan will be how to keep school leaders on board, as serious professional partners, when at the same time the political language about education often reverts into accusations and threats.Heads say they are facing big practical pressures in the next five years - hundreds of thousands of extra pupils needing places, fears of a shortage of teachers and head teachers, and worries about over-stretched budgets.Constantly talking about academies seems an ideological sideshow to them.And the engagement of heads will be crucial in what is going to be a major task for the next five years - rolling out the curriculum and qualifications reforms announced under the previous coalition government. There are bound to be some unforeseen bumps, and downright craters, in this delivery phase.Mrs Morgan has promised that the next five years will see an end to ""constant change"". There was a strong message to teachers during the election campaign that there would be more bedding in and less uprooting.And that means finding a way to avoid any more headline-grabbing changes, without looking like this is an administration that is becalmed. She'll have to show that less is more.But there are still questions to be decided which will be seen as symbolic. Not least about whether to allow a Kent grammar school to open a satellite branch in another town.Speaking privately, heads' leaders say there seems to be a balancing act.Mrs Morgan is described as being much more accessible and wanting a better relationship with the teaching profession - and the atmosphere in the Department for Education is described as ""completely different"" than in the Gove era.They describe ministers as being ""very upbeat"".But head teachers still bridle at what seems to be a very different political tone, that they criticise as negative towards schools, lacking in evidence and counter-productive.Good cop, bad cop? Mrs Morgan now has the chance to establish her own classroom style."
2015-05-24,New-look Commons,https://web.archive.org//web/20150524033726/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32795139,"MPs are back at Westminster to be sworn in as the new Parliament gets under way. But what's new this time around? Here are some things to look out for:Television viewers will get a new perspective on our politicians, thanks to eye-level cameras in the Commons. Approved by the House of Commons Commission in February, the cameras offer an alternative to the traditional high-level fixed positions to which viewers have become accustomed over the years. It comes after TV cameras were allowed into previously forbidden parts of the Palace of Westminster for the BBC's Inside the Commons documentary.The number of women in Parliament has risen by about a third to 191. Female MPs now make up 29% of the overall total. The proportion of female Conservative and Labour MPs has increased, despite an overall fall in the number of Labour MPs. But the biggest rise in female representation in the Commons came from the Scottish National Party, which now has 20 female MPs, up from just one.Labour MP Sir Gerald Kaufman is the new Father of the House, the title given to the MP with the longest continuous service who is not a minister.The member for Manchester Gorton replaces Conservative Sir Peter Tapsell, who stood down as MP at the election. His main duty, as demonstrated on Monday, is to preside over the election of a new Speaker.First elected in 1970, Sir Gerald pips three other MPs - Conservatives Ken Clarke and Michael Meacher, and Dennis Skinner of Labour, who all entered Parliament on the same day - because he swore the oath before them.Labour's acting leader Harriet Harman appointed herself to the unofficial title after pointing out she was the longest-serving female MP in the Commons. The MP for Camberwell and Peckham, first elected in 1982, made the comments during the Speaker's election exchanges, ""to prevent us all from falling headlong into patriarchy"" and promised ""good parenting"" along with Mr Kaufman.At 20 years of age, the SNP's Mhairi Black is the UK's youngest elected MP since 1667.The MP for Paisley and Renfrewshire South, who ousted shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander, found herself surrounded by Labour MPs on the green benches during the Speaker election. The politics student - who worked part-time in a chip shop before winning her seat - has been studying for her final exams in the House of Commons of Library, she revealed in an ITV interview.The influx of SNP MPs has led to some competition on the Labour benches. This was illustrated during the Speaker election as Labour MPs found themselves displaced from their familiar spots when the nationalists arrived early to bag their places. But Labour veteran Dennis Skinner held on to his traditional seat on the front corner of the far opposition bench. The Bolsover MP was spotted wedged in next to the SNP's Chris Law. ""I only had half a cheek on, but I was there before them and I will be there when they are gone,"" he told the Mirror. There are said to be just 427 seats available for MPs, and backbenchers use their prayer cards to guarantee a spot.The Liberal Democrats have been hardest hit by the new seating arrangements, with their eight MPs positioned in a distant corner of the opposition benches. It's a far cry from the days of coalition, when the likes of Nick Clegg and Danny Alexander regularly fielded questions from the despatch box.Aside from the prospect of a new Labour leader grilling Prime Minister David Cameron, the SNP will also get two questions in the weekly Parliamentary showpiece because of its third party status. Moray MP Angus Robertson, the party's Westminster leader, will get the role previously filled by the Liberal Democrats before the coalition government.The new House of Commons is more ethnically diverse than ever, with 41 non-white MPs, up from 27. And for the first time, there is an MP of Chinese origin - Alan Mak, who represents Havant for the Conservatives.Stephen Kinnock, son of former Labour leader Neil, is now an MP for the party. So is Rupa Huq, the sister of former Blue Peter presenter Konnie Huq, and Tulip Siddiq, whose aunt, Sheikh Hasina, is the prime minister of Bangladesh.The new House has 32 gay, lesbian and bisexual MPs - more than in any Parliament in any other country. According to an analysis for the New Statesman, 13 of these are Labour, and 12 are Conservative.For the first time since 1885, there are no former prime ministers anywhere in Parliament. Labour's Gordon Brown stood down at the general election, and neither of his two predecessors, Tony Blair and John Major, took seats in the House of Lords.The elections aren't over in the House of Commons, where chairmen and women have to be voted in to lead most of the Commons select committees.The committees, covering subjects like home affairs, health and transport, have an increasingly high-profile role in holding the government to account, carrying out inquiries, taking evidence from witnesses and publishing reports. Some committees, like foreign affairs and culture, media and sport, are guaranteed a new name in charge because the former holder has left Parliament or been promoted to the government.One thing that hasn't changed, to some people's surprise, is the occupant of the Speaker's chair. John Bercow was re-elected unopposed when MPs returned after the election, despite efforts by the Conservatives to make it easier for him to be unseated at the very end of the last Parliament. Meanwhile, there will be at least one new deputy Speaker - Labour MP Dawn Primarolo stood down, and elections will be held for each of the deputy posts in the coming weeks."

2015-05-25,Sturgeon attacks UK spending cuts,https://web.archive.org//web/20150526221307/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32878559,"First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has used a speech in Edinburgh to attack the ""scale and speed"" of spending cuts planned by the UK government.Speaking ahead of the Queen's Speech, the SNP leader also reiterated her party's support for Britain's continued membership of the European Union. She made the speech on a visit to Heart of Midlothian FC's Tynecastle Stadium.She was joined by the Scottish Finance Secretary John Swinney.The pair also unveiled the Scottish Business Pledge which aims to promote ""fairness, equality and sustainable economic growth"".An ""alternative to austerity"" was the centrepiece of the Scottish National Party's successful general election campaign.In her first major economic speech since the election, Ms Sturgeon argued that the prime minister cannot ignore the democratic will of the Scottish people. She said: ""The result of the general election provides an opportunity and a challenge for the Scottish government. There is clearly an opportunity to ensure that Scotland's priorities are better understood. ""But there is also a significant challenge in working with a majority government at Westminster - many of whose policies we disagree with.""We will continue to oppose spending reductions of the scale and speed that the UK government has suggested. These would slow economic recovery and make deficit reduction more difficult - something shown by the impact of the cuts imposed after 2010.""Ms Sturgeon said David Cameron must either change his approach or find ways to lessen the impact on Scotland. She also said that business, employees and government needed to work more closely together to build a prosperous and cohesive society. The SNP leader again insisted that the UK should only withdraw from the EU if there was a majority in favour of exit in all four nations of the UK.She said: ""Since a referendum is now inevitable we will work to protect Scotland's interests in that referendum. We'll propose a double majority meaning that exit from the European Union would only be possible if all four nations agreed to that, something that would ensure that Scotland couldn't be forced out of the European Union against our will.""And during the run up to the referendum, the Scottish government will of course make a strong and positive case for staying in the EU.""The first minister also called on businesses to commit to paying the living wage and promoting fair practices as she launched a new industry code.Companies wanting to sign up to the Scottish Business Pledge must agree to pay the living wage to all direct employees over 18.They must also be delivering on at least two of the pledge's nine components, as well as committing to achieving the rest ""over time"". Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme, Scottish Finance Secretary Mr Swinney, said: ""This has been described by the first minister as a shared national endeavour and I think that's exactly how we should look at this - government and business coming together.""My priority is to get people into employment and then to make sure that as much of that employment as possible is high quality, productive employment, making a high-value contribution to our society.""Hearts, who recently won promotion back to the Scottish Premiership, are one of the first companies to sign up to the pledge. The club's chief executive Ann Budge said: ""By introducing the living wage across our business, by investing in youth education and staff education, by engaging fully with the community and by working closely with the Foundation of Hearts to introduce fan ownership, we are the perfect match for this initiative.""Businessman Brendan Burns, who operates a forestry company and is a former UK policy chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, told Radio Scotland's Kaye Adams programme that the Scottish government needed to address more than just the implementation of the living wage.He said: ""I pay more than the living wage, but that is not the point. To be able to pay the living wage, you have to get more efficiency into Scottish businesses.""At this moment, that is what we don't have. Every businessman I meet will always say 'I would like to pay the living wage', but you can't pay out of a business if the profit isn't there. The profit is there when the business is more efficient.""Scottish Conservative enterprise spokesman Murdo Fraser MSP said many firms could not afford to pay the living wage and more incentives should be offered to businesses.""In principle, the Scottish Business Pledge sounds like a decent strategy,"" he said.""However, scratch beneath the surface and it would be realistic to say that many small to medium-sized business cannot afford to pay staff the living wage. This is particularly the case in sectors like care where income levels are set by the state.""The Scottish government should be helping these businesses where they can. That's why we're calling for a living wage business bonus for small businesses which pay the living wage, in the form of a reduction in their business rates.""The Scottish Greens welcomed the new pledge but urged the first minister to go further and address environmental standards and tax avoidance. MSP Patrick Harvie MSP said: ""Given the clear opportunity Scotland has to develop a low-carbon economy that respects our finite resources, and the urgent need to meet our failed climate targets, it's disappointing that the environmental impact of business is barely mentioned in this pledge scheme."" ""Ministers are also missing the chance to make a strong statement that tax dodgers won't be tolerated. """

2015-05-25,UK 'will not accept migrant quotas',https://web.archive.org//web/20150526221307/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32885662,"The UK will not be part of any EU plan to relocate thousands of African migrants who have arrived in Italy and Greece, the international development secretary has told the BBC. Justine Greening said the government will not accept mandatory quotas.The European Commission is expected to announce details of its plan to deal with the migrants on Wednesday.Reports suggest it will call for a quota system for member states to relocate some 40,000 asylum seekers.The UK has an opt-out which it has previously said it would use.Many of the migrants arrived in southern Europe by boat in recent months. The plan to use quotas to resettle those who have made it to Europe has caused controversy among several EU countries, including France and Spain.Ms Greening told the BBC: ""We don't accept having mandatory quotas or mandatory resettlement programmes. ""Our concern is that approach simply ends up acting as a pull for more migrants to make, what for many of them is a life and death decision to get on a boat that may not be sea worthy and over the past year 5,000 migrants have died at sea.""She said looking at why people were making the journeys was key.""If you look at what is driving people to start these journeys in the first place, it's the hope of a better life,"" she said.""And that's why the only real answer in the long term is to work together, as the international community, to tackle what is an international problem and to work together to deliver development and to level up the world so that we don't leave anyone behind, or leave anyone living in poverty in the future, as is happened in the past.""The issue was catapulted to the top of the EU agenda after hundreds of people were believed to have drowned when a boat carrying up to 700 migrants capsized in the Mediterranean Sea in April.The UN estimates that 60,000 people have already tried to cross the Mediterranean from North Africa this year.More than 1,800 migrants have died - a 20-fold increase on the same period in 2014.The UK has deployed a warship - HMS Bulwark - and search and rescue helicopters to the waters between Libya and Italy."
2015-05-25,Ex-MP Bruce: Politicians tell lies,https://web.archive.org//web/20150526221307/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32881672,"Politicians tell ""brazen lies"", senior Lib Dem Sir Malcolm Bruce has claimed as he defended the actions of ex-Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael. Mr Carmichael is facing calls to resign after admitting he backed the leaking of a memo during the election campaign incorrectly suggesting Nicola Sturgeon wanted David Cameron as prime minister.The MP for Orkney and Shetland said previously he had not been aware of it.Sir Malcolm said the MP had been wrong but lying was common in public life. The SNP have called on Mr Carmichael - the only remaining Lib Dem MP in Scotland - to consider his position after an official Cabinet Office inquiry found he approved the leak of an official memo by his special adviser to a newspaper during the campaign.The document, written by a civil servant in the Scotland Office, claimed the Scottish First Minister told the French Ambassador to the UK that she would prefer Mr Cameron as prime minister rather than Ed Miliband - comments Ms Sturgeon has always insisted she never made. At the time, Mr Carmichael said the first he had heard of the memo was when he was contacted by a journalist. He has since acknowledged that while he had not seen the document before it was published, he was aware of its content and agreed that it should be made public.The parliamentary standards commissioner has said she has received a number of complaints about Mr Carmichael's conduct and is considering whether they fall within her remit.The BBC's Tim Reid said Mr Carmichael was not an MP at the time of the episode - because parliament had broken up for the general election - but he was campaigning to retain his seat and remained a cabinet minister. A member of the public has also complained to the police about Mr Carmichael's conduct, our correspondent added. Sir Malcolm said Mr Carmichael had faced up to the consequences of his actions, having apologised and foregone the severance pay he was entitled to after losing his Cabinet position.But he told the BBC that it was ""perfectly reasonable"" for him to remain as a ""first-class"" MP for Orkney and Shetland. ""Alistair has recognised that he has made a mistake,"" he told Radio 4's Today programme. ""People are entitled to make mistakes, learn from them and move on.""Sir Malcolm, who was MP for 30 years until retiring at the election, said Scotland was a ""divided and bruised"" country after the election and that Mr Carmichael, as one of only three non-SNP MPs elected to Westminster, had a key role to play in representing his constituents and holding both the UK and Scottish governments to account.The SNP, he said, were ""judging people by standards that they do not apply to themselves"" and if Mr Carmichael quit ""what we will have seen is the SNP bully a very good MP out of office for a mistake he has acknowledged and apologised for"".""The SNP clearly want to extinguish all opposition in Scotland. That is their objective and they will stop at nothing to do it.""Asked whether it would be acceptable for an MP who had not told the truth to remain in office, he replied: ""I'm acknowledging that if (Mr Carmichael) has said 'I didn't know about something I did know in the heated atmosphere of an election campaign' that was part of the mistake, which he has apologised for.""""My point is if you are suggesting that every MP who has never quite told the truth or indeed told a brazen lie - including ministers, including Cabinet ministers, including prime ministers - we would clear out the House of Commons very fast, I would suggest.Asked if lying was widespread in public life, he said: ""No, well, yes. I think the answer is that lots of people have told lies and you know that to be perfectly true....He added: ""We should, of course, hold people to account and if people lie they should take some consequences but Alistair has taken consequences.""The SNP said the comments amounted to an ""increasingly desperate attempt to defend the indefensible"".""Being an MP or MSP is a huge privilege for anyone elected to serve - and untruthfulness can never be simply brushed aside in the way that Sir Malcolm suggests it should,"" said MP Pete Wishart.""The Lib Dems' defence of Mr Carmichael gets more ludicrous by the day, and all Sir Malcolm has succeeded in doing is to keep the focus on his colleague.""The Cabinet Office said the cost of its investigation had been ""minimal"" and said there were no plans for a further investigation into whether Mr Carmichael had breached the ministerial code.Labour MP John Mann said the row illustrated the need for a stronger system of voter recall for politicians accused of misconduct. ""There are plenty of people who avoid answering a question but that is not the same as lying,"" he said. Under a law championed by the Lib Dems in the last Parliament, an MP's seat becomes vacant if they are suspended from the Commons for at least 10 days and a 10% of their constituents subsequently sign a petition calling for a by-election. There has also been criticism from one prominent Lib Dem activist. ""It is a rubbish defence/excuse and not one a party reduced from 57 MPs to just 8 should be making,"" tweeted Stephen Tall, former co-editor of the Lib Dem Voice website. The Scottish Liberal Democrats have said that Mr Carmichael, who held off a strong challenge from the SNP to regain his seat by 817 votes, will not face any disciplinary action."
2015-05-25,PM and EC president hold reform talks,https://web.archive.org//web/20150526221307/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32877712,"David Cameron has told European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker that ""British people are not happy with the status quo"" in Europe. The prime minister hosted Mr Juncker at Chequers ahead of a week of efforts to renegotiate Britain's EU membership.The EC president ""reiterated that he wanted to find a fair deal for the UK"", said a No 10 spokesman after the talks.Meanwhile, Poland's prime minister told Mr Cameron she would not tolerate moves to ""discriminate"" against her country.Ewa Kopacz said it would be ""regrettable"" if the UK voted to leave the EU, and Polish people working in the UK contributed to economic growth and should be ""treated in the same way as others"".She is due to meet Mr Cameron on Friday.Mr Cameron and Mr Juncker's meeting came as reports suggest France and Germany are planning to announce further eurozone integration.French newspaper Le Monde is reporting that the two countries have agreed a deal to bring about closer political union between eurozone countries without the need for changes to the treaties which govern the EU. Mr Cameron has argued that treaty changes are needed to bring about the reforms he wants - creating a two-tier Europe, with closer integration between eurozone countries and Britain exempted from the drive for ""ever closer union"" between member states.The prime minister's call for tougher benefit restrictions on new migrants - expected to be a key demand in renegotiation talks - would also need to be agreed by all member states.The chances of getting a new treaty ratified in 28 countries by the end of 2017, in time for Britain to hold its planned in/out referendum, are remote, according to the BBC's Europe correspondent Chris Morris.But, he adds, member states have been allowed to change their relationship with the EU in the past and for those changes to be included in future treaties, something that could be presented as a treaty change by Mr Cameron ahead of Britain's referendum.The talks between Mr Cameron and Mr Juncker on Monday focused on ""reforming the EU and renegotiating the UK's relationship with it"", the No 10 spokesman said.  ""The prime minister underlined that the British people are not happy with the status quo and believe that the EU needs to change in order to better address their concerns.""Mr Juncker reiterated that he wanted to find a fair deal for the UK and would seek to help. ""They talked through the issue at some length in the spirit of finding solutions to these problems. They agreed that more discussion would be needed, including with other leaders, on the best way forward.""The two men also discussed the Greek economic situation, as well as Ukraine and sanctions against Russia, Downing Street added. Mr Juncker is opposed to treaty changes but Eurosceptic MPs argue it is not possible to have meaningful negotiations without them.Conservative backbencher, Bernard Jenkin, said the Le Monde leak ""went to the heart"" of what the prime minister's promised renegotiation was about. ""The treaties aren't designed to allow different states to do different things. It is all assumed that we will all be involved with integration,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.UKIP MP Douglas Carswell said before the meeting that the prime minister's promised renegotiation would be ""more or less worthless"" as it would not ""fundamentally change our relationship with Europe"". Over the coming days, Mr Cameron will travel to France, Germany, Denmark, Poland and the Netherlands to hold talks with European leaders.  Earlier, No 10 confirmed UK-based citizens from most EU countries would not get a vote in the referendum. The eligibility rules will be broadly the same as for a general election, rather than for local or European polls.  Legislation on the voting eligibility for the referendum will be introduced to Parliament via the EU Referendum Bill. It will say:A No 10 source said about the franchise: ""This is a big decision for our country, one that is about the future of the United Kingdom. That's why we think it's important that it is British, Irish and Commonwealth citizens that are the ones who get to decide.""Eurosceptics have previously claimed that as many as 1.5 million people from other EU countries could have been allowed to vote in the referendum, if it had taken place under the rules for local government elections.David Cameron is ready to start renegotiating the terms of Britain's EU membership ahead of a referendum.

Mr Umunna hopes to assume a prominent role for Labour within the EU referendum campaign.But he acknowledged concerns for the party, suggesting campaigning alongside Conservatives and too vociferously in favour of EU membership could make the party vulnerable to UKIP.There are 44 seats where UKIP is now in second place to Labour.""There is a degree of hesitancy on the Labour side when it comes to making the case for us to stay in,"" Mr Umunna said.""I think everyone is agreed that is where we are and that is our position as a party, but the extent to which we should put ourselves at the forefront of the campaign to stay in there is a degree of hesitancy.""There is a worry that what beset us after the Scottish referendum - where we were on the winning side of the argument in terms of the way the referendum went but we saw the fall out after - there is a worry that that same fate will beset the Labour party in parts of England.""He said it was a ""worry"" that this could hand seats to UKIP.Explaining why he ruled himself out of the contest, Mr Umunna said: ""The level of media attention and pressure… when it began to affect my girlfriend, her family and my family and we had reporters for example going to her family when they were in the middle of having their Sunday roast with her 97-year-old grandmother - I found that very hard to stomach.""He added: ""For once I thought in my life I'm going to put my family, my girlfriend, her family, put them first - and this is not the right time for me.""My heart wasn't really in it at that moment, particularly going through that experience.""There were no skeletons, no revelations, I have absolutely nothing to hide.""Asked whether he could ever withstand the scrutiny, he said: ""If I ever chose to do something like this in the future then I'd have a much better understanding of it, but what I would say is I hope that issue of standing for the leadership never presents itself in my political journey again, because there should not be a vacancy because we will have a Labour PM in place in 2020.""Never say never, but right now this is not the priority in my life… I wouldn't say it was impossible but I think it's quite unlikely""He also said Ms Kendall had been ""making all the arguments that I would have been making if I was still in the contest""."
2015-05-25,NI welfare reform bill fails to pass,https://web.archive.org//web/20150526221307/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-32894371,"Northern Ireland's controversial Welfare Reform Bill has failed to pass at Stormont. A majority of 58 assembly members voted in favour and 39 voted against. However, the bill failed to pass because the nationalist Sinn Féin and SDLP put forward an official petition of concern. This meant the bill, to make changes to benefits that have been introduced in the rest of the UK, did not get the necessary cross-community support. There were several mitigation schemes in the bill that would have lessened its impact. But Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness of Sinn Féin said: ""This is a time when the (Stormont) executive parties need to stand together to defend our public services, particularly in terms of health, education and welfare.""Green Party leader Steven Agnew also signed the petition.During the assembly debate, Finance Minister Arlene Foster warned that if the bill failed to pass, ""£604m of cuts would have to be made to vital, frontline public services, the services that the most vulnerable in our community need and rely upon"".The debate went ahead despite Northern Ireland First Minister Peter Robinson's admission to hospital with a suspected heart attack on Monday.DUP sources say the 66-year-old party leader is making good progress and has been given a full briefing on Tuesday's events at Stormont. The measure was designed as a way to safeguard minority rights in Stormont's power-sharing assembly. If a petition of concern is presented to the assembly speaker, any motion or amendment will need cross-community support. In such cases, a vote on proposed legislation will only pass if supported by a weighted majority (60%) of members voting, including at least 40% of each of the nationalist and unionist designations present and voting.Effectively this means that, provided enough MLAs from a particular community agree, that community can exercise a veto over the assembly's decisions.

2015-05-25,Right to buy 'to create more homes',https://web.archive.org//web/20150526221307/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32883463,"Every housing association home sold under the right to buy scheme will be replaced with a new property, minister Greg Clark has promised.Some 1.3m housing association tenants in England are to get the right-to-buy their properties (the right to buy is being phased out in Scotland).Mr Clark said the bill, in Wednesday's Queen's Speech, would allow people to fulfil their home-owning aspirations.But critics say it will make the housing crisis worse.Council tenants have had the right to buy the homes they live in at a discount since the early 1980s.The scheme was given a boost in 2012, with bigger discounts and the then housing minister Grant Shapps promising that for ""the first time, every extra home sold will be replaced on a one-for-one basis"".But figures show that for 26,185 council homes sold through right-to-buy since 2012, only 2,712 replacements have started to be built, a rate of about one-to-10. Mr Clark, who has replaced Eric Pickles as the Communities and Local Government Secretary, said the last government's one-to-one pledge only applied to ""additional"" housing sold after the new discount was introduced and that the promised new homes would eventually be built.""The object of that policy was not to replace the whole of the stock. This new policy is to replace it,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.""The other thing to point out in terms of the last policy is housing associations and councils had three years to replace the stock that was sold and so there is a lag and some of those properties are now being built.""The policy we're announcing in the Queen's Speech is very clear - every property that is sold will be replaced, one-for-one, so the housing stock is being expanded and people can achieve this aspiration that most of us want, to own our home.""He added: ""Just because you've signed a social tenancy doesn't mean you should be signing away your aspiration to own a home.""Labour said it supported ""people's aspiration to buy their own home"" but the Conservatives' numbers ""don't add up"".Shadow housing minister Emma Reynolds said: ""Ministers have not set out how this policy will be paid for, and housing experts have said that the plan is unworkable, unfunded and will lead to fewer affordable homes.""Greg Clark said today that every home will be replaced but it was clear he didn't even know his own policy when he said there was no requirement to replace homes under the existing policy.""The government made the same commitment in the last Parliament - and failed miserably with only one home started to be built for every 10 homes sold. Nobody will believe their promises now.""Henry Gregg, of the National Housing Federation, which represents housing associations, warned the government it could not ""take assets away from charities and independent organisations that are trying to solve the housing crisis"".He told the BBC News Channel attempting to replace properties that had been sold off - even if the one-to-one target was met - would not address the housing shortage and would be like ""filling a bath with the plug taken out"".""There's 11 million private renters out there and there's also three million adult children living with their parents.  ""Giving the right to buy to housing associations is not going to help those people and actually if there's £4.5bn available which the government says there is, we shouldn't be spending that on giving large discounts of £100,00 to a privileged few, we should be actually be building more homes for all of the private rented sector and people who are living at home with their parents for example."""

But the scale of the defeat, the complexity of the lessons and the huge task of holding things together while we rebuild requires a unifier - someone who can work across the political breadth of the party and with the unions.""He added: ""Our new leader must be able to give their total attention to establishing themselves and re-establishing Labour with the country. ""Labour's internal affairs have to be left largely to others but their deputy must be much more than a party manager and motivator.""Mr Healey spent four years at the Treasury under Gordon Brown and was also a housing minister before becoming shadow health secretary for a year from October 2010.He said he had been encouraged by colleagues to add his name to an already-crowded field.To be on the ballot each candidate needs nomination from 35 MPs, but with only 232 Labour MPs in total, not all seven of those currently standing will reach that target.Mr Healey has already nominated Yvette Cooper for the party leadership.She is running alongside Andy Burnham, Mary Creagh and Liz Kendall."
2015-05-25,NI first minister still in hospital,https://web.archive.org//web/20150526221307/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-32873965,"Northern Ireland's first minister Peter Robinson remains in hospital after suffering a suspected heart attack.Mr Robinson, 66, was taken to the Ulster Hospital, Dundonald, on Monday morning after he became ill.The leader of the Democratic Unionist Party was then transferred to Belfast's Royal Victoria Hospital (RVH) where he underwent a procedure.On Tuesday morning, his party colleague Arlene Foster said she understood his condition had stabilised.The first minister's hospitalisation comes on the eve of a major debate at Stormont over welfare reform.A statement from the hospital said: ""Mr Robinson underwent a procedure this morning and is currently recovering in the RVH. ""He and his family have requested the need for privacy from this point onwards.""Mr Robinson has served as first minister and DUP leader since 2008, succeeding lan Paisley in both jobs.The DUP has asked that the Robinson family's privacy should be respected.Prime Minister David Cameron tweeted his best wishes to Mr Robinson, wishing him a speedy recovery.Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon also sent her best wishes.DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds said: ""My understanding is that he took ill during the night and was taken to hospital. ""He is undergoing tests. It is  very difficult to say at this stage what his current position is. ""Hopefully he will be back soon in his full job and will make a speedy recovery.""Nobody could have planned for this.However, talking to people within the DUP earlier today, the sense is that Mr Robinson's medical condition doesn't change what they said was a legally-driven deadline for the welfare reform bill.It's all tied up with their hopes of getting a budget through Stormont.It now looks like that welfare reform bill will be vetoed because both the nationalist parties have signed a petition of concern.But at this stage, the intention is that the Social Development Minister, Mervyn Storey, is to still go ahead with that debate.Meanwhile, one would assume another DUP minister might stand in for Mr Robinson as first minister.That said, he may be out of hospital relatively soon, but in terms of going back to his desk job one would think that he would need to take some time out.I don't think any kind of formal decision has been made, but we do know that there is a procedure within the Stormont rules that allows another minister to step in as acting first minister for a series of six weeks.The DUP previously used that during the investigation into the Robinson family and him stepping down to clear his name.Arlene Foster at that point stepped in so it's possible Mrs Foster could come in and do the same again.Other politicians including Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness, Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams, Ulster Unionist leader Mike Nesbitt,  SDLP leader Alasdair McDonnell, TUV leader Jim Allister and Mr Robinson's Stormont colleague Peter Weir have wished Mr Robinson a speedy recovery.Mr McGuinness tweeted that he was concerned to hear the news.""My thoughts and prayers are with him, Iris and family,"" he said.Mr Nesbitt said: ""I am sorry to hear that the first minister has been taken into hospital this morning and I wish Peter a full and speedy recovery. Our thoughts are with him and his family.""Presbyterian Moderator Michael Barry sent ""warm wishes"" to the first minister and his family in what he said was ""a worrying time"" for them.On Tuesday, the Northern Ireland Assembly is due to debate the final stage of the controversial Welfare Reform Bill.Speaking about the planned debate in light of the first minister's illness, Mr McGuinness said: ""We will have to wait and see what happens overnight.""Last week, Mr Robinson warned that the assembly could not survive the scenario which would unfold if the welfare reform bill was not approved.The Northern Ireland parties had agreed a deal on Westminster's welfare reform in the Stormont House Agreement last December.However, Sinn Féin withdrew its support for the bill in March.Sinn Féin and the SDLP have signed a petition of concern which means the bill appears certain to be blocked on Tuesday as it will not get the necessary cross-community support."

They spoke for 30 minutes, with Syria and Ukraine dominating, she added.""Both leaders agreed that it is in the interest of both the UK and Russia to help find a solution to the civil war in Syria and particularly to stop the rise of ISIL (Islamic State),"" the spokeswoman said. ""They agreed that their national security advisers should meet to restart talks on the Syrian conflict.""The men also agreed both countries should continue dialogue with the ""moderate Syrian opposition"" in the quest for a solution, Downing Street said. On Ukraine, the prime minister felt there remained ""deep differences"" over Russia's role in the country, the spokeswoman said, ""but that the priority now must be to deliver full implementation of the Minsk agreement.""In February, marathon talks in Minsk resulted in a plan for peace in Ukraine.The spokeswoman added: ""The prime minister concluded the call by noting that the UK and Russia had worked successfully together on the Iranian nuclear issue and he hoped that in the years ahead, we could find other issues where the UK and Russia could work together on matters of mutual interest.""Russia's actions in Ukraine and incursions into Western airspace have led to rising tensions with the West.The conversation came as Russia's military forces began a large-scale military exercise aimed at testing its combat readiness.Around 250 aircraft and 12,000 service personnel are involved in the four-day drill, which Russia's defence ministry called a ""massive surprise inspection"".

And who is vying for the deputy leader job?Shadow health minister Liz Kendall was the first Labour MP to say they wanted a crack at the party's top job, saying a ""fundamentally new approach"" was needed.First elected to Parliament in 2010 as MP for Leicester West and appointed to the shadow front bench the same year, Ms Kendall is seen as a Blairite contender.She is a former special adviser to Harriet Harman and then Health Secretary Patricia Hewitt who has argued for reform of public services.In an interview for The House magazine in January, she said there ""will remain a role"" for private and voluntary firms in the health service, ""where they can add extra capacity to the NHS or challenge to the system"".Could she be a fresh face to lead a change of direction for Labour, or seen as too inside the Westminster bubble?The Labour MP for Leigh since 2001, Andy Burnham has plenty of government experience and is the current bookies' favourite.Mr Burnham served as health secretary under Gordon Brown and previously as culture secretary and chief secretary to the Treasury.He stood for the leadership in 2010 but lost out to Ed Miliband, going on to hold the shadow health brief under Mr Miliband's leadership. He is said to have strong trade union support.Declaring his intention to stand, he said Labour must support the ""aspirations of everyone"".Another former chief secretary to the Treasury - as well as a work and pensions minister under Gordon Brown - Yvette Cooper has been shadow home secretary for the past four years.A strong Commons performer, she has given Home Secretary Theresa May a hard time over matters including passport delays, border controls and extremism.She did not stand to succeed Mr Brown in 2010, in favour of her husband, Ed Balls.Announcing her bid this time around, she said: ""Our promise of hope wasn't strong enough to drown out the Tory and UKIP voices of fear. That's what we need to change.""The shadow international development secretary has announced her intention to join the race for the Labour leadership, via an article in the Daily MailMs Creagh joined parliament in 2005 as the MP for Wakefield, gaining experience in government as an assistant whip in 2009-10.She's also held various shadow cabinet positions in opposition, most notably as shadow secretary of state for environment, food and rural affairs - and transport.Ms Creagh held onto her brief as international development secretary in acting Labour leader Harriet Harman's recent reshuffle of the shadow cabinet.Rushanara Ali announced her intention to run for Labour's deputy leadership claiming the party had become ""unelectable"".She was first elected in 2010 in Bethnal Green and Bow, defeating incumbent MP George Galloway. She served as shadow education minister until September last year, when she resigned from the party's front bench in order to abstain in the vote on air strikes against Islamic State extremists in Iraq.On the future direction for Labour, she said the party needed to be ""radical"" and ""take risks"", adding : ""I think it's time for my generation to roll up their sleeves and get to work.""She says supporters of her campaign include shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt and former minister Keith Vaz.The MP for Don Valley has been Labour's shadow energy and climate change secretary since 2011, after a stint heading up the Department for Communities and Local Government.Ms Flint held on to her current position in the latest shadow cabinet reshuffle.She also held various ministerial positions during Gordon Brown's premiership, but famously resigned from as Europe minister after accusing him of treating her and her female colleagues as ""window dressing"".A former GMTV presenter, Gloria de Piero joined Parliament as the MP for Ashfield in 2010.She immediately rose to shadow ministerial ranks, taking on a culture, media and sport brief and then home affairs.Since 2013 she's been a shadow minister for women and equalities, being one of Harriet Harman's team on Labour's woman-to-woman ""pink bus"" campaign.The MP for West Bromwich since 2001. He has made a name for himself as a prominent backbench campaigner against phone hacking and child sex abuse.He also played a minor role in the toppling of Tony Blair after resigning as a defence minister and calling for the-then PM to quit in the interest of party and country.Watson became Labour's campaign chief under Ed Miliband but he quit after a he became embroiled in a row about the role of the Unite union in the candidate selection in Falkirk.Setting out his pitch for the job, he said: ""I'm seeking the deputy leadership to do one thing: write and execute the election battle plan so that our new leader will be prime minister.""The Walthamstow MP has a growing reputation as a hard-working campaigning MP. Another from the 2010 intake, she was praised for campaign against payday loans companies, and has a strong following on social media.She told the Sunday Mirror: ""Too many voters think Labour is no longer a movement for social justice but a machine that only kicks in to gear at election time.""Shadow environment secretary Angela Eagle plans to travel the country to speak to people who did the ""hard graft"" in the election campaign.The MP for Wallasey said Labour could not be ""complacent"" if it was to reverse its general election defeat.Ms Eagle, an MP since 1992, held a number of ministerial jobs during the last Labour government and in 2013 became chair of the Labour Party.She is arguably best-known for having a twin sister, Maria, who is also a Labour MP.A former journalist and Labour cabinet minister, Ben Bradshaw has been the MP for Exeter since 1997.He plans a ""big tent"" approach to ensure Labour does not miss out on votes in the south of England, saying the party has to ""broaden its appeal"".Reflecting on who should replace Ed Miliband, he said: ""I would prefer to see one of the new generation come forward rather than someone associated with the Blair and Brown era.""If we really want to win in 2020 - and I think we need to for the country's sake -  I would like to see someone from the new generation without that baggage from the past.""The MP for Tottenham was the first person to publicly weigh up a leadership bid, telling the BBC that he would consider standing if colleagues wanted him to.But he's ruled himself out of the top job, saying his principal aim is to become Labour's candidate for Mayor of London in 2016.""I think we need a leader that can win back the Midlands understand Scotland as well as the south.""Actually we need to do better in London, my strengths are in London and the south therefore I want to be the Labour candidate for Mayor,"" he told the BBC's Daily Politics programme.One of the most prominent black MPs in the party, the former former barrister is regarded as being on the right of the party, having served as a minister under both Tony Blair and Gordon Brown.His national profile rose during the 2011 riots in London, when he appealed for calm and reconciliation in the wake of the fatal shooting of Mark Duggan in his north London constituency. Dame Tessa Jowell was a key figure at the heart of New Labour - she once said she would ""jump under a bus"" for Tony Blair.The former Dulwich and West Norwood MP, who stood down at the general election after 20 years in Parliament, earned widespread plaudits for the role she played in London's bid for the 2012 Olympics and her subsequent performance as Olympics minister.She has vowed to bring ""Olympic-like discipline"" to changing London, promising to build more affordable homes.The former culture secretary, who was a psychiatric social worker before entering politics, is seen as one of the frontrunners in the race to be Labour's mayoral candidate, with one poll suggesting she is backed by 40% of Labour supporters.Sadiq Khan launched his bid to be London mayor with an attack on incumbent Boris Johnson, describing him as a ""red carpet mayor, somebody who is fantastic going to openings, great with a flute of champagne in his hands"".""I'd rather roll up my sleeves and fight for all Londoners,"" he added.The son of a bus driver, Mr Khan worked as a human rights solicitor before becoming an MP in 2005. He is shadow London minister.A close ally of former Labour leader Ed Miliband, Mr Khan served in junior ministerial roles in Gordon Brown's government.A familiar face to viewers of BBC One's This Week, Diane Abbott is a veteran left winger who first entered the Commons in 1987, as one of Britain's first black MPs.The Hackney North and Stoke Newington MP was shadow public health spokesman under Ed Miliband, after losing out to him in the 2010 Labour leadership contest.Launching her mayoral bid, she said she would bring London's communities together and be the ""genuinely independently minded Mayor that London needs"".""Hard times call for a campaigning Mayor. Now more than ever our city needs a Mayor who will stand up for the interests of those increasingly left behind,"" she added.A journalist and railway historian, Christian Wolmar is one of Britain's most in-demand transport pundits.The only non-politician in the race, he campaigns against the construction of HS2 and has vowed to tackle London's ""housing crisis"", improve the transport network and revitalise public spaces.""Instead of partisan and personality politics London needs a dedicated, ideas driven mayor who works for Londoners and their needs,"" he said.The 65-year-old cycles to campaign meeting and claims to have clocked up more than 2,000 miles already.Chuka Umunna was the second candidate to declare he would stand for election as leader of the Labour Party.A rising star of the party, Mr Umunna was first elected to Parliament in 2010 and appointed shadow business secretary the following year.He has retained the seat of Streatham with a majority of nearly 14,000 and a vastly increased vote share this time round.He announced his intention to stand via a post on his Facebook page. He said he had spoken to half the Labour 80 candidates standing in Tory seats targeted by the party and other MPs before making his announcement. However, three days later Mr Umunna withdrew from the leadership contest. He said in a statement posted on his Twitter feed that had been uncomfortable with the level of ""sheer pressure"" and scrutiny that came with being a candidate.The 36-year-old added that it had perhaps been ""too soon"" for him to launch a leadership bid.Another rising star of the 2010 intake, the MP for Leeds West was appointed shadow chief secretary to the Treasury in 2011 and shadow work and pensions secretary in 2013.During the election campaign, she attacked the so-called bedroom tax, whereby housing benefit payments are reduced for tenants in council and social housing deemed to have spare rooms.However, she also suggested Labour would consider reducing the overall welfare cap in some areas.She told BBC News Labour needs ""to be in the centre ground to win a general election"" but ruled herself out of a leadership bid.A former home secretary and shadow chancellor, Alan Johnson is the Labour leadership candidate who never quite was.The popular MP declined to stand in 2010 and stepped down from his shadow cabinet role in 2011 for personal reasons.Earlier this year it was reported that senior New Labour figures Lord Mandelson and Alistair Campbell approached Mr Johnson over a leadership bid, although all three later distanced themselves from the story.But the former postman, who has been MP for Hull West and Hessle since 1997, had seemingly ruled himself out again, saying it is a ""10-year job"" and he does not have the ""right qualities"". Former army officer Dan Jarvis was elected MP for Barnsley Central in a by-election in 2011, having resigned his commission as a major in the Parachute Regiment to contest the seat.He held onto his seat at the general election, taking time out from campaigning to run the London Marathon last month.After entering Parliament in 2010, he quickly became a shadow culture, media and sport minister and later a shadow justice minister.In 2011, Mr Jarvis became the first serving politician in more than 60 years to be awarded a military honour, when he was made an MBE for his services to the armed forces.He has been touted by some colleagues as a future Labour leader but Mr Jarvis, who was widowed in 2010 and has a young family, ruled himself out, saying it is not the ""right time"" for him and his family. Historian and journalist Tristram Hunt entered Parliament in 2010 as Labour MP for Stoke-on-Trent Central.Ed Miliband made him shadow education secretary in 2013 and he has been a fierce critic of the coalition's education policies in England.Speaking in the aftermath of the election results, he called on Labour's ruling National Executive Committee ""not to rush our election"", saying there was time for a ""brutal post-mortem"" about Labour's ""underlying philosophy and thinking"".As for his own ambitions, he said ""it's about the lyrics as much as the lead singer I think"".He later said he was not confident of getting enough nominations to stand, and would support Liz Kendall.The MP for Rochdale says the deputy leader vacancy has ""come a bit too soon"" for him.He previously said a number of colleagues had asked him to put his name forward for the role.Mr Danczuk is well known for his prominent campaigning against child sex abuse and leading calls for an inquiry into allegations of historical child sex abuse by senior figures at Westminster.He was a vocal critic of Ed Miliband and in an article for the Daily Telegraph on Thursday he said Labour needed to ""step out if its Metropolitan comfort zone"" and ""reach out to the country once more.""The former director of public prosecutions has only just become an MP after being elected in Frank Dobson's old seat of Holborn and St Pancras, in North London at the general election.He was forced to rule himself out of the race to be Labour leader following a social media campaign urging him to stand.He said he was ""flattered"" by the campaign but the party needed someone with ""more political experience"".The older brother of ex-leader Ed, David Miliband was frontrunner to replace Gordon Brown in 2010, until his sibling beat him by a whisker.A former foreign secretary and MP for South Shields, he was the Blairite choice for leader but eventually quit Parliament to become head of the International Rescue Committee charity in New York in 2013.Speaking to the BBC from the US on the Monday after the general election, Mr Miliband criticised his brother's campaign in the 2015 general election, saying he and Mr Brown had ""allowed themselves to be portrayed as moving backwards from the principles of aspiration and inclusion that are the absolute heart of any successful progressive political project"".While he acknowledged the two men were ""brothers for life"", he also confirmed he was not eligible to stand for the party leadership as he is not an MP.Labour's election rulesMPs wishing to stand as leader and deputy leader have to be nominated by 15% of their colleagues in the Parliamentary Labour Party to be eligible to stand.As Labour now has 232 MPs, this means prospective candidates must get at least 34 signatures. That means the maximum size of any field is six contenders.Under rules agreed last year, all Labour Party members, registered supporters and affiliated supporters - including union members - will be allowed a maximum of one vote each on a one member, one vote system. When the election is held, they will be asked to rank candidates in order of preference.If no candidate gets 50% of all votes cast, the votes will be added up and the candidate with the fewest votes eliminated. Their 2nd preference votes will then be redistributed until one candidate has 50% of all votes cast."

2015-05-25,Round-up: BBC experts' analysis,https://web.archive.org//web/20150526221307/http://www.bbc.com/news/election-2015-32650417,"The political future of the United Kingdom has become clearer after the results of the general election emerged around the country.David Cameron says he hopes to govern for all of the UK after the Conservatives took 331 seats - enough to form a slender majority in the Commons.Labour has been all but wiped out by the SNP in Scotland and suffered a disappointing set of results elsewhere, while the Lib Dems are left with just eight MPs after many party heavyweights such as Vince Cable and Danny Alexander lost their seats.So with battles won and lost and the fall-out and celebrations beginning, BBC correspondents examine the implications and challenges that lie ahead for the new government - and for those whose political careers have been ended by voters.No pollster, no pundit, no political leader saw it coming - not even David Cameron himself.Governing parties don't gain seats. Parties that have implemented painful cuts and are promising more certainly don't. Until that is the Conservative Party did - achieving what had seemed to be Mission Impossible - a Tory majority.Until that is David Cameron's personal triumph which triggered the near simultaneous resignation of his three principle opponents - Messrs Miliband, Clegg and Farage.They did so in part because they helped to crush their partners in coalition these last five years - reducing the Liberal Democrat parliamentary party to a size when it can fit into two London taxis and still have two seats to spare.In part because the extraordinary tidal wave of support for the SNP swept dozens of once safe Labour seats away.In part because Nigel Farage persuaded millions to vote for him but secured just one seat - not, though, the one he was standing in.Read more from Nick Robinson hereThe question uppermost in the prime minister's mind as he assembles his new government is how to keep the kingdom united.""Above all I want to bring our country together,"" he revealed after the result, ""to reclaim a mantle we should never have lost - the mantle of one nation, one United Kingdom"".Looking at the political landscape from Land's End today is very different to the view from John O'Groats.A sea of Conservative and Unionist blue dominates the scene across much of England, while a field of SNP nationalist yellow stretches to the horizon and beyond from the north.David Cameron's greatest challenge is to prevent the union he supports being torn apart by mutual resentment - resentment from Scotland at a Westminster government dominated by English Tories, and resentment from England at the preferential treatment people think is being given to the Scots.Those who assumed the future of the Union had been safeguarded by the Scottish referendum must think again.Read more from Mark Easton hereOne thing is rock-solid true: the Conservatives who worked on this campaign are as surprised by the result as the pollsters, pundits, politicians and general population.Maybe they shouldn't be - the economy is in good shape and the Conservatives had incumbency advantage.But when I travelled back from the prime minister's last rally with a group of exhausted Conservative campaign officials it was clear that 290 seats was a hoped-for target.No-one talked about anything over 300 seats, and no-one even mentioned an overall majority.So what special sauce pushed David Cameron into No 10 with a Commons majority?Mr Cameron had two simple messages in the campaign and he rarely veered away from them; the first - the economy is in good shape and the recovery is threatened by Labour. And the second - the SNP would hold a Labour-led government to ransom.Read more from Jonny Dymond hereBrian Taylor, BBC political editor, ScotlandOf all the comments on the overnight apocalypse, undoubtedly the most straightforward came from a defeated Scottish Labour MP.Since there were quite a few of them, let me narrow the focus a little. Come on down, Tom Harris.Mr Harris had plainly anticipated defeat. Nonetheless, he looked suitably lugubrious as his fate was confirmed.Why, he was asked eagerly, had Labour lost? ""Because we did not win enough votes.""Psephologically, it is perfect. Complete in itself. Psychologically, it sums up Labour's gloom without descending into subsidiary matters such as leadership, strategy and the rest. As a forward-thinking strategy, it is ideal. Win more votes. Simple.Read more from Brian Taylor hereThis has been an election which may have more profound consequences than almost any in living memory.We now face a generational decision about our future in Europe, with an EU referendum in two years' time almost certain.There will also be serious questions about the future of the Union, following an SNP landslide that has turned Scotland into a virtual one-party state.David Cameron's victory also represents a colossal achievement.Only once before in recent history has an incumbent government increased its majority - and that was Mrs Thatcher in her prime in the 1980s.It is also a significant personal victory for Mr Cameron and a rebuff for those in his party who had become increasingly sceptical about his ability to win.But while it may represent a defeat for those Tories who saw this election as a potential opportunity to rid themselves of David Cameron, he must now govern with a wafer-thin majority.For the SNP, their stunning victory can only increase the pressure on Nicola Sturgeon to include a commitment to a second independence referendum in her party's manifesto for next year's Scottish elections.It is an election which has not just defied all the predictions of the pollsters and pundits - but which may yet prompt the most fundamental re-casting of British politics for a generation.Read more from Norman Smith hereAfter an extraordinary night, some brief conclusions:Read more from James Landale hereIs this the end of the union?That is the question many people will be asking this morning after the party which has fought for Scottish independence for 80 years swept to victory.The answer from the jubilant Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon is a firm ""No"".She insists that her MPs will speak for all of Scotland, not just for the 45% who voted for the country to leave the United Kingdom last September.In the closing hours of the most extraordinary election campaign which anyone in Scotland can remember, Ms Sturgeon turned to talk of ""legitimacy.""That will be her watchword in the coming days as she argues that the prime minister cannot ignore the democratic will of the Scottish people.Politically, Scotland and England this morning look and feel like very different countries.Read more from James Cook hereAfter weeks of chatter about an election too close to call, it wasn't that close at all.David Cameron will be continuing as our prime minister.So, what is all this likely to mean?A referendum on whether the UK stays in, or leaves, the European Union, within the next two-and-a-half years.A race to be the next leader of the Labour Party.A race to be the next leader of the Liberal Democrats.And a huge new presence of Scottish National Party MPs at Westminster.And so here's another thing we know for certain this morning: Politics ain't going to be boring any time soon.Read more from Chris Mason hereFor Labour the story of their terrible night is rapidly turning into the search for a new leader. So who will that be?Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, is almost certain to run.  Even before this election, both he and another almost inevitable candidate, Chuka Umunna, had raised eyebrows inside the party at the work they had put in, preparing the ground with members and the unions for potential bids.Yvette Cooper, before the election, was still thought not to have made up her mind over whether to run. That decision has been made perhaps a little easier as her husband, Ed Balls, has lost his seat.She is certainly potentially in the frame, along with two lesser known names - Liz Kendall and Dan Jarvis - two MPs who were only elected in 2010 for the first time. This could be their moment. But whoever is in the job, they face a monumental task.Read Laura Kuenssberg's Twitter hereSterling is up (the most for seven years against the euro), share prices are up (especially bank shares like Lloyds and RBS, and energy shares such as Centrica), government bond prices are up.To state the obvious, investors love the Tories' general election victory.There are a few reasons.One (no surprise here) is that Labour's threat of breaking up banks and imposing energy price caps has been lifted.Second is that investors have been discounting days and weeks of wrangling after polling day over who would form the government - and so they are semi-euphoric that we already know who's in charge.Third, many investors tend to be economically conservative and instinctively Conservative.But although the City may be a bit drunk on the result, its pleasure in Ed Miliband's and Ed Balls' humiliation may be making it a bit blind - perhaps dangerously so - to some bumps in the economic road ahead.Read more from Robert Peston hereNigel Farage dreamed of holding the balance of power, but in the end his UKIP party is now worse off than when it came into the election.At the seventh time of asking he was rejected - this time by the people of Thanet South. It was a similar story in Rochester and Strood where Mark Reckless, who sensationally defected from the Tories last year, was also sent packing.In seats on UKIP's target list, like Thurrock in Essex, the party failed to make gains. In Grimsby - where Mr Farage went twice in the last six weeks - they came third.UKIP got around four million votes - with especially strong showings in north-east and south-east England - but it's ended up with just one MP, and a vacancy at the top. This has led to UKIP attacking the current system of choosing MPs, which it's described as ""busted"" and ""dysfunctional"".In one sense, this campaign was a complete failure and it's left an aftermath of angry voters, and others wondering if the UKIP bubble has burst.Read Robin Brant's Twitter hereI monitored 91 GB-wide voting intention polls during the 2015 election campaign and found nothing in them to prepare me for the final outcome.The good news for the pollsters was that their share for the Lib Dems was pretty close, as were the shares for UKIP, the Greens and the catch-all category of Others.The bad news for the polling industry was that the crucial shares for Conservative and Labour were the ones where they came most adrift.When all the qualifications of margins of error are allowed, there did appear to be a systematic overstatement of the Labour share and an equally systematic understatement of the Conservative one.It is for the pollsters to decide whether to conduct a review of their performance but I trust they will avoid the initial knee-jerk reaction of the immediate aftermath of the 1992 polls debacle.This general election performance follows the performance of the polls in the 2014 Scottish referendum where the choice was simply binary and yet all the polls were out by between 4-6%.Something is wrong. A lot of us would like to know what it is.Read more from David Cowling hereThe words ""political earthquake"" have been translated into numerous European languages, making front page news across the continent.While Britons now examine the domestic minutiae of the election result, here in mainland Europe the vote means one thing: a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU. And that has the potential to create an earthquake of its own.The guardian of the EU treaties Mr Cameron wants to change - Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker - has said again he'd listen to what Britain's new government proposed.Read more from Katya Adler here"

2015-05-25,"EU referendum: What, when and why?",https://web.archive.org//web/20150526221307/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"The UK is set to have a referendum by the end of 2017 on whether or not to remain a member of the European Union.The Conservatives' election manifesto promised to hold a referendum (a nationwide vote) on whether or not the UK should stay in or leave the European Union. They won the election so it's all systems go.A referendum is basically a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part, normally giving a ""Yes"" or ""No"" answer to a question. Whichever side gets more than half of all votes cast is considered to have won.The European Union is an economic and political partnership between 28 European countries. It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, its own parliament and it now sets the rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things like mobile phone charges.The one thing we know for sure is that Prime Minister David Cameron has said it will happen by the end of 2017. The most likely times of the year for referendums are generally May or September, and some people think it should be held as soon as possible - possibly even in May 2016, to coincide with elections in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and London, rather than waiting for 2017. When David Cameron announced in January 2013 his pledge to hold a referendum, a key element was that he would seek to make changes to the way the European Union works - or at least the rules covering the UK as a European Union member. Only once this renegotiation of British membership had been completed would he put the new arrangement to the public vote.During the election the Lib Dems and Labour both said they did not want a referendum unless there were plans to transfer more powers from the UK to the EU. Labour has since dropped its opposition, so the Conservatives are expected to get their Referendum Bill passed easily. The House of Lords could delay it, but as the referendum was promised in the Conservative election manifesto (a manifesto is a document setting out what a party would do if they won the election) it is not likely to reject the bill once MPs back it.The question is always crucial in any referendum and there is already debate about what it should be. The 2013 suggestion from the Conservatives was: ""Do you think that the United Kingdom should remain a member of the European Union?"" Some people thought this phrasing leaned too far towards the status quo - the current state of affairs - and the Electoral Commission, which has to approve the question, said it was not clear enough and proposed:""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union?""Read more: Does the wording of a referendum question matter?British, Irish and Commonwealth citizens over 18 who are resident in the UK, along with UK nationals who have lived overseas for less than 15 years. Members of the House of Lords and Commonwealth citizens in Gibraltar will also be eligible, unlike in a general election. Citizens from EU countries - apart from Ireland, Malta and Cyprus - will not get a vote.Mr Cameron is not revealing the full details of what he wants from the other EU leaders ahead of negotiations - but he is expected to demand an opt-out from one of its core principles of forging an ""ever-closer union"" between member states. He will also try to get restrictions on welfare benefits - in particular, tax credits - for migrants and more powers to block or opt out of new EU laws.Read more: Q&A: What Britain wants from EuropeBritain had a referendum in 1975 shortly after it had joined the EU, or the Common Market as it was then called. The country voted to stay in then but there have been growing calls, from the public and politicians, for another vote because, they argue, the EU has changed a lot over the past 40 years, with many more countries joining and the organisation extending its control over more aspects of daily lives. David Cameron initially resisted these calls but in 2013 he changed his mind.About 33% of the British public, according to the latest opinion polls. The UK Independence Party, which won the last European elections, and received nearly four million votes, 13% of those cast, in May's general election, campaigns for Britain's exit from the EU. A fair number of Conservative MPs - and several Labour ones - are also thought to be strongly in favour of leaving.They believe Britain is being held back by the EU, which they say imposes too many rules on business and charges billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also want Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. They also object to the idea of ""ever closer union"" and the belief that the ultimate goal is to create a ""United States of Europe"".David Cameron wants Britain to stay in the EU, once he has got some powers back from it. He has so far refused to say whether he would start calling for Britain to leave if he does not get what he wants from the other EU leaders. The Labour Party, SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems are also in favour of staying in. Latest opinion polls suggest 45% of the British public agree with them.They believe Britain gets a big boost from EU membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argue, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also believe Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving.It depends which way you look at it - or what you believe is important. Leaving the EU would be a big step - arguably far more important than who wins the next general election - but would it set the nation free or condemn it to economic ruin? Here is a rundown of the arguments for and against.Big business - with a few exceptions - tends to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. The CBI president and BT chief Sir Mike Rake says there are ""no credible alternatives"" to staying in the EU. But others disagree, such as Lord Bamford, chairman of JCB, who says an EU exit would allow the UK to negotiate trade deals as our country ""rather than being one of 28 nations"". Many small- and medium-sized firms would welcome a cut in red tape and what they see as petty regulations, but a lot hangs on what deal Mr Cameron renegotiates. The British Chambers of Commerce says 55% of members back staying in a reformed EU.Find out more: Business for Britain wants big changes to the UK's relations with the EU and says the UK should be prepared to vote to leave if the changes are not achievedBusiness for New Europe is a coalition of business leaders who support the UK's membership of the EU and ""oppose withdrawal to the margins"".The Electoral Commission will be in charge of making sure it's a fair contest.  There will be official ""Yes"" and ""No"" campaigns, selected by the Commission, which will have to abide by strict spending limits. Anyone wanting to launch their own Yes or No campaign will have to register with the Commission if they plan to spend more than £10,000. They must be UK-based. The Commission says MPs should decide what kinds of organisations should be allowed to take part. Business groups, trade unions and pressure groups are all likely to want to have their say.There will also be rules to prevent organisations trying to get round the spending limits through multiple registrations. Political parties will also be allowed to campaign for the result they want to see.Anyone who runs an unregistered campaign will be limited to spending less than £10,000. The idea is to prevent wealthy foreigners, companies or governments trying to influence the outcome. The Electoral Commission has published preliminary guidelines.That is yet to be decided and will partly depend on what Mr Cameron achieves in his renegotiation of the terms of the UK's membership of the EU. He says he is confident he can get what he wants, in which case he would be expected to lead the ""staying in"" side. The highest profile supporter of leaving the EU is UKIP leader Nigel Farage, but there are likely to be other high profile politicians who support withdrawal - or, as with the anti-euro campaign a few years back, celebrities or business people could front an ""anti-politics"" campaign.Conservatives' election manifesto - including referendum pledgeTry these features:How to win a referendumWhat David Cameron wants from the EU negotiationsTimeline: Campaigns for a European Union referendumBusinesses give their views on a possible EU exit"
2015-05-25,What Britain wants from Europe,https://web.archive.org//web/20150526221307/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32695399,"David Cameron says he has a mandate to pursue EU reform following the Conservatives' general election victory. The PM, who will be hoping his majority government will give him extra leverage in Brussels, wants to renegotiate the terms of the UK's membership ahead of a referendum by the end of 2017. He has said he will campaign for Britain to remain in the EU if he gets the reforms he wants.Mr Cameron has said he does not want to reveal full details of his negotiating hand but he has given a broad indication, in a series of speeches and newspaper articles, of his priorities when he goes into talks with other EU leaders.These are: The prime minister has said Britain would resist any move towards a European Army and that he wants to free British police forces from EU interference. He has also ruled out Britain joining the euro.But he has placed less emphasis in recent years on demanding changes to EU social policy, such as the maximum 48-hour working week, agency workers, maternity leave and non-discrimination rules.The official UK government position is that a referendum will be held by the end of 2017 but Downing Street sources have said: ""If we can do it earlier we will.""There is speculation David Cameron is planning to hold the vote in 2016 to avoid a clash with French and German elections in 2017.The prime minister wants treaty change but even if the referendum was held in 2017 there may not be enough time to legally incorporate any reforms into a treaty and it would have to be done at a later stage.An early referendum would anger Eurosceptics who believe it would not allow enough time to make the case for exit or negotiate any meaningful concessions.""A rushed process would severely undermine the chances to secure a significant deal that both British business and voters could support and would waste the opportunity of a lifetime,"" Matthew Elliott, chief executive of Business for Britain told Breitbart London.The question is always crucial in any referendum and there is already a debate about what it should be. The Draft European Union (Referendum) Bill, published by the Conservatives in 2013, proposed this form of words: ""Do you think that the United Kingdom should remain a member of the European Union?""Some thought that leaned too far towards the status quo, encouraging a yes vote, and the Electoral Commission said it was not clear and direct enough. The watchdog proposed this form of words instead: ""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union?""The new Conservative government will attempt to repeal the Human Rights Act, which requires UK courts to treat the European Court of Human Rights as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. The European Court of Human Rights is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe (CoE), which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine.The freedom for people to move around Europe, enshrined in the EU treaties, works in parallel with the other three basic freedoms in the single market: freedom of goods, capital and services.It is likely to be a ""red line"" for other EU leaders, who do not want to see it eroded.Mr Cameron has steered clear of tackling it directly - for example by asking for an emergency ""brake"" on free movement, or a cap on numbers - focusing instead on reducing the incentive provided by welfare payments. In a speech last November, David Cameron set out measures to reduce the number of EU nationals moving to the UK.His main proposals were:Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission, has said he is ready to work with Mr Cameron to ""strike a fair deal for the United Kingdom in the EU"". The leaders of other EU nations have previously warned they are unlikely to support major changes to EU treaties to accommodate British demands. But Mr Cameron's general election victory may have given him extra leverage. ""The ball is very much in the court of the UK now,"" a senior EU official told The Guardian. ""It's up to the British to define what they want."" The key figure will be German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is very keen to keep Britain in the EU but has so far been unwilling to make major concessions to enable that to happen. There are fears that a ""pick and mix"" approach to EU treaties would undermine EU cohesion.Mr Cameron has said there is ""no doubt"" his planned reforms will require changes to the treaties governing the European Union. But this would require the unanimous support of all EU members, and may not be possible within the deadline he has set of a referendum before the end of 2017. Any attempt to change EU laws on free movement would meet fierce resistance from some EU nations, particularly Eastern European states. Mr Juncker has said free movement is non-negotiable.Mr Cameron may find it difficult to get unanimous support for his proposals for a four-year waiting period for migrant workers claiming UK benefits. East European EU members would be likely to oppose this, on the grounds that it would discriminate against their citizens.  Attempts to secure opt-outs for the City are unlikely to go down well with other European leaders.However, there are precedents for EU treaty changes to accommodate some countries' specific concerns - for example, the protocol attached to the Lisbon Treaty for Ireland.Mr Cameron has faced repeated calls to say whether he would campaign for Britain's exit from the EU in the referendum if he fails to get what he wants from the renegotiation process. All he has said is that he will ""rule nothing out"". Some Conservative MPs want Britain to leave the EU no matter what David Cameron manages to renegotiate. A larger group are likely to want more concessions than Mr Cameron has so far indicated he is prepared to demand.Senior backbencher David Davis, who was defeated by Mr Cameron for the Tory leadership in 2005, told the Daily Telegraph the majority of the 332 Conservative MPs want Mr Cameron to negotiate an ""opt-out"" power to stop individual EU laws from applying to Britain. The prime minister has said this would be ""impossible"" without Britain leaving the EU.Mr Davis claims as many as 60 Tory MPs would be prepared to rebel and vote for Britain's exit from the EU if the prime minister fails to deliver.Graham Brady, chairman of the Tory backbench 1922 committee, which represents backbenchers, has urged David Cameron to give all Conservative MPs, including ministers, a free vote in the EU referendum.In January, Mr Cameron warned that serving cabinet ministers would have to quit the government if they wanted to campaign to leave the EU if he had secured the reforms to it he wants.In the 1975 referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Economic Community, as the EU was then called, Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson decided to suspend collective responsibility because his cabinet was split on the issue. Ministers were allowed to vote with their consciences and campaign against each other. The majority of them, including Mr Wilson, joined the Yes camp, but left-wingers, such as Tony Benn, played a leading role in the No campaign. The Yes campaign won easily with 67% of the vote."
2015-05-25,UK and the EU: Better off out or in?,https://web.archive.org//web/20150526221307/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32793642,"David Cameron has promised a referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Union by the end of 2017. Here is a summary of the key arguments for and against British membership.If Britain votes to leave the EU, it will have to negotiate a new trading relationship with what would now be a 27 member organisation, to allow British firms to sell goods and services to EU countries without being hit by excessive tariffs and other restrictions.Better off out: Britain could negotiate an ""amicable divorce"", but retain strong trading links with EU nations, say those campaigning for Britain's exit. There are several potential scenarios:Better off in: An ""amicable divorce"" is a pipe dream, pro-EU campaigners argue. France, Germany and other leading EU nations would never allow Britain a ""pick and mix"" approach to the bloc's rules. Norway and Switzerland have to abide by many EU rules without any influence over how they are formed. Negotiating a comprehensive free trade agreement could take years and have an uncertain outcome. And if Britain went for a completely clean break with the EU its exports would be subject to tariffs and would still have to meet EU production standards, harming the competitiveness of British business.The run-up to the EU referendum is likely to be dominated by competing claims about how many millions of jobs will be lost or gained by Britain's exit. All such claims come with a health warning. Coming up with a precise figure is difficult as there is no way of knowing if threats by foreign companies to scale back their operations in the UK would come to pass or, indeed, how many jobs would be created by the reshaped economy that might emerge in the wake of an exit.Better off out: There would be a jobs boom as firms are freed from EU regulations and red tape, say those arguing for an exit, with small- and medium-sized companies who don't trade with the EU benefiting the most. In its recent paper, the EU Jobs Myth, the free market Institute for Economic Affairs seeks to debunk the claim that 3-4 million jobs would be lost if Britain left. ""Jobs are associated with trade, not membership of a political union, and there is little evidence to suggest that trade would substantially fall between British businesses and European consumers in the event the UK was outside the EU,"" it argues. ""The UK labour market is incredibly dynamic, and would adapt quickly to changed relationships with the EU.""Better off in: Millions of jobs would be lost as global manufacturers moved to lower-cost EU countries. Britain's large, foreign-owned car industry would be particularly at risk. ""The attractiveness of the UK as a place to invest and do automotive business is clearly underpinned by the UK's influential membership of the EU,"" said a KPMG report on the car industry last year. The financial services sector, which employs about 2.1 million people in the UK, also has concerns about a British exit. ""The success of the UK financial services industry is to a large extent built on EU Internal Market legislation. To abandon this for some untried, unknown and unpredictable alternative would carry very significant risks,"" said global law firm Clifford Chance in a report by think tank TheCityUK last year.Much would depend on the trade deals Britain managed to negotiate with the EU and rest of the world after its exit. The best-case scenario, according to think tank Open Europe, is that the UK would be better off by 1.6% of GDP a year by 2030. That is assuming the UK carried out widespread deregulation after its exit and managed to strike favourable trade deals. The think tank adds: ""A far more realistic range is between a 0.8% permanent loss to GDP in 2030 and a 0.6% permanent gain in GDP in 2030, in scenarios where Britain mixes policy approaches"".The Centre for Economic Performance, at the London School of Economics, says the worst-case scenario is a 6.3% to 9.5% reduction in GDP, ""a loss of a similar size to that resulting from the global financial crisis of 2008/09"". The best case, according to their analysis, is a loss of 2.2% of GDP.Better off out: Britain would regain full control of its borders. UKIP wants to see a work permit system introduced, so that EU nationals would face the same visa restrictions as those from outside the EU, which it says would reduce population growth from current levels of 298,000 a year to about 50,000. This would create job opportunities for British workers and boost wages, as well as easing pressure on schools, hospitals and other public services. Better off in: Britain might have to agree to allow free movement of EU migrants as the price of being allowed access to the free market. In any case, immigration from the rest of the EU has been good for Britain's economy. The UK's growth forecasts are based, in part, on continued high levels of net migration. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility says the economy relies on migrant labour and taxes paid by immigrants to keep funding public services.The UK's net contribution to the EU, taking into account the rebate, was £11.3bn in 2013. That is more than four times what it was in 2008. It is about the same amount as the UK government spends on transport every year.Better off out: The UK would save billions in membership fees, and end the ""hidden tariff"" paid by UK taxpayers when goods are exported to the EU, caused by red tape, waste, fraud and other factors. Better off in: The UK's contribution to the EU budget is a drop in the ocean compared with the benefits to business of being in the single market. Better off out: The EU is not as important to British trade as it used to be, and continuing turmoil in the eurozone will make it even less so. Even if Britain did not manage to negotiate a free trade deal with the EU it would not be as disastrous as EU-enthusiasts claim, argues economist Roger Bootle in his book The Trouble with Europe: ""It would place the UK in the same position as the US is currently in, along with India, China and Japan, all of which manage to export to the EU relatively easily."" The UK would be free to establish bilateral trade agreements with fast-growing export markets such as China, Singapore, Brazil, Russia and India through the World Trade Organisation. Better off in: The EU is the UK's main trading partner, worth more than £400bn a year, or 52% of the total trade in goods and services. Complete withdrawal from the EU would see trade barriers erected, with car exports to the EU, for example, facing a 15% tariff and imports a tariff of 10%.  ""The idea that the UK would be freer outside the EU is based on a series of misconceptions, that a medium-sized, open economy could hold sway in an increasingly fractured trading system dominated by the US, the EU and China; that the EU makes it harder for Britain to penetrate emerging markets; and that foreign capital would be more attracted to Britain's economy if it were no longer part of the single market,"" the pro-EU Centre for European Reform said in a recent report.Better off out: The UK would remain a key part of Nato and the UN Security Council and a nuclear power, with a powerful global voice in its own right. The Eurosceptic Bruges Group wants an end to the ""discredited"" principle that Britain acts as a transatlantic bridge between the US and Europe, saying the country should make self-reliance its guiding principle.Better off in: Stripped of influence in Brussels, Berlin and Paris, Britain would find itself increasingly ignored by Washington and sidelined on big transnational issues such as the environment, security and trade. America and other allies want Britain to remain in the EU. The UK risks becoming a maverick, isolated state if it leaves.Better off out: Britain would gain full control of its own borders, with migration in and out of the country regulated solely by British law. It would be more difficult for EU citizens to move to the UK, although those already living here are unlikely to be removed. Better off in: A lot would depend on what kind of deal was reached with the other EU nations. Britons may have to apply for visas to enter EU countries and those already living there may face integration rules, such as proving they can speak the language before gaining long-term residency rights. There would also be uncertainty for many EU workers now paying taxes in the UK - what benefits, if any, would they be entitled to?Better off out: The EU has limited power over tax, which is largely a matter for national governments. The exception is VAT, which has bands agreed at the EU level. Outside the EU, the UK would potentially have more flexibility.Better off in:  ""Tax avoidance and evasion will reach crippling levels as our economy becomes increasingly wholly owned by foreign multinationals that make tax avoidance in Britain central to their business strategy,"" argued the pro-European The Observer newspaper in an editorial.Better off out: It would be a major shot in the arm for British democracy as the Westminster parliament regained its sovereignty and reconnected with voters. The country would be free from the European Arrest Warrant and other law and order measures.Better off in: Britons benefit from EU employment laws and social protections, which would be stripped away. Withdrawal from the European Arrest Warrant could mean delays for the UK in extraditing suspects from other European countries; and the UK already has some opt-outs from EU labour law, including the Working Time Directive."
2015-05-25,First Queen's Speech,https://web.archive.org//web/20150526221307/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32815788,"All eyes will be on the Palace of Westminster on Wednesday as the Queen reads out the legislative plans of David Cameron's new government.It will be a chance for the first all-Conservative government for almost 20 years to set out its stall for the next five years. Here's how some other new governments have used their Queen's (and King's) speeches.The 1945 election marked a watershed in British history. The Conservative wartime leader, Sir Winston Churchill, was defeated by Clement Attlee's Labour Party.The state opening of Parliament, on 15 August 1945, came at the end of World War Two, on Victory in Japan Day.King George VI's speech was delivered in the House of Lords, which had been occupied by MPs since the Commons chamber was destroyed by bombs.""Echoes of great events in British history mingled with the rejoicings of victory when the House of Commons assembled this morning in St Stephen's Hall for the state opening of Parliament,"" the Times newspaper reported, noting that Churchill was cheered as he took his seat.""The continuing shortages in the supply of many necessaries, especially houses, food, clothing and fuel, will call for the same spirit of tolerance and understanding which the nation has displayed during the past six years of war.""Key services and industries were nationalised, and Attlee's government ushered in the welfare state and the National Health Service.  India was granted independence.The Attlee government changed the face of British society, creating a new social consensus that was to remain largely unchanged until 1979, but its majority was slashed in 1950 amid public frustration at continued austerity and rationing, and the following year saw Churchill return to power with a comfortable majority.Margaret Thatcher became the UK's first female prime minister, ousting Jim Callaghan's Labour with a 43-seat majority. During the campaign she had promised to cut taxes, reduce public spending and curb the power of trade unions.""My government intend to achieve a fair balance between the rights and duties of the trade union movement.""""Right to buy"" proved extremely popular, with about 1.5m homes purchased under the rules by 2003. It was seen as a major vote winner for the Conservatives in subsequent elections, and in 1985 Labour dropped its official opposition to the scheme.Critics said it contributed to a reduction in the number of available council homes.Meanwhile, Mrs Thatcher's battles with trade unions became one of the defining features of her premiership. Ultimately their power was reduced and membership plummeted.Many of the services nationalised under the Attlee government were privatised.Public spending was slashed, and documents released in 2009 revealed even some Conservative ministers were alarmed at the scale of cuts planned in 1979.Mrs Thatcher was prime minister until 1990, winning three general elections. The Conservatives won one further election and remained in power until 1997.On 1 May 1997, Labour's 18 years in opposition came to an end. Tony Blair's New Labour won a 179-seat majority - the biggest in its history - on a manifesto which not only promised no income tax rises, but also a pledge to stick to Conservative spending plans.""The central economic objectives of my government are high and stable levels of economic growth and employment, to be achieved by ensuring opportunity for all.""""These are only the first steps on a long journey,"" was the Guardian's verdict, adding that ""Labour begins that journey sustained by enormous national delight"".Business leaders broadly welcomed the decision to free the Bank of England, which had divided the Conservatives. The Bank's monetary policy committee continues to set interest rates.Labour got into hot water with its tobacco advertising ban, as it announced an exemption for Formula One and then had to return a £1 million donation from F1 chief Bernie Ecclestone.The Freedom of Information Act remains in place - although Mr Blair subsequently described it as one the biggest regrets of his time in office. The Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly were established after referendums.Labour went on to win two more general elections, with the 2010 election bringing an end to its 13-year tenure.After the general election left no single party in overall control of Parliament, the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats came together to form Britain's first coalition government in 70 years. The result was the coalition agreement, which would form the backbone of the government's legislative programme for the next five years.""Action will be taken to accelerate the reduction of the structural budget deficit.""Contrary to some predictions, the two parties remained together throughout the parliament.Civil liberties measures like scrapping ID cards proved more straightforward than issues where the two parties were on opposite sides of the debate, like the proposed move to the Alternative Vote system, which was resoundingly rejected in a referendum.The government went on to change the structure of the NHS - despite vocal opposition from Labour - and set out details of the HS2 rail line, with construction due to start in 2017.After sticking together for five years, the two parties experienced differing fortunes at the 2015 election - the Conservatives secured an unexpected majority while the Lib Dems lost all but eight of their MPs."
2015-05-25,Bill-by-Bill,https://web.archive.org//web/20150526221307/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32835622,"The Queen's Speech on 27 May will set out the the government's legislative plans for the parliamentary session ahead. What can we expect to feature?This is high up on the list of the government's priorities. David Cameron has promised to renegotiate Britain's terms of membership of the European Union and put it to a public vote by 2017 at the latest. To do this he'll need to publish a parliamentary bill to pave the way for a referendum - so it's a definite to feature in the speech.During the general election campaign, David Cameron vowed to introduce a law guaranteeing no rise in income tax rates, VAT or national insurance before 2020. He said workers already paid enough tax and he would focus on other ways of clearing the deficit, such as reducing the welfare bill and tackling tax avoidance. The PM has also pledged a law to ensure that ""no one working 30 hours on the minimum wage pays any income tax at all"". Writing in the Sunday Telegraph about his first 100 days in office, he said: ""It is a permanent measure to re-write not just the laws of this country but the values of this country. And it will be there as the centrepiece of the first Queen's Speech of my new government.""The government is promising a crackdown on illegal immigration, and has already set out a number of new offences to try to ""control and reduce"" migration to the UK. These include a specific offence of illegal working - with police given the power to seize the wages paid to illegal workers as the ""proceeds of crime"". Among other proposals being considered are new powers for councils to deal with unscrupulous landlords and to evict illegal migrants more quickly, while all foreign criminals awaiting deportation will be fitted with satellite tracking tags. It will also become an offence for businesses and recruitment agencies to hire abroad without first advertising in the UK - a policy which featured prominently in Labour's election manifesto - and a new enforcement agency will be set up to tackle what the prime minister called ""the worst cases of exploitation"".Home Secretary Theresa May has pledged to ban the use of police cells for the emergency detention of mentally ill people under the Mental Health Act. In a speech to the annual conference of the Police Federation in England and Wales, Mrs May also outlined plans to extend police-led prosecutions, overhaul the complaints system, and change the use of bail.We know that proposals to devolve more powers to England's cities will feature in the Queen's Speech. Chancellor George Osborne said as much in first post-election speech, in which he outlined his vision to give English cities powers over housing, transport, planning and policing. He said Greater Manchester - which will take on the powers when electing a mayor in two years - should become a blueprint for other large cities.The new business secretary, Sajid Javid, has said it will be a government priority to reform strike laws. Specifically, it is proposing to ban strike action from taking place unless 40% of all eligible union members vote in favour of industrial action. The government also wants to lift a ban on use of agency staff when strike action takes places. ""That's something we'll give more detail on in the Queen's Speech but it will be a priority,"" Mr Javid told BBC Radio 4's Today programme earlier this month.The Conservatives have said measures on work will be at the heart of their legislative programme, with David Cameron saying during the election campaign that the UK should aspire to ""full employment"". He has pledged legislation on ""day one"" of the new Parliament. Among the priorities will be a push to create two million more jobs and three million more apprenticeships over the course of the Parliament. The boost in apprenticeships is to be paid for by reducing the benefit cap from £26,000 to £23,000.The prime minister has pledged to bring in a bill to ""deliver better schools - with more radical measures to ensure young people leave education with the skills they need"". He said the legislation will ""include new powers to force coasting schools, as well as failing schools, to accept new leadership, continuing the remarkable success story of Britain's academy schools"". The Conservatives want to expand their free schools programme - which Labour opposes, with Mr Cameron committing to creating an extra 270,000 free school places by 2020. Another stated key priority of the Conservative government is childcare. Currently, all three and four-year olds in England are entitled to 570 hours of free early education or childcare a year, which works out as 15 hours each week for 38 weeks of the year. During the election campaign, the Conservatives promised 30 hours from 2017. The prime minister has also said he wants to introduce tax-free childcare for every child.The government has outlined plans for a bill to cut red tape for British business by at least £10bn and, for the first time, independent regulators will be expected to contribute to that target. The bill is also expected to propose a new Small Business Conciliation Service, to help settle disputes between small and large businesses, especially over late payment practices.The prime minister has pledged to include a bill on devolution which would be based on the cross-party Smith Commission agreement on Scottish devolution. The Smith proposals included giving Holyrood the power to set income tax rates and bands, as well as control over a share of VAT and some welfare benefits.The Conservatives have pledged to abolish the Human Rights Act and replace it with a British Bill of Rights. The Conservative manifesto says: ""This will break the formal link between British courts and the European Court of Human Rights, and make our own Supreme Court the ultimate arbiter of human rights matters in the UK.""The government is expected to bring forward a new bill to crack down on radicalisation. It will include new immigration rules, powers to close down premises used by extremists, and ""extremism disruption orders"". Mr Cameron has repeatedly stressed the need to confront and defeat the ""poisonous"" extremist ideology. The proposals are likely to encounter some opposition in the new Parliament on the grounds that some of the plans could infringe people's right to free speech, BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said.This was the bill that the Conservatives' smaller coalition partners, the Liberal Democrats, refused to back in the last Parliament. Current legislation expires in 2016 and will have to be renewed. So now the Conservatives are governing alone, they can bring back what opponents call the snoopers' charter. The previous plans proposed to extend the range of data communications companies have to store for 12 months. It would have included, for the first time, details of messages sent on social media, webmail, voice calls over the internet and gaming, in addition to emails and phone calls. Officials would not have been able to see the content of the messages without a warrant. Currently communications firms only retain data about who people send emails to, and who they ring.Housing was a hot topic during the general election, featuring in all of the parties' campaigns. One of the Conservatives' key pledges was an extension of Margaret Thatcher's Right to Buy scheme to 1.3 million housing association tenants in England - and the government has confirmed this will feature. Under the plans, housing association tenants will be able to buy the homes they rent at a discount. Communities Minister Greg Clark told the BBC the government wanted to extend the opportunity for people to own their home. There will also be help for first-time buyers, with 200,000 starter homes made available to under-40s at a 20% discount - another Conservative manifesto pledge.The Conservatives made several commitments on the NHS during the election campaign - and David Cameron used his first major post-election speech to focus on his plans for the health service in England. He has pledged to boost funding by at least £8bn extra a year by 2020 and to create ""a truly seven-day NHS"". The government is also promising to recruit 5,000 new GPs.David Cameron has pledged to implement ""as fast as I can the devolution that all parties agreed for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland"". Wales Secretary Stephen Crabb has said his officials were writing legislation to transfer further powers to Wales, so these could be included in the Queen's Speech.Could David Cameron throw a bone to his Conservative backbenchers and introduce legislation to repeal the law that bans fox hunting with dogs? The ban has been unpopular in many rural areas since its introduction by Labour in 2004 - and David Cameron has indicated he would like to undo it. Their manifesto stated that a Conservative government ""will give Parliament the opportunity to repeal the Hunting Act on a free vote, with a government bill in government time"".Legislation to introduce a blanket ban on so-called legal highs is expected to feature in the Queen's Speech. The proposal was included in the Conservatives' general election manifesto, which stated: ""We will create a blanket ban on all new psychoactive substances, protecting young people from exposure to so-called 'legal highs'."" A Home Office source told the BBC that the proposal would be enacted upon."
2015-05-25,The Queen's Speech,https://web.archive.org//web/20150526221307/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32816450,"The Queen's Speech is the centrepiece of the State Opening of Parliament, which takes place this year on 27 May. It is one of the highlights of the parliamentary year, full of both pageantry and political significance.What is the Queen's Speech?In a nutshell, it is a list of the laws that the government hopes to get approved by Parliament over the coming year. By convention, it is announced by the Sovereign in the presence of MPs, peers and other dignitaries in the House of Lords.The occasion marks the start of the Parliamentary year and has added resonance after a change of government, with the contents of the Speech highlighting the priorities of new ministers and setting the scene for parliamentary battle ahead.Has there always been a Queen's Speech?Traditions surrounding the State Opening of Parliament and the delivery of a speech by the monarch can be traced back as far as the 16th Century. The current ceremony dates from 1852, when the Palace of Westminster was re-opened after the fire of 1834. There is normally one Queen's Speech every year, although the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition government decided against having one in 2011, arguing that its legislative programme was so extensive that it would require two years to implement. The last government also decided to switch the State Opening from its traditional November date to the Spring.Does The Queen write the Speech?No. It is written by ministers but is delivered by the Sovereign from the throne of the House of Lords on behalf of Her Majesty's government. The Speech varies in length from year to year, depending on the number of actual bills and other items - such as draft legislation and foreign policy objectives - included but normally takes about 10 minutes. The Queen, to whom the document is sent beforehand for signing, also uses the occasion to give details of upcoming visits to the UK by other heads of state and any state visits she is making overseas.Does The Queen come every year?Pretty much but not quite. This will be the 64th time during her reign that she has delivered the Speech. She has been absent on two occasions, in 1959 and 1963, when she was pregnant. On those occasions, the Speech was read by the Lord Chancellor. Is there a lot of pomp and ceremony involved?Yes. The State Opening begins with the Queen's procession from Buckingham Palace to Westminster, escorted by the Household Cavalry - an event which always draws large crowds along the route.The Queen arrives at Sovereign's Entrance and proceeds to the Robing Room. Wearing the Imperial State Crown and the Robe of State, she leads the Royal Procession through the Royal Gallery, packed with guests, to the chamber of the House of Lords.The House of Lords official known as 'Black Rod' is sent to summon the Commons. The doors to the Commons chamber are shut in his face: a practice dating back to the Civil War, symbolising the Commons' independence from the monarchy. Black Rod strikes the door three times before it is opened. MPs then follow Black Rod and the Commons Speaker to the Lords chamber, standing at the opposite end to the Throne, known as the Bar of the House, to listen to the speech.The speech itself is carried into the Chamber by the Lord Chancellor in a satchel. He hands the speech to the Sovereign and takes possession of it again once it has been delivered.Until a few years ago, the Speech was written on a rare form of calf's skin known as vellum. It is now written on high-quality parchment paper. What happens after the Speech?The Queen returns to Buckingham Palace while MPs and peers break for lunch. A couple of hours later MPs reassemble in the Commons to begin debating the Speech. After introductory speeches by two MPs - traditionally one a relative newcomer and the other a long-serving member - the prime minister gets to his feet to ""sell"" the Speech to the Commons, explaining what is in it and what it says about his vision for the country and the changes he wants to make.The leader of the opposition then gets their chance to respond before backbenchers chip in. The debate on what is known as the ""Humble Address"" normally lasts about five days, with a largely symbolic vote taking place at the end.Peers also debate the Queen's Speech but do not vote on it.It is in the Queen's Speech. That means it will happen?Not necessarily. The Queen's Speech is the equivalent of the government's ""mission statement"" for the year ahead but that does not mean everything in it will become law. There are plenty of examples of proposed legislation which fall by the wayside due to political opposition. A recent high-profile example was a bill proposing elections to the House of Lords in 2012, which was withdrawn four months after being announced by the coalition government.In contrast, there are bills which are not mentioned in the Queen's Speech which are subsequently introduced in response to changing circumstances. One example from the last session was a bill allowing female bishops to sit in the House of Lords. There were 11 full bills included in the 2014 Queen's Speech but Parliament ended up approving 26 bills during the 2014-5 session. Traditionally, the first Queen's Speech of a new Parliament tends to contain more bills than later ones as ministers seek to capitalise on the momentum of their party's election victory, at a time when the opposition is often at its most divided."
2015-05-25,Lessons from Wilson,https://web.archive.org//web/20150526221307/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32844483,"Three days after the first general election in 1974, which led to Harold Wilson unexpectedly taking office as prime minister of a minority Labour government, his friend and colleague Barbara Castle sat down in her bolthole, Hell Corner Farm, in the Buckinghamshire countryside to update her diary. ""So here we go for a bumpy ride,"" she wrote. It was, if anything, something of an underestimate of the five years that lay ahead.It was already obvious that day, that a second election would have to be held. After a difficult few months, Wilson went to the country in October and was rewarded with an overall majority of just three seats in the House of Commons. Yet during that spring and summer, despite numerous parliamentary defeats, the government took steps to control inflation, keep mortgage rates down, and reduce VAT.It also introduced legislation on sharing the revenues of North Sea oil more fairly than before, and established a social contract with the trade unions to try to limit strike action through agreed controls on pay rises. Once he had a majority government, the limits that were imposed on Wilson's subsequent ability to manage a competent administration, were more often to come from political problems within his own party than from his slender overall command of the Commons.So it may also prove for David Cameron, recently re-installed as prime minister, but now for the first time as a man with a mandate. He has an overall majority in the House of 12 seats, considerably less than the 76 he could count on in coalition with the Liberal Democrats.But as Wilson and his successor, James Callaghan, found in the 1970s there will be many occasions when some of the smaller parties may willingly pitch in to support the government.February:Labour: Seats won: 301, up 20. Share of vote: 37.2%Conservative: Seats won: 297, down 37. Share of vote: 37.9%Liberal: Seats won: 14, up eight. Share of vote: 19.3%Turnout: 78.8%October:Labour: Seats won: 319, up 18. Share of vote: 39.2%Conservative: Seats won: 277, down 20. Share of vote: 35.8%Liberal: Seats won: 13, down 1. Share of vote: 18.3%Turnout: 72.8%Uncanny political parallels with 1974It was, as Castle predicted, a bumpy ride, but it was also an immensely exciting one. I had already worked at Westminster for three years at the time but I became a lobby correspondent in 1974 and therefore had access to the inside track of the political circuit. It was in the bars and lobbies and restaurants that the planning and plotting and political manoeuvring took place.But the chamber of the Commons itself was also one of the most rewarding places to observe the spectacle of government. Time and time again I can recall sliding into my seat in the Press Gallery, wondering how on earth Wilson was going to get out of whatever the latest crisis was to engulf him. Summoning up the spirit of those fevered times is not difficult in the context of the following: It was perhaps scarcely surprising, as Bernard Donoughue, head of the Number 10 Policy Unit, noted repeatedly in his Downing Street Diaries, that Wilson was cracking open the brandy bottle at noon and knocking it back until late at night. Wilson was a superb operator with a mastery of the House of Commons but the strains took their toll.He became increasingly paranoid about leaks and the press and the security services, about his warring party and supposed colleagues and the fact - yes, Barbara! - that so many of them were keeping diaries with a view to publication. He hated Question Time and needed those brandies just to get through the then 30-minute session once a week. His decision to resign in 1976 astonished the political world at the time but maybe in retrospect it should not have been such a surprise. The Labour government had by then achieved a great deal without the necessity to compromise, except occasionally with its own supporters, but it was hard fought. Four nights a week there would be crucial votes, sometimes a series of votes lasting a couple of hours, from 10pm. It was an administration run by a necessarily powerful Whips' Office and what was to follow under Callaghan would prove even more tense. In early 1977 the Callaghan government lost its overall majority, which had been whittled away in by-elections, and the new leader of the Opposition, Margaret Thatcher, put down a vote of no confidence. It led to negotiations with the Liberal leader, David Steel, at the head of a group of 13 MPs, for the formation of the Lib-Lab Pact. It was an agreement under which the Liberals supported the government in return for policy consultation, and lasted until the autumn of 1978. The Liberals got little from it, apart from a tweak at the black petticoat of power, but by then it was anticipated that Callaghan would shortly call an election.His failure to do so and the subsequent industrial ""winter of discontent"" would lead to Labour being out of government for 18 years.David Cameron is on an electoral honeymoon at the moment but the forthcoming Queen's Speech will give the new Commons a taste of what lies ahead. It will also serve notice to the Conservative government's opponents in the House of Lords, where it is heavily outnumbered by the current composition of the upper House.And then there is, as ever, the question of Europe. The prime minister and his chief whip, Mark Harper, might both find a study of the 1970s quite helpful over the next few days."
2015-05-25,Man overboard,https://web.archive.org//web/20150526221307/http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-32830379,"Harold Wilson died 20 years ago, on 24 May 1995. He would have died many years before that, writes novelist Isabel Wolff, had her family not saved him from drowning. As a child I spent many family holidays on the Isles of Scilly, 28 miles off the Cornish coast. We'd spend our time walking, cycling and, best of all, rock-pooling.  But where we would normally expect to catch a few shrimps and the odd crab, there was one memorable year when we pulled the Leader of Her Majesty's Opposition out of the water.  It was 10 August 1973 and we were enjoying a bike ride around the largest island, St Mary's. I was with my parents, my elder brother Simon, 16, then a pupil at Rugby School, his best friend Robert, and my younger brother, Matthew, who was 10.  As we cycled along a path above an isolated bay, Matthew spotted an empty rubber dinghy racing out to the open sea. As we watched it speed towards the horizon we wondered whose it was and why it was loose.  Suddenly my father said that he thought he'd heard a cry. Sure enough, above the buffeting of the wind we could just make out a distressed male voice. My father cupped his hands and shouted: ""What is your trouble?""  ""I can't get into my boat,"" the voice answered. ""Fetch a dinghy!""  We pedalled down to the bay as fast as we could.  My father yelled: ""We'll get to you in a few minutes. Can you hold on?""  ""Yes - for a bit,"" came the faint reply. While Robert sped off to alert the Coastguard, Simon found a dinghy - but it had no oars. My father hurriedly looked around for a pair but then, further off, saw a wooden ""pram"" dinghy, its oars still in its rowlocks.  He and Simon carried this to the water's edge and, with Simon guiding him, my father rowed out towards a group of motor launches moored about 300 yards from the shore. While they did this my mother, Matthew and I waited on the beach, which was deserted except for a benign looking Labrador chained up by a fisherman's hut.  The dog's name tag said ""Paddy"" and Matthew and I stroked his ears while we anxiously waited for events to unfold.   Twenty minutes later we saw my father and Simon coming back. Hunched between them in the boat was a bedraggled looking, but familiar figure.  ""It's Harold Wilson,"" I said.  As my father rowed towards the quay, the Labour leader suddenly stood up, nearly swamping the boat. He then sat down again until it had docked, and Simon helped him onto dry land.  I vividly recall how shocked he looked. His shorts and shirt were drenched, his hair was plastered to his scalp, his teeth were chattering and his face was white.  He declined my father's offer of further help, including the loan of a bike to get back to his bungalow, but said that he was glad that we'd come along when we did.  My father jovially responded that it wasn't every day one pulled a former prime minister out of the water and that we were happy to have been able to help.  Satisfied that Wilson was all right, we left him with Paddy and cycled away.  As we ate our picnic lunch my father and Simon explained that Wilson had slipped into the sea while attempting to step from his rubber dinghy onto his motor launch.  The dinghy had shot away from him - the dinghy that we'd seen.  Unable to pull himself into the boat, Wilson had been left hanging on to the fender ropes for dear life. He'd told them that he'd been feeling sea-sick and that his arms felt ""numb"" and were ""giving out"".  Simon had stepped on to Wilson's boat and had then hauled the man on to the deck ""like a sack of potatoes"".  Dad then swore us all to secrecy - if the story got out it could ruin the opposition leader's holiday, and our own.  The next morning we went down to Porthcressa and by chance we saw Wilson coming off the beach.   I remember thinking that he'd be happy to see us again - perhaps he'd even ask us to tea? To my surprise I saw a flash of irritation cross his face.   My father greeted him and asked how he was.  He replied that he felt all right, if rather stiff, and that he had spent the rest of the day in bed.  ""I've had my swim for the holiday though,"" he added pleasantly, then he went on his way and we didn't see him again.  Returning home after the holiday we told no-one what had happened but somehow, a month later, the story got out.  First my father was approached by our local paper which made the story a splash: ""Rugby Family Rescues Mr. Wilson From Sea."" This got picked up by the Birmingham Post and within 48 hours my father's face was on the front of every national newspaper.  Headlines such as ""Wilson Snatched From Drowning"" and ""Wilson Rescued in Sea Drama"" amused us, but we were outraged by the Daily Mirror's ""My Dog Tipped me In!""  In a piece of Labour spin, Wilson's press secretary, Joe Haines, had apparently blamed the labrador.  There was even a photo of ""the culprit"", Paddy, who was ""in the doghouse"".  One could see the need for damage limitation - the incident was extremely embarrassing for Wilson, not least because the Prime Minister Ted Heath was a world-class yachtsman. There were cartoons of Heath grinning at the news on board his yacht, Morning Cloud.  My father, a nuclear engineer, was besieged at work by TV film crews and quizzed about his voting habits. ""Lifelong Tory Saves Wilson from Drowning"", announced the Daily Telegraph.  The Times pointed out that the Labour Leader, whose party had pledged to end private education, had been rescued by a public schoolboy.  And so it went on. We put up with myriad jokes of the ""Why didn't you throw him back?"" variety.  In the meantime Haines continued to elaborate on the story.  Wilson, he claimed in the Mirror, was in ""no danger"".  He ""could have swum to the beach"" but was ""waiting for a friend"".  The truth is, Harold Wilson would have died.  Aged 57, he'd been in the cold water, never more than 15C on Scilly, for more than half an hour.  Knowing the strong Atlantic currents, he hadn't dared risk the long swim back to the beach.  Worst of all, in that deserted spot, there had been no-one to hear his cries.   Reflecting on the incident afterwards, my father told us that Wilson seemed not to understand that it was ""only by the slenderest margins"" that his life had been saved.  Six months later, in February 1974, Harold Wilson became prime minister again.It's now 42 years since ""The Wilson Affair"" as my family always called it.  It seems strange that despite all the publicity this very significant event in the life of Wilson is almost unknown.  Neither of his official biographers, Ben Pimlott and Philip Ziegler, mentioned it in their respective books, nor did Joe Haines revisit it in his own memoir of Wilson, Glimmers of Twilight.  I sometimes wondered how Wilson's colleagues had viewed the story at the time. Were they sympathetic? Amused?  Did they pull his leg about it?  ""Oh I remember it well,"" Denis Healey told me when I phoned him in the House of Lords a few months ago. ""Harold seemed very embarrassed by it and was clearly anxious to play the whole thing down.  We didn't feel that we could mention it to him - definitely not.""  And if my family hadn't happened to pass by when we did?  It's fair to say that the course of British politics might have been rather different.  Denis Healey or Jim Callaghan might have succeeded Wilson. Edward Heath might not have been defeated in 1974 and there might well have been no Tory leadership challenge the following year and therefore, quite possibly, no Thatcher premiership.  My late brother, Simon, used to wonder whether our father may, on that fateful August day, have inadvertently launched Margaret  Thatcher's prime ministerial career. The rest, as they say, is history.Isabel Wolff is author of GhostwrittenSubscribe to the BBC News Magazine's email newsletter to get articles sent to your inbox"
2015-05-25,Mark Mardell,https://web.archive.org//web/20150526221307/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32803419,"The UK's future direction for at least a generation hangs precariously on an uncertainty, balanced on the tip of the unknown.I am talking of course about the planned referendum on the EU.  The brilliant thing about referendums, and one of the features that makes them so irksome for politicians is their binary clarity - ""Yes"" or ""No"", ""In"" or ""Out"".This one will be like that, but it isn't at the moment. For now, the most important group of potential voters are the ""Maybes"".They are not unsure because they are hesitant Harrys and Harriets who haven't grasped the big issues.It is much more political than that.  Some big names are rallying around the banner of ""Maybe"".The Foreign Secretary Phillip Hammond is one of them, and perhaps the most important is the mop-headed mayhap Boris Johnson. Their eventual decision depends, they say, on what change in the relationship David Cameron manages to negotiate - and that may well depend on what they and others argue, in political cabinet, he should demand. This is unknown because it is as yet undecided. Indeed, I am fairly sure almost all Conservative MPs will be herded into the ""Maybe"" camp by a twitch of deferent loyalty on one flank, the cracking whip of strategic cunning on the other.Those who know with certainty in their own hearts they will vote ""No"" may feel they have to give the prime minister a chance, or appear grossly disloyal. This has the added advantage that having played the part of a loyalist waiting with open-jawed admiration for the prime minister to return home with a piece of paper, their eventual disappointment will pack more heft. At the end of the process, they can declare that, despite all their high expectations, the deal is not good enough, and the obdurate EU has left them with no choice but to campaign for an ""Out"".  Equally, those who are determined to stay in might as well drape themselves in temporary Euroscepticism and mutter about how hard it is for Mr Cameron to ""squeeze anything out of that lot"".  When Mr Cameron returns with a deal, however paltry,  they can proclaim it a master stroke that forces them into the ""Yes"" camp. Still, some will have a genuine bottom line.It is not clear if the prime minister himself is one of them.He has set out, in rather loose terms, his aims, in the Sunday Telegraph last March.The trouble with most of them is that success would be difficult to measure. We will legislate in the first session of the next Parliament for an in-out referendum to be held on Britain's membership of the EU before the end of 2017. We will negotiate a new settlement for Britain in the EU. And then we will ask the British people whether they want to stay in on this basis, or leave. We will protect our economy from any further integration of the Eurozone. The integration of the Eurozone has raised acute questions for non-Eurozone countries like the UK. We benefit from the single market and do not want to stand in the way of the Eurozone resolving its difficulties.But we will not let the integration of the Eurozone jeopardise the integrity of the single market or in any way disadvantage the UK.We want to see powers flowing away from Brussels, not to it. We want national parliaments to be able to work together to block unwanted European legislation. And we want an end to our commitment to an ""ever closer union"", as enshrined in the treaty to which every EU country has to sign up.What sort of change would ensure ""businesses liberated from red tape"" or ""powers flowing away from Brussels""? Words alone would not suffice for those who think such changes are vital if the UK is to stay in the EU - after all, the European Commission would say it backs both. ""Free movement to take up work, not free benefits"" is more concrete and eminently achievable but may not look like the ""fundamental"" change in relationship that is promised. But ""new mechanisms in place to prevent vast migrations across the Continent"" looks much easier to declare as a ""win"" or ""lose"".After persistent warnings, particularly from German Chancellor Angela Merkel, that ""free movement of people"" was not up for grabs, the prime minister appeared to drop the idea. But he told the House of Commons only two months ago: ""In the coming two years, we have the opportunity to reform the EU and fundamentally change Britain's relationship with it. ""We have the opportunity to build a European Union that is more competitive, more flexible and more accountable to the people, where powers flow back to member states, not just away from them, and where freedom of movement is no longer an unqualified right.""How much would the EU have to qualify that right, to persuade the doubters?Would a promise to stop putative Serbians coming to Britain after their country joins, in perhaps 2030, do the trick? Again, that is unknown and uncertain.At the moment, most backbenchers are keeping their heads down and powder dry. But Jacob Rees Mogg, MP for North East Somerset and member of the European Scrutiny Committee in the last Parliament, told me: ""I think the touchstone for renegotiation will be the free movement of people. ""It is one of the four freedoms of the European Union, and if the EU is  willing to give ground on that it will show that it is willing to consider a fundamental reform rather than just tinkering at the edges. ""So it is symbolically important as well as representing a deep concern of the British people.""This is admirable in its clarity, and I suspect it will be a  touchstone too for many of his colleagues. Others may set the bar higher or lower, but one new MP told me: ""I wouldn't like to be in the prime minister's shoes.""He knows it has to be real - he can't just come back with a bit of polish on it."" The prime minister's challenge is to come back with a deal so bright and sunny that the snows of uncertainty melt away to reveal the sunny uplands of victory. Is that likely? Maybe."

There's likely to be more discussion about it, but I'm led to believe that what we are heading towards is a question along the lines of whether the UK should remain in the EU.""That is significant because it would allow those who want the status quo to continue once there has been a renegotiation, who want the UK to remain a member of the EU, to style themselves as the Yes campaign. Yes to stay in, Yes to remain.""So it could be that there is some discussion of that over the coming days.""In the Queen's Speech, Mr Cameron said he would renegotiate the UK's membership and pursue reform of the European Union ""for the benefit of all member states"", pledging ""early legislation"" to pave the way for a referendum by the end of 2017.Downing Street said this would give the public a ""voice and a real choice on Europe"". It has also confirmed that members of the House of Lords and citizens of Commonwealth countries living in Gibraltar will be entitled to vote in the referendum - as well as UK nationals who have been living abroad for less than 15 years."
2015-05-26,Sturgeon attacks UK spending cuts,https://web.archive.org//web/20150526223055/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32878559,"First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has used a speech in Edinburgh to attack the ""scale and speed"" of spending cuts planned by the UK government.Speaking ahead of the Queen's Speech, the SNP leader also reiterated her party's support for Britain's continued membership of the European Union. She made the speech on a visit to Heart of Midlothian FC's Tynecastle Stadium.She was joined by the Scottish Finance Secretary John Swinney.The pair also unveiled the Scottish Business Pledge which aims to promote ""fairness, equality and sustainable economic growth"".An ""alternative to austerity"" was the centrepiece of the Scottish National Party's successful general election campaign.In her first major economic speech since the election, Ms Sturgeon argued that the prime minister cannot ignore the democratic will of the Scottish people. She said: ""The result of the general election provides an opportunity and a challenge for the Scottish government. There is clearly an opportunity to ensure that Scotland's priorities are better understood. ""But there is also a significant challenge in working with a majority government at Westminster - many of whose policies we disagree with.""We will continue to oppose spending reductions of the scale and speed that the UK government has suggested. These would slow economic recovery and make deficit reduction more difficult - something shown by the impact of the cuts imposed after 2010.""Ms Sturgeon said David Cameron must either change his approach or find ways to lessen the impact on Scotland. She also said that business, employees and government needed to work more closely together to build a prosperous and cohesive society. The SNP leader again insisted that the UK should only withdraw from the EU if there was a majority in favour of exit in all four nations of the UK.She said: ""Since a referendum is now inevitable we will work to protect Scotland's interests in that referendum. We'll propose a double majority meaning that exit from the European Union would only be possible if all four nations agreed to that, something that would ensure that Scotland couldn't be forced out of the European Union against our will.""And during the run up to the referendum, the Scottish government will of course make a strong and positive case for staying in the EU.""The first minister also called on businesses to commit to paying the living wage and promoting fair practices as she launched a new industry code.Companies wanting to sign up to the Scottish Business Pledge must agree to pay the living wage to all direct employees over 18.They must also be delivering on at least two of the pledge's nine components, as well as committing to achieving the rest ""over time"". Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme, Scottish Finance Secretary Mr Swinney, said: ""This has been described by the first minister as a shared national endeavour and I think that's exactly how we should look at this - government and business coming together.""My priority is to get people into employment and then to make sure that as much of that employment as possible is high quality, productive employment, making a high-value contribution to our society.""Hearts, who recently won promotion back to the Scottish Premiership, are one of the first companies to sign up to the pledge. The club's chief executive Ann Budge said: ""By introducing the living wage across our business, by investing in youth education and staff education, by engaging fully with the community and by working closely with the Foundation of Hearts to introduce fan ownership, we are the perfect match for this initiative.""Businessman Brendan Burns, who operates a forestry company and is a former UK policy chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, told Radio Scotland's Kaye Adams programme that the Scottish government needed to address more than just the implementation of the living wage.He said: ""I pay more than the living wage, but that is not the point. To be able to pay the living wage, you have to get more efficiency into Scottish businesses.""At this moment, that is what we don't have. Every businessman I meet will always say 'I would like to pay the living wage', but you can't pay out of a business if the profit isn't there. The profit is there when the business is more efficient.""Scottish Conservative enterprise spokesman Murdo Fraser MSP said many firms could not afford to pay the living wage and more incentives should be offered to businesses.""In principle, the Scottish Business Pledge sounds like a decent strategy,"" he said.""However, scratch beneath the surface and it would be realistic to say that many small to medium-sized business cannot afford to pay staff the living wage. This is particularly the case in sectors like care where income levels are set by the state.""The Scottish government should be helping these businesses where they can. That's why we're calling for a living wage business bonus for small businesses which pay the living wage, in the form of a reduction in their business rates.""The Scottish Greens welcomed the new pledge but urged the first minister to go further and address environmental standards and tax avoidance. MSP Patrick Harvie MSP said: ""Given the clear opportunity Scotland has to develop a low-carbon economy that respects our finite resources, and the urgent need to meet our failed climate targets, it's disappointing that the environmental impact of business is barely mentioned in this pledge scheme."" ""Ministers are also missing the chance to make a strong statement that tax dodgers won't be tolerated. """
2015-05-26,Ex-MP Bruce: Politicians tell lies,https://web.archive.org//web/20150526223055/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32881672,"Politicians tell ""brazen lies"", senior Lib Dem Sir Malcolm Bruce has claimed as he defended the actions of ex-Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael. Mr Carmichael is facing calls to resign after admitting he backed the leaking of a memo during the election campaign incorrectly suggesting Nicola Sturgeon wanted David Cameron as prime minister.The MP for Orkney and Shetland said previously he had not been aware of it.Sir Malcolm said the MP had been wrong but lying was common in public life. The SNP have called on Mr Carmichael - the only remaining Lib Dem MP in Scotland - to consider his position after an official Cabinet Office inquiry found he approved the leak of an official memo by his special adviser to a newspaper during the campaign.The document, written by a civil servant in the Scotland Office, claimed the Scottish First Minister told the French Ambassador to the UK that she would prefer Mr Cameron as prime minister rather than Ed Miliband - comments Ms Sturgeon has always insisted she never made. At the time, Mr Carmichael said the first he had heard of the memo was when he was contacted by a journalist. He has since acknowledged that while he had not seen the document before it was published, he was aware of its content and agreed that it should be made public.The parliamentary standards commissioner has said she has received a number of complaints about Mr Carmichael's conduct and is considering whether they fall within her remit.The BBC's Tim Reid said Mr Carmichael was not an MP at the time of the episode - because parliament had broken up for the general election - but he was campaigning to retain his seat and remained a cabinet minister. A member of the public has also complained to the police about Mr Carmichael's conduct, our correspondent added. Sir Malcolm said Mr Carmichael had faced up to the consequences of his actions, having apologised and foregone the severance pay he was entitled to after losing his Cabinet position.But he told the BBC that it was ""perfectly reasonable"" for him to remain as a ""first-class"" MP for Orkney and Shetland. ""Alistair has recognised that he has made a mistake,"" he told Radio 4's Today programme. ""People are entitled to make mistakes, learn from them and move on.""Sir Malcolm, who was MP for 30 years until retiring at the election, said Scotland was a ""divided and bruised"" country after the election and that Mr Carmichael, as one of only three non-SNP MPs elected to Westminster, had a key role to play in representing his constituents and holding both the UK and Scottish governments to account.The SNP, he said, were ""judging people by standards that they do not apply to themselves"" and if Mr Carmichael quit ""what we will have seen is the SNP bully a very good MP out of office for a mistake he has acknowledged and apologised for"".""The SNP clearly want to extinguish all opposition in Scotland. That is their objective and they will stop at nothing to do it.""Asked whether it would be acceptable for an MP who had not told the truth to remain in office, he replied: ""I'm acknowledging that if (Mr Carmichael) has said 'I didn't know about something I did know in the heated atmosphere of an election campaign' that was part of the mistake, which he has apologised for.""""My point is if you are suggesting that every MP who has never quite told the truth or indeed told a brazen lie - including ministers, including Cabinet ministers, including prime ministers - we would clear out the House of Commons very fast, I would suggest.Asked if lying was widespread in public life, he said: ""No, well, yes. I think the answer is that lots of people have told lies and you know that to be perfectly true....He added: ""We should, of course, hold people to account and if people lie they should take some consequences but Alistair has taken consequences.""The SNP said the comments amounted to an ""increasingly desperate attempt to defend the indefensible"".""Being an MP or MSP is a huge privilege for anyone elected to serve - and untruthfulness can never be simply brushed aside in the way that Sir Malcolm suggests it should,"" said MP Pete Wishart.""The Lib Dems' defence of Mr Carmichael gets more ludicrous by the day, and all Sir Malcolm has succeeded in doing is to keep the focus on his colleague.""The Cabinet Office said the cost of its investigation had been ""minimal"" and said there were no plans for a further investigation into whether Mr Carmichael had breached the ministerial code.Labour MP John Mann said the row illustrated the need for a stronger system of voter recall for politicians accused of misconduct. ""There are plenty of people who avoid answering a question but that is not the same as lying,"" he said. Under a law championed by the Lib Dems in the last Parliament, an MP's seat becomes vacant if they are suspended from the Commons for at least 10 days and a 10% of their constituents subsequently sign a petition calling for a by-election. There has also been criticism from one prominent Lib Dem activist. ""It is a rubbish defence/excuse and not one a party reduced from 57 MPs to just 8 should be making,"" tweeted Stephen Tall, former co-editor of the Lib Dem Voice website. The Scottish Liberal Democrats have said that Mr Carmichael, who held off a strong challenge from the SNP to regain his seat by 817 votes, will not face any disciplinary action."
2015-05-26,PM and EC president hold reform talks,https://web.archive.org//web/20150526223055/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32877712,"David Cameron has told European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker that ""British people are not happy with the status quo"" in Europe. The prime minister hosted Mr Juncker at Chequers ahead of a week of efforts to renegotiate Britain's EU membership.The EC president ""reiterated that he wanted to find a fair deal for the UK"", said a No 10 spokesman after the talks.Meanwhile, Poland's prime minister told Mr Cameron she would not tolerate moves to ""discriminate"" against her country.Ewa Kopacz said it would be ""regrettable"" if the UK voted to leave the EU, and Polish people working in the UK contributed to economic growth and should be ""treated in the same way as others"".She is due to meet Mr Cameron on Friday.Mr Cameron and Mr Juncker's meeting came as reports suggest France and Germany are planning to announce further eurozone integration.French newspaper Le Monde is reporting that the two countries have agreed a deal to bring about closer political union between eurozone countries without the need for changes to the treaties which govern the EU. Mr Cameron has argued that treaty changes are needed to bring about the reforms he wants - creating a two-tier Europe, with closer integration between eurozone countries and Britain exempted from the drive for ""ever closer union"" between member states.The prime minister's call for tougher benefit restrictions on new migrants - expected to be a key demand in renegotiation talks - would also need to be agreed by all member states.The chances of getting a new treaty ratified in 28 countries by the end of 2017, in time for Britain to hold its planned in/out referendum, are remote, according to the BBC's Europe correspondent Chris Morris.But, he adds, member states have been allowed to change their relationship with the EU in the past and for those changes to be included in future treaties, something that could be presented as a treaty change by Mr Cameron ahead of Britain's referendum.The talks between Mr Cameron and Mr Juncker on Monday focused on ""reforming the EU and renegotiating the UK's relationship with it"", the No 10 spokesman said.  ""The prime minister underlined that the British people are not happy with the status quo and believe that the EU needs to change in order to better address their concerns.""Mr Juncker reiterated that he wanted to find a fair deal for the UK and would seek to help. ""They talked through the issue at some length in the spirit of finding solutions to these problems. They agreed that more discussion would be needed, including with other leaders, on the best way forward.""The two men also discussed the Greek economic situation, as well as Ukraine and sanctions against Russia, Downing Street added. Mr Juncker is opposed to treaty changes but Eurosceptic MPs argue it is not possible to have meaningful negotiations without them.Conservative backbencher, Bernard Jenkin, said the Le Monde leak ""went to the heart"" of what the prime minister's promised renegotiation was about. ""The treaties aren't designed to allow different states to do different things. It is all assumed that we will all be involved with integration,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.UKIP MP Douglas Carswell said before the meeting that the prime minister's promised renegotiation would be ""more or less worthless"" as it would not ""fundamentally change our relationship with Europe"". Over the coming days, Mr Cameron will travel to France, Germany, Denmark, Poland and the Netherlands to hold talks with European leaders.  Earlier, No 10 confirmed UK-based citizens from most EU countries would not get a vote in the referendum. The eligibility rules will be broadly the same as for a general election, rather than for local or European polls.  Legislation on the voting eligibility for the referendum will be introduced to Parliament via the EU Referendum Bill. It will say:A No 10 source said about the franchise: ""This is a big decision for our country, one that is about the future of the United Kingdom. That's why we think it's important that it is British, Irish and Commonwealth citizens that are the ones who get to decide.""Eurosceptics have previously claimed that as many as 1.5 million people from other EU countries could have been allowed to vote in the referendum, if it had taken place under the rules for local government elections.David Cameron is ready to start renegotiating the terms of Britain's EU membership ahead of a referendum. Here is some further reading on what it all means: The UK and the EU: Better off in or out?What Britain wants from EuropeQ&A: The UK's planned EU referendumTimeline: EU referendum debateWhy Germany is David Cameron's new best friend"
2015-05-26,UK 'will not accept migrant quotas',https://web.archive.org//web/20150526223055/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32885662,"The UK will not be part of any EU plan to relocate thousands of African migrants who have arrived in Italy and Greece, the international development secretary has told the BBC. Justine Greening said the government will not accept mandatory quotas.The European Commission is expected to announce details of its plan to deal with the migrants on Wednesday.Reports suggest it will call for a quota system for member states to relocate some 40,000 asylum seekers.The UK has an opt-out which it has previously said it would use.Many of the migrants arrived in southern Europe by boat in recent months. The plan to use quotas to resettle those who have made it to Europe has caused controversy among several EU countries, including France and Spain.Ms Greening told the BBC: ""We don't accept having mandatory quotas or mandatory resettlement programmes. ""Our concern is that approach simply ends up acting as a pull for more migrants to make, what for many of them is a life and death decision to get on a boat that may not be sea worthy and over the past year 5,000 migrants have died at sea.""She said looking at why people were making the journeys was key.""If you look at what is driving people to start these journeys in the first place, it's the hope of a better life,"" she said.""And that's why the only real answer in the long term is to work together, as the international community, to tackle what is an international problem and to work together to deliver development and to level up the world so that we don't leave anyone behind, or leave anyone living in poverty in the future, as is happened in the past.""The issue was catapulted to the top of the EU agenda after hundreds of people were believed to have drowned when a boat carrying up to 700 migrants capsized in the Mediterranean Sea in April.The UN estimates that 60,000 people have already tried to cross the Mediterranean from North Africa this year.More than 1,800 migrants have died - a 20-fold increase on the same period in 2014.The UK has deployed a warship - HMS Bulwark - and search and rescue helicopters to the waters between Libya and Italy."

Mr Umunna hopes to assume a prominent role for Labour within the EU referendum campaign.But he acknowledged concerns for the party, suggesting campaigning alongside Conservatives and too vociferously in favour of EU membership could make the party vulnerable to UKIP.There are 44 seats where UKIP is now in second place to Labour.""There is a degree of hesitancy on the Labour side when it comes to making the case for us to stay in,"" Mr Umunna said.""I think everyone is agreed that is where we are and that is our position as a party, but the extent to which we should put ourselves at the forefront of the campaign to stay in there is a degree of hesitancy.""There is a worry that what beset us after the Scottish referendum - where we were on the winning side of the argument in terms of the way the referendum went but we saw the fall out after - there is a worry that that same fate will beset the Labour party in parts of England.""He said it was a ""worry"" that this could hand seats to UKIP.Explaining why he ruled himself out of the contest, Mr Umunna said: ""The level of media attention and pressure… when it began to affect my girlfriend, her family and my family and we had reporters for example going to her family when they were in the middle of having their Sunday roast with her 97-year-old grandmother - I found that very hard to stomach.""He added: ""For once I thought in my life I'm going to put my family, my girlfriend, her family, put them first - and this is not the right time for me.""My heart wasn't really in it at that moment, particularly going through that experience.""There were no skeletons, no revelations, I have absolutely nothing to hide.""Asked whether he could ever withstand the scrutiny, he said: ""If I ever chose to do something like this in the future then I'd have a much better understanding of it, but what I would say is I hope that issue of standing for the leadership never presents itself in my political journey again, because there should not be a vacancy because we will have a Labour PM in place in 2020.""Never say never, but right now this is not the priority in my life… I wouldn't say it was impossible but I think it's quite unlikely""He also said Ms Kendall had been ""making all the arguments that I would have been making if I was still in the contest""."
2015-05-26,NI welfare reform bill fails to pass,https://web.archive.org//web/20150526223055/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-32894371,"Northern Ireland's controversial Welfare Reform Bill has failed to pass at Stormont. A majority of 58 assembly members voted in favour and 39 voted against. However, the bill failed to pass because the nationalist Sinn Féin and SDLP put forward an official petition of concern. This meant the bill, to make changes to benefits that have been introduced in the rest of the UK, did not get the necessary cross-community support. There were several mitigation schemes in the bill that would have lessened its impact. But Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness of Sinn Féin said: ""This is a time when the (Stormont) executive parties need to stand together to defend our public services, particularly in terms of health, education and welfare.""Green Party leader Steven Agnew also signed the petition.During the assembly debate, Finance Minister Arlene Foster warned that if the bill failed to pass, ""£604m of cuts would have to be made to vital, frontline public services, the services that the most vulnerable in our community need and rely upon"".The debate went ahead despite Northern Ireland First Minister Peter Robinson's admission to hospital with a suspected heart attack on Monday.DUP sources say the 66-year-old party leader is making good progress and has been given a full briefing on Tuesday's events at Stormont. The measure was designed as a way to safeguard minority rights in Stormont's power-sharing assembly. If a petition of concern is presented to the assembly speaker, any motion or amendment will need cross-community support. In such cases, a vote on proposed legislation will only pass if supported by a weighted majority (60%) of members voting, including at least 40% of each of the nationalist and unionist designations present and voting.Effectively this means that, provided enough MLAs from a particular community agree, that community can exercise a veto over the assembly's decisions.

Mr Clark, who has replaced Eric Pickles as the Communities and Local Government Secretary, said the last government's one-to-one pledge only applied to ""additional"" housing sold after the new discount was introduced and that the promised new homes would eventually be built.""The object of that policy was not to replace the whole of the stock. This new policy is to replace it,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.""The other thing to point out in terms of the last policy is housing associations and councils had three years to replace the stock that was sold and so there is a lag and some of those properties are now being built.""The policy we're announcing in the Queen's Speech is very clear - every property that is sold will be replaced, one-for-one, so the housing stock is being expanded and people can achieve this aspiration that most of us want, to own our home.""He added: ""Just because you've signed a social tenancy doesn't mean you should be signing away your aspiration to own a home.""Labour said it supported ""people's aspiration to buy their own home"" but the Conservatives' numbers ""don't add up"".Shadow housing minister Emma Reynolds said: ""Ministers have not set out how this policy will be paid for, and housing experts have said that the plan is unworkable, unfunded and will lead to fewer affordable homes.""Greg Clark said today that every home will be replaced but it was clear he didn't even know his own policy when he said there was no requirement to replace homes under the existing policy.""The government made the same commitment in the last Parliament - and failed miserably with only one home started to be built for every 10 homes sold. Nobody will believe their promises now.""Henry Gregg, of the National Housing Federation, which represents housing associations, warned the government it could not ""take assets away from charities and independent organisations that are trying to solve the housing crisis"".He told the BBC News Channel attempting to replace properties that had been sold off - even if the one-to-one target was met - would not address the housing shortage and would be like ""filling a bath with the plug taken out"".""There's 11 million private renters out there and there's also three million adult children living with their parents.  ""Giving the right to buy to housing associations is not going to help those people and actually if there's £4.5bn available which the government says there is, we shouldn't be spending that on giving large discounts of £100,00 to a privileged few, we should be actually be building more homes for all of the private rented sector and people who are living at home with their parents for example."""

But the scale of the defeat, the complexity of the lessons and the huge task of holding things together while we rebuild requires a unifier - someone who can work across the political breadth of the party and with the unions.""He added: ""Our new leader must be able to give their total attention to establishing themselves and re-establishing Labour with the country. ""Labour's internal affairs have to be left largely to others but their deputy must be much more than a party manager and motivator.""Mr Healey spent four years at the Treasury under Gordon Brown and was also a housing minister before becoming shadow health secretary for a year from October 2010.He said he had been encouraged by colleagues to add his name to an already-crowded field.To be on the ballot each candidate needs nomination from 35 MPs, but with only 232 Labour MPs in total, not all seven of those currently standing will reach that target.Mr Healey has already nominated Yvette Cooper for the party leadership.She is running alongside Andy Burnham, Mary Creagh and Liz Kendall."
2015-05-26,NI first minister still in hospital,https://web.archive.org//web/20150526223055/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-32873965,"Northern Ireland's first minister Peter Robinson remains in hospital after suffering a suspected heart attack.Mr Robinson, 66, was taken to the Ulster Hospital, Dundonald, on Monday morning after he became ill.The leader of the Democratic Unionist Party was then transferred to Belfast's Royal Victoria Hospital (RVH) where he underwent a procedure.On Tuesday morning, his party colleague Arlene Foster said she understood his condition had stabilised.The first minister's hospitalisation comes on the eve of a major debate at Stormont over welfare reform.A statement from the hospital said: ""Mr Robinson underwent a procedure this morning and is currently recovering in the RVH. ""He and his family have requested the need for privacy from this point onwards.""Mr Robinson has served as first minister and DUP leader since 2008, succeeding lan Paisley in both jobs.The DUP has asked that the Robinson family's privacy should be respected.Prime Minister David Cameron tweeted his best wishes to Mr Robinson, wishing him a speedy recovery.Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon also sent her best wishes.DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds said: ""My understanding is that he took ill during the night and was taken to hospital. ""He is undergoing tests. It is  very difficult to say at this stage what his current position is. ""Hopefully he will be back soon in his full job and will make a speedy recovery.""Nobody could have planned for this.However, talking to people within the DUP earlier today, the sense is that Mr Robinson's medical condition doesn't change what they said was a legally-driven deadline for the welfare reform bill.It's all tied up with their hopes of getting a budget through Stormont.It now looks like that welfare reform bill will be vetoed because both the nationalist parties have signed a petition of concern.But at this stage, the intention is that the Social Development Minister, Mervyn Storey, is to still go ahead with that debate.Meanwhile, one would assume another DUP minister might stand in for Mr Robinson as first minister.That said, he may be out of hospital relatively soon, but in terms of going back to his desk job one would think that he would need to take some time out.I don't think any kind of formal decision has been made, but we do know that there is a procedure within the Stormont rules that allows another minister to step in as acting first minister for a series of six weeks.The DUP previously used that during the investigation into the Robinson family and him stepping down to clear his name.Arlene Foster at that point stepped in so it's possible Mrs Foster could come in and do the same again.Other politicians including Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness, Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams, Ulster Unionist leader Mike Nesbitt,  SDLP leader Alasdair McDonnell, TUV leader Jim Allister and Mr Robinson's Stormont colleague Peter Weir have wished Mr Robinson a speedy recovery.Mr McGuinness tweeted that he was concerned to hear the news.""My thoughts and prayers are with him, Iris and family,"" he said.Mr Nesbitt said: ""I am sorry to hear that the first minister has been taken into hospital this morning and I wish Peter a full and speedy recovery. Our thoughts are with him and his family.""Presbyterian Moderator Michael Barry sent ""warm wishes"" to the first minister and his family in what he said was ""a worrying time"" for them.On Tuesday, the Northern Ireland Assembly is due to debate the final stage of the controversial Welfare Reform Bill.Speaking about the planned debate in light of the first minister's illness, Mr McGuinness said: ""We will have to wait and see what happens overnight.""Last week, Mr Robinson warned that the assembly could not survive the scenario which would unfold if the welfare reform bill was not approved.The Northern Ireland parties had agreed a deal on Westminster's welfare reform in the Stormont House Agreement last December.However, Sinn Féin withdrew its support for the bill in March.Sinn Féin and the SDLP have signed a petition of concern which means the bill appears certain to be blocked on Tuesday as it will not get the necessary cross-community support."

And who is vying for the deputy leader job?Shadow health minister Liz Kendall was the first Labour MP to say they wanted a crack at the party's top job, saying a ""fundamentally new approach"" was needed.First elected to Parliament in 2010 as MP for Leicester West and appointed to the shadow front bench the same year, Ms Kendall is seen as a Blairite contender.She is a former special adviser to Harriet Harman and then Health Secretary Patricia Hewitt who has argued for reform of public services.In an interview for The House magazine in January, she said there ""will remain a role"" for private and voluntary firms in the health service, ""where they can add extra capacity to the NHS or challenge to the system"".Could she be a fresh face to lead a change of direction for Labour, or seen as too inside the Westminster bubble?The Labour MP for Leigh since 2001, Andy Burnham has plenty of government experience and is the current bookies' favourite.Mr Burnham served as health secretary under Gordon Brown and previously as culture secretary and chief secretary to the Treasury.He stood for the leadership in 2010 but lost out to Ed Miliband, going on to hold the shadow health brief under Mr Miliband's leadership. He is said to have strong trade union support.Declaring his intention to stand, he said Labour must support the ""aspirations of everyone"".Another former chief secretary to the Treasury - as well as a work and pensions minister under Gordon Brown - Yvette Cooper has been shadow home secretary for the past four years.A strong Commons performer, she has given Home Secretary Theresa May a hard time over matters including passport delays, border controls and extremism.She did not stand to succeed Mr Brown in 2010, in favour of her husband, Ed Balls.Announcing her bid this time around, she said: ""Our promise of hope wasn't strong enough to drown out the Tory and UKIP voices of fear. That's what we need to change.""The shadow international development secretary has announced her intention to join the race for the Labour leadership, via an article in the Daily MailMs Creagh joined parliament in 2005 as the MP for Wakefield, gaining experience in government as an assistant whip in 2009-10.She's also held various shadow cabinet positions in opposition, most notably as shadow secretary of state for environment, food and rural affairs - and transport.Ms Creagh held onto her brief as international development secretary in acting Labour leader Harriet Harman's recent reshuffle of the shadow cabinet.Rushanara Ali announced her intention to run for Labour's deputy leadership claiming the party had become ""unelectable"".She was first elected in 2010 in Bethnal Green and Bow, defeating incumbent MP George Galloway. She served as shadow education minister until September last year, when she resigned from the party's front bench in order to abstain in the vote on air strikes against Islamic State extremists in Iraq.On the future direction for Labour, she said the party needed to be ""radical"" and ""take risks"", adding : ""I think it's time for my generation to roll up their sleeves and get to work.""She says supporters of her campaign include shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt and former minister Keith Vaz.The MP for Don Valley has been Labour's shadow energy and climate change secretary since 2011, after a stint heading up the Department for Communities and Local Government.Ms Flint held on to her current position in the latest shadow cabinet reshuffle.She also held various ministerial positions during Gordon Brown's premiership, but famously resigned from as Europe minister after accusing him of treating her and her female colleagues as ""window dressing"".A former GMTV presenter, Gloria de Piero joined Parliament as the MP for Ashfield in 2010.She immediately rose to shadow ministerial ranks, taking on a culture, media and sport brief and then home affairs.Since 2013 she's been a shadow minister for women and equalities, being one of Harriet Harman's team on Labour's woman-to-woman ""pink bus"" campaign.The MP for West Bromwich since 2001.

Another from the 2010 intake, she was praised for campaign against payday loans companies, and has a strong following on social media.She told the Sunday Mirror: ""Too many voters think Labour is no longer a movement for social justice but a machine that only kicks in to gear at election time.""Shadow environment secretary Angela Eagle plans to travel the country to speak to people who did the ""hard graft"" in the election campaign.The MP for Wallasey said Labour could not be ""complacent"" if it was to reverse its general election defeat.Ms Eagle, an MP since 1992, held a number of ministerial jobs during the last Labour government and in 2013 became chair of the Labour Party.She is arguably best-known for having a twin sister, Maria, who is also a Labour MP.A former journalist and Labour cabinet minister, Ben Bradshaw has been the MP for Exeter since 1997.He plans a ""big tent"" approach to ensure Labour does not miss out on votes in the south of England, saying the party has to ""broaden its appeal"".Reflecting on who should replace Ed Miliband, he said: ""I would prefer to see one of the new generation come forward rather than someone associated with the Blair and Brown era.""If we really want to win in 2020 - and I think we need to for the country's sake -  I would like to see someone from the new generation without that baggage from the past.""The MP for Tottenham was the first person to publicly weigh up a leadership bid, telling the BBC that he would consider standing if colleagues wanted him to.But he's ruled himself out of the top job, saying his principal aim is to become Labour's candidate for Mayor of London in 2016.""I think we need a leader that can win back the Midlands understand Scotland as well as the south.""Actually we need to do better in London, my strengths are in London and the south therefore I want to be the Labour candidate for Mayor,"" he told the BBC's Daily Politics programme.One of the most prominent black MPs in the party, the former former barrister is regarded as being on the right of the party, having served as a minister under both Tony Blair and Gordon Brown.His national profile rose during the 2011 riots in London, when he appealed for calm and reconciliation in the wake of the fatal shooting of Mark Duggan in his north London constituency. Dame Tessa Jowell was a key figure at the heart of New Labour - she once said she would ""jump under a bus"" for Tony Blair.The former Dulwich and West Norwood MP, who stood down at the general election after 20 years in Parliament, earned widespread plaudits for the role she played in London's bid for the 2012 Olympics and her subsequent performance as Olympics minister.She has vowed to bring ""Olympic-like discipline"" to changing London, promising to build more affordable homes.The former culture secretary, who was a psychiatric social worker before entering politics, is seen as one of the frontrunners in the race to be Labour's mayoral candidate, with one poll suggesting she is backed by 40% of Labour supporters.Sadiq Khan launched his bid to be London mayor with an attack on incumbent Boris Johnson, describing him as a ""red carpet mayor, somebody who is fantastic going to openings, great with a flute of champagne in his hands"".""I'd rather roll up my sleeves and fight for all Londoners,"" he added.The son of a bus driver, Mr Khan worked as a human rights solicitor before becoming an MP in 2005. He is shadow London minister.A close ally of former Labour leader Ed Miliband, Mr Khan served in junior ministerial roles in Gordon Brown's government.A familiar face to viewers of BBC One's This Week, Diane Abbott is a veteran left winger who first entered the Commons in 1987, as one of Britain's first black MPs.The Hackney North and Stoke Newington MP was shadow public health spokesman under Ed Miliband, after losing out to him in the 2010 Labour leadership contest.Launching her mayoral bid, she said she would bring London's communities together and be the ""genuinely independently minded Mayor that London needs"".""Hard times call for a campaigning Mayor. Now more than ever our city needs a Mayor who will stand up for the interests of those increasingly left behind,"" she added.A journalist and railway historian, Christian Wolmar is one of Britain's most in-demand transport pundits.The only non-politician in the race, he campaigns against the construction of HS2 and has vowed to tackle London's ""housing crisis"", improve the transport network and revitalise public spaces.""Instead of partisan and personality politics London needs a dedicated, ideas driven mayor who works for Londoners and their needs,"" he said.The 65-year-old cycles to campaign meeting and claims to have clocked up more than 2,000 miles already.Chuka Umunna was the second candidate to declare he would stand for election as leader of the Labour Party.A rising star of the party, Mr Umunna was first elected to Parliament in 2010 and appointed shadow business secretary the following year.He has retained the seat of Streatham with a majority of nearly 14,000 and a vastly increased vote share this time round.He announced his intention to stand via a post on his Facebook page. He said he had spoken to half the Labour 80 candidates standing in Tory seats targeted by the party and other MPs before making his announcement. However, three days later Mr Umunna withdrew from the leadership contest. He said in a statement posted on his Twitter feed that had been uncomfortable with the level of ""sheer pressure"" and scrutiny that came with being a candidate.The 36-year-old added that it had perhaps been ""too soon"" for him to launch a leadership bid.Another rising star of the 2010 intake, the MP for Leeds West was appointed shadow chief secretary to the Treasury in 2011 and shadow work and pensions secretary in 2013.During the election campaign, she attacked the so-called bedroom tax, whereby housing benefit payments are reduced for tenants in council and social housing deemed to have spare rooms.However, she also suggested Labour would consider reducing the overall welfare cap in some areas.She told BBC News Labour needs ""to be in the centre ground to win a general election"" but ruled herself out of a leadership bid.A former home secretary and shadow chancellor, Alan Johnson is the Labour leadership candidate who never quite was.The popular MP declined to stand in 2010 and stepped down from his shadow cabinet role in 2011 for personal reasons.Earlier this year it was reported that senior New Labour figures Lord Mandelson and Alistair Campbell approached Mr Johnson over a leadership bid, although all three later distanced themselves from the story.But the former postman, who has been MP for Hull West and Hessle since 1997, had seemingly ruled himself out again, saying it is a ""10-year job"" and he does not have the ""right qualities"". Former army officer Dan Jarvis was elected MP for Barnsley Central in a by-election in 2011, having resigned his commission as a major in the Parachute Regiment to contest the seat.He held onto his seat at the general election, taking time out from campaigning to run the London Marathon last month.After entering Parliament in 2010, he quickly became a shadow culture, media and sport minister and later a shadow justice minister.In 2011, Mr Jarvis became the first serving politician in more than 60 years to be awarded a military honour, when he was made an MBE for his services to the armed forces.He has been touted by some colleagues as a future Labour leader but Mr Jarvis, who was widowed in 2010 and has a young family, ruled himself out, saying it is not the ""right time"" for him and his family. Historian and journalist Tristram Hunt entered Parliament in 2010 as Labour MP for Stoke-on-Trent Central.Ed Miliband made him shadow education secretary in 2013 and he has been a fierce critic of the coalition's education policies in England.Speaking in the aftermath of the election results, he called on Labour's ruling National Executive Committee ""not to rush our election"", saying there was time for a ""brutal post-mortem"" about Labour's ""underlying philosophy and thinking"".As for his own ambitions, he said ""it's about the lyrics as much as the lead singer I think"".He later said he was not confident of getting enough nominations to stand, and would support Liz Kendall.The MP for Rochdale says the deputy leader vacancy has ""come a bit too soon"" for him.He previously said a number of colleagues had asked him to put his name forward for the role.Mr Danczuk is well known for his prominent campaigning against child sex abuse and leading calls for an inquiry into allegations of historical child sex abuse by senior figures at Westminster.He was a vocal critic of Ed Miliband and in an article for the Daily Telegraph on Thursday he said Labour needed to ""step out if its Metropolitan comfort zone"" and ""reach out to the country once more.""The former director of public prosecutions has only just become an MP after being elected in Frank Dobson's old seat of Holborn and St Pancras, in North London at the general election.He was forced to rule himself out of the race to be Labour leader following a social media campaign urging him to stand.He said he was ""flattered"" by the campaign but the party needed someone with ""more political experience"".The older brother of ex-leader Ed, David Miliband was frontrunner to replace Gordon Brown in 2010, until his sibling beat him by a whisker.A former foreign secretary and MP for South Shields, he was the Blairite choice for leader but eventually quit Parliament to become head of the International Rescue Committee charity in New York in 2013.Speaking to the BBC from the US on the Monday after the general election, Mr Miliband criticised his brother's campaign in the 2015 general election, saying he and Mr Brown had ""allowed themselves to be portrayed as moving backwards from the principles of aspiration and inclusion that are the absolute heart of any successful progressive political project"".While he acknowledged the two men were ""brothers for life"", he also confirmed he was not eligible to stand for the party leadership as he is not an MP.Labour's election rulesMPs wishing to stand as leader and deputy leader have to be nominated by 15% of their colleagues in the Parliamentary Labour Party to be eligible to stand.As Labour now has 232 MPs, this means prospective candidates must get at least 34 signatures. That means the maximum size of any field is six contenders.Under rules agreed last year, all Labour Party members, registered supporters and affiliated supporters - including union members - will be allowed a maximum of one vote each on a one member, one vote system. When the election is held, they will be asked to rank candidates in order of preference.If no candidate gets 50% of all votes cast, the votes will be added up and the candidate with the fewest votes eliminated. Their 2nd preference votes will then be redistributed until one candidate has 50% of all votes cast."

2015-05-26,Round-up: BBC experts' analysis,https://web.archive.org//web/20150526223055/http://www.bbc.com/news/election-2015-32650417,"The political future of the United Kingdom has become clearer after the results of the general election emerged around the country.David Cameron says he hopes to govern for all of the UK after the Conservatives took 331 seats - enough to form a slender majority in the Commons.Labour has been all but wiped out by the SNP in Scotland and suffered a disappointing set of results elsewhere, while the Lib Dems are left with just eight MPs after many party heavyweights such as Vince Cable and Danny Alexander lost their seats.So with battles won and lost and the fall-out and celebrations beginning, BBC correspondents examine the implications and challenges that lie ahead for the new government - and for those whose political careers have been ended by voters.No pollster, no pundit, no political leader saw it coming - not even David Cameron himself.Governing parties don't gain seats. Parties that have implemented painful cuts and are promising more certainly don't. Until that is the Conservative Party did - achieving what had seemed to be Mission Impossible - a Tory majority.Until that is David Cameron's personal triumph which triggered the near simultaneous resignation of his three principle opponents - Messrs Miliband, Clegg and Farage.They did so in part because they helped to crush their partners in coalition these last five years - reducing the Liberal Democrat parliamentary party to a size when it can fit into two London taxis and still have two seats to spare.In part because the extraordinary tidal wave of support for the SNP swept dozens of once safe Labour seats away.In part because Nigel Farage persuaded millions to vote for him but secured just one seat - not, though, the one he was standing in.Read more from Nick Robinson hereThe question uppermost in the prime minister's mind as he assembles his new government is how to keep the kingdom united.""Above all I want to bring our country together,"" he revealed after the result, ""to reclaim a mantle we should never have lost - the mantle of one nation, one United Kingdom"".Looking at the political landscape from Land's End today is very different to the view from John O'Groats.A sea of Conservative and Unionist blue dominates the scene across much of England, while a field of SNP nationalist yellow stretches to the horizon and beyond from the north.David Cameron's greatest challenge is to prevent the union he supports being torn apart by mutual resentment - resentment from Scotland at a Westminster government dominated by English Tories, and resentment from England at the preferential treatment people think is being given to the Scots.Those who assumed the future of the Union had been safeguarded by the Scottish referendum must think again.Read more from Mark Easton hereOne thing is rock-solid true: the Conservatives who worked on this campaign are as surprised by the result as the pollsters, pundits, politicians and general population.Maybe they shouldn't be - the economy is in good shape and the Conservatives had incumbency advantage.But when I travelled back from the prime minister's last rally with a group of exhausted Conservative campaign officials it was clear that 290 seats was a hoped-for target.No-one talked about anything over 300 seats, and no-one even mentioned an overall majority.So what special sauce pushed David Cameron into No 10 with a Commons majority?Mr Cameron had two simple messages in the campaign and he rarely veered away from them; the first - the economy is in good shape and the recovery is threatened by Labour. And the second - the SNP would hold a Labour-led government to ransom.Read more from Jonny Dymond hereBrian Taylor, BBC political editor, ScotlandOf all the comments on the overnight apocalypse, undoubtedly the most straightforward came from a defeated Scottish Labour MP.Since there were quite a few of them, let me narrow the focus a little. Come on down, Tom Harris.Mr Harris had plainly anticipated defeat. Nonetheless, he looked suitably lugubrious as his fate was confirmed.Why, he was asked eagerly, had Labour lost? ""Because we did not win enough votes.""Psephologically, it is perfect. Complete in itself. Psychologically, it sums up Labour's gloom without descending into subsidiary matters such as leadership, strategy and the rest. As a forward-thinking strategy, it is ideal. Win more votes. Simple.Read more from Brian Taylor hereThis has been an election which may have more profound consequences than almost any in living memory.We now face a generational decision about our future in Europe, with an EU referendum in two years' time almost certain.There will also be serious questions about the future of the Union, following an SNP landslide that has turned Scotland into a virtual one-party state.David Cameron's victory also represents a colossal achievement.Only once before in recent history has an incumbent government increased its majority - and that was Mrs Thatcher in her prime in the 1980s.It is also a significant personal victory for Mr Cameron and a rebuff for those in his party who had become increasingly sceptical about his ability to win.But while it may represent a defeat for those Tories who saw this election as a potential opportunity to rid themselves of David Cameron, he must now govern with a wafer-thin majority.For the SNP, their stunning victory can only increase the pressure on Nicola Sturgeon to include a commitment to a second independence referendum in her party's manifesto for next year's Scottish elections.It is an election which has not just defied all the predictions of the pollsters and pundits - but which may yet prompt the most fundamental re-casting of British politics for a generation.Read more from Norman Smith hereAfter an extraordinary night, some brief conclusions:Read more from James Landale hereIs this the end of the union?That is the question many people will be asking this morning after the party which has fought for Scottish independence for 80 years swept to victory.The answer from the jubilant Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon is a firm ""No"".She insists that her MPs will speak for all of Scotland, not just for the 45% who voted for the country to leave the United Kingdom last September.In the closing hours of the most extraordinary election campaign which anyone in Scotland can remember, Ms Sturgeon turned to talk of ""legitimacy.""That will be her watchword in the coming days as she argues that the prime minister cannot ignore the democratic will of the Scottish people.Politically, Scotland and England this morning look and feel like very different countries.Read more from James Cook hereAfter weeks of chatter about an election too close to call, it wasn't that close at all.David Cameron will be continuing as our prime minister.So, what is all this likely to mean?A referendum on whether the UK stays in, or leaves, the European Union, within the next two-and-a-half years.A race to be the next leader of the Labour Party.A race to be the next leader of the Liberal Democrats.And a huge new presence of Scottish National Party MPs at Westminster.And so here's another thing we know for certain this morning: Politics ain't going to be boring any time soon.Read more from Chris Mason hereFor Labour the story of their terrible night is rapidly turning into the search for a new leader. So who will that be?Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, is almost certain to run.  Even before this election, both he and another almost inevitable candidate, Chuka Umunna, had raised eyebrows inside the party at the work they had put in, preparing the ground with members and the unions for potential bids.Yvette Cooper, before the election, was still thought not to have made up her mind over whether to run. That decision has been made perhaps a little easier as her husband, Ed Balls, has lost his seat.She is certainly potentially in the frame, along with two lesser known names - Liz Kendall and Dan Jarvis - two MPs who were only elected in 2010 for the first time. This could be their moment. But whoever is in the job, they face a monumental task.Read Laura Kuenssberg's Twitter hereSterling is up (the most for seven years against the euro), share prices are up (especially bank shares like Lloyds and RBS, and energy shares such as Centrica), government bond prices are up.To state the obvious, investors love the Tories' general election victory.There are a few reasons.One (no surprise here) is that Labour's threat of breaking up banks and imposing energy price caps has been lifted.Second is that investors have been discounting days and weeks of wrangling after polling day over who would form the government - and so they are semi-euphoric that we already know who's in charge.Third, many investors tend to be economically conservative and instinctively Conservative.But although the City may be a bit drunk on the result, its pleasure in Ed Miliband's and Ed Balls' humiliation may be making it a bit blind - perhaps dangerously so - to some bumps in the economic road ahead.Read more from Robert Peston hereNigel Farage dreamed of holding the balance of power, but in the end his UKIP party is now worse off than when it came into the election.At the seventh time of asking he was rejected - this time by the people of Thanet South. It was a similar story in Rochester and Strood where Mark Reckless, who sensationally defected from the Tories last year, was also sent packing.In seats on UKIP's target list, like Thurrock in Essex, the party failed to make gains. In Grimsby - where Mr Farage went twice in the last six weeks - they came third.UKIP got around four million votes - with especially strong showings in north-east and south-east England - but it's ended up with just one MP, and a vacancy at the top. This has led to UKIP attacking the current system of choosing MPs, which it's described as ""busted"" and ""dysfunctional"".In one sense, this campaign was a complete failure and it's left an aftermath of angry voters, and others wondering if the UKIP bubble has burst.Read Robin Brant's Twitter hereI monitored 91 GB-wide voting intention polls during the 2015 election campaign and found nothing in them to prepare me for the final outcome.The good news for the pollsters was that their share for the Lib Dems was pretty close, as were the shares for UKIP, the Greens and the catch-all category of Others.The bad news for the polling industry was that the crucial shares for Conservative and Labour were the ones where they came most adrift.When all the qualifications of margins of error are allowed, there did appear to be a systematic overstatement of the Labour share and an equally systematic understatement of the Conservative one.It is for the pollsters to decide whether to conduct a review of their performance but I trust they will avoid the initial knee-jerk reaction of the immediate aftermath of the 1992 polls debacle.This general election performance follows the performance of the polls in the 2014 Scottish referendum where the choice was simply binary and yet all the polls were out by between 4-6%.Something is wrong. A lot of us would like to know what it is.Read more from David Cowling hereThe words ""political earthquake"" have been translated into numerous European languages, making front page news across the continent.While Britons now examine the domestic minutiae of the election result, here in mainland Europe the vote means one thing: a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU. And that has the potential to create an earthquake of its own.The guardian of the EU treaties Mr Cameron wants to change - Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker - has said again he'd listen to what Britain's new government proposed.Read more from Katya Adler here"

2015-05-26,"EU referendum: What, when and why?",https://web.archive.org//web/20150526223055/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"The UK is set to have a referendum by the end of 2017 on whether or not to remain a member of the European Union.The Conservatives' election manifesto promised to hold a referendum (a nationwide vote) on whether or not the UK should stay in or leave the European Union. They won the election so it's all systems go.A referendum is basically a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part, normally giving a ""Yes"" or ""No"" answer to a question. Whichever side gets more than half of all votes cast is considered to have won.The European Union is an economic and political partnership between 28 European countries. It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, its own parliament and it now sets the rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things like mobile phone charges.The one thing we know for sure is that Prime Minister David Cameron has said it will happen by the end of 2017. The most likely times of the year for referendums are generally May or September, and some people think it should be held as soon as possible - possibly even in May 2016, to coincide with elections in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and London, rather than waiting for 2017. When David Cameron announced in January 2013 his pledge to hold a referendum, a key element was that he would seek to make changes to the way the European Union works - or at least the rules covering the UK as a European Union member. Only once this renegotiation of British membership had been completed would he put the new arrangement to the public vote.During the election the Lib Dems and Labour both said they did not want a referendum unless there were plans to transfer more powers from the UK to the EU. Labour has since dropped its opposition, so the Conservatives are expected to get their Referendum Bill passed easily. The House of Lords could delay it, but as the referendum was promised in the Conservative election manifesto (a manifesto is a document setting out what a party would do if they won the election) it is not likely to reject the bill once MPs back it.The question is always crucial in any referendum and there is already debate about what it should be. The 2013 suggestion from the Conservatives was: ""Do you think that the United Kingdom should remain a member of the European Union?"" Some people thought this phrasing leaned too far towards the status quo - the current state of affairs - and the Electoral Commission, which has to approve the question, said it was not clear enough and proposed:""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union?""Read more: Does the wording of a referendum question matter?British, Irish and Commonwealth citizens over 18 who are resident in the UK, along with UK nationals who have lived overseas for less than 15 years. Members of the House of Lords and Commonwealth citizens in Gibraltar will also be eligible, unlike in a general election. Citizens from EU countries - apart from Ireland, Malta and Cyprus - will not get a vote.Mr Cameron is not revealing the full details of what he wants from the other EU leaders ahead of negotiations - but he is expected to demand an opt-out from one of its core principles of forging an ""ever-closer union"" between member states. He will also try to get restrictions on welfare benefits - in particular, tax credits - for migrants and more powers to block or opt out of new EU laws.Read more: Q&A: What Britain wants from EuropeBritain had a referendum in 1975 shortly after it had joined the EU, or the Common Market as it was then called. The country voted to stay in then but there have been growing calls, from the public and politicians, for another vote because, they argue, the EU has changed a lot over the past 40 years, with many more countries joining and the organisation extending its control over more aspects of daily lives. David Cameron initially resisted these calls but in 2013 he changed his mind.About 33% of the British public, according to the latest opinion polls. The UK Independence Party, which won the last European elections, and received nearly four million votes, 13% of those cast, in May's general election, campaigns for Britain's exit from the EU. A fair number of Conservative MPs - and several Labour ones - are also thought to be strongly in favour of leaving.They believe Britain is being held back by the EU, which they say imposes too many rules on business and charges billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also want Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. They also object to the idea of ""ever closer union"" and the belief that the ultimate goal is to create a ""United States of Europe"".David Cameron wants Britain to stay in the EU, once he has got some powers back from it. He has so far refused to say whether he would start calling for Britain to leave if he does not get what he wants from the other EU leaders. The Labour Party, SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems are also in favour of staying in. Latest opinion polls suggest 45% of the British public agree with them.They believe Britain gets a big boost from EU membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argue, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also believe Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving.It depends which way you look at it - or what you believe is important. Leaving the EU would be a big step - arguably far more important than who wins the next general election - but would it set the nation free or condemn it to economic ruin? Here is a rundown of the arguments for and against.Big business - with a few exceptions - tends to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. The CBI president and BT chief Sir Mike Rake says there are ""no credible alternatives"" to staying in the EU. But others disagree, such as Lord Bamford, chairman of JCB, who says an EU exit would allow the UK to negotiate trade deals as our country ""rather than being one of 28 nations"". Many small- and medium-sized firms would welcome a cut in red tape and what they see as petty regulations, but a lot hangs on what deal Mr Cameron renegotiates. The British Chambers of Commerce says 55% of members back staying in a reformed EU.Find out more: Business for Britain wants big changes to the UK's relations with the EU and says the UK should be prepared to vote to leave if the changes are not achievedBusiness for New Europe is a coalition of business leaders who support the UK's membership of the EU and ""oppose withdrawal to the margins"".The Electoral Commission will be in charge of making sure it's a fair contest.  There will be official ""Yes"" and ""No"" campaigns, selected by the Commission, which will have to abide by strict spending limits. Anyone wanting to launch their own Yes or No campaign will have to register with the Commission if they plan to spend more than £10,000. They must be UK-based. The Commission says MPs should decide what kinds of organisations should be allowed to take part. Business groups, trade unions and pressure groups are all likely to want to have their say.There will also be rules to prevent organisations trying to get round the spending limits through multiple registrations. Political parties will also be allowed to campaign for the result they want to see.Anyone who runs an unregistered campaign will be limited to spending less than £10,000. The idea is to prevent wealthy foreigners, companies or governments trying to influence the outcome. The Electoral Commission has published preliminary guidelines.That is yet to be decided and will partly depend on what Mr Cameron achieves in his renegotiation of the terms of the UK's membership of the EU. He says he is confident he can get what he wants, in which case he would be expected to lead the ""staying in"" side. The highest profile supporter of leaving the EU is UKIP leader Nigel Farage, but there are likely to be other high profile politicians who support withdrawal - or, as with the anti-euro campaign a few years back, celebrities or business people could front an ""anti-politics"" campaign.Conservatives' election manifesto - including referendum pledgeTry these features:How to win a referendumWhat David Cameron wants from the EU negotiationsTimeline: Campaigns for a European Union referendumBusinesses give their views on a possible EU exit"
2015-05-26,What Britain wants from Europe,https://web.archive.org//web/20150526223055/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32695399,"David Cameron says he has a mandate to pursue EU reform following the Conservatives' general election victory. The PM, who will be hoping his majority government will give him extra leverage in Brussels, wants to renegotiate the terms of the UK's membership ahead of a referendum by the end of 2017. He has said he will campaign for Britain to remain in the EU if he gets the reforms he wants.Mr Cameron has said he does not want to reveal full details of his negotiating hand but he has given a broad indication, in a series of speeches and newspaper articles, of his priorities when he goes into talks with other EU leaders.These are: The prime minister has said Britain would resist any move towards a European Army and that he wants to free British police forces from EU interference. He has also ruled out Britain joining the euro.But he has placed less emphasis in recent years on demanding changes to EU social policy, such as the maximum 48-hour working week, agency workers, maternity leave and non-discrimination rules.The official UK government position is that a referendum will be held by the end of 2017 but Downing Street sources have said: ""If we can do it earlier we will.""There is speculation David Cameron is planning to hold the vote in 2016 to avoid a clash with French and German elections in 2017.The prime minister wants treaty change but even if the referendum was held in 2017 there may not be enough time to legally incorporate any reforms into a treaty and it would have to be done at a later stage.An early referendum would anger Eurosceptics who believe it would not allow enough time to make the case for exit or negotiate any meaningful concessions.""A rushed process would severely undermine the chances to secure a significant deal that both British business and voters could support and would waste the opportunity of a lifetime,"" Matthew Elliott, chief executive of Business for Britain told Breitbart London.The question is always crucial in any referendum and there is already a debate about what it should be. The Draft European Union (Referendum) Bill, published by the Conservatives in 2013, proposed this form of words: ""Do you think that the United Kingdom should remain a member of the European Union?""Some thought that leaned too far towards the status quo, encouraging a yes vote, and the Electoral Commission said it was not clear and direct enough. The watchdog proposed this form of words instead: ""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union?""The new Conservative government will attempt to repeal the Human Rights Act, which requires UK courts to treat the European Court of Human Rights as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. The European Court of Human Rights is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe (CoE), which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine.The freedom for people to move around Europe, enshrined in the EU treaties, works in parallel with the other three basic freedoms in the single market: freedom of goods, capital and services.It is likely to be a ""red line"" for other EU leaders, who do not want to see it eroded.Mr Cameron has steered clear of tackling it directly - for example by asking for an emergency ""brake"" on free movement, or a cap on numbers - focusing instead on reducing the incentive provided by welfare payments. In a speech last November, David Cameron set out measures to reduce the number of EU nationals moving to the UK.His main proposals were:Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission, has said he is ready to work with Mr Cameron to ""strike a fair deal for the United Kingdom in the EU"". The leaders of other EU nations have previously warned they are unlikely to support major changes to EU treaties to accommodate British demands. But Mr Cameron's general election victory may have given him extra leverage. ""The ball is very much in the court of the UK now,"" a senior EU official told The Guardian. ""It's up to the British to define what they want."" The key figure will be German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is very keen to keep Britain in the EU but has so far been unwilling to make major concessions to enable that to happen. There are fears that a ""pick and mix"" approach to EU treaties would undermine EU cohesion.Mr Cameron has said there is ""no doubt"" his planned reforms will require changes to the treaties governing the European Union. But this would require the unanimous support of all EU members, and may not be possible within the deadline he has set of a referendum before the end of 2017. Any attempt to change EU laws on free movement would meet fierce resistance from some EU nations, particularly Eastern European states. Mr Juncker has said free movement is non-negotiable.Mr Cameron may find it difficult to get unanimous support for his proposals for a four-year waiting period for migrant workers claiming UK benefits. East European EU members would be likely to oppose this, on the grounds that it would discriminate against their citizens.  Attempts to secure opt-outs for the City are unlikely to go down well with other European leaders.However, there are precedents for EU treaty changes to accommodate some countries' specific concerns - for example, the protocol attached to the Lisbon Treaty for Ireland.Mr Cameron has faced repeated calls to say whether he would campaign for Britain's exit from the EU in the referendum if he fails to get what he wants from the renegotiation process. All he has said is that he will ""rule nothing out"". Some Conservative MPs want Britain to leave the EU no matter what David Cameron manages to renegotiate. A larger group are likely to want more concessions than Mr Cameron has so far indicated he is prepared to demand.Senior backbencher David Davis, who was defeated by Mr Cameron for the Tory leadership in 2005, told the Daily Telegraph the majority of the 332 Conservative MPs want Mr Cameron to negotiate an ""opt-out"" power to stop individual EU laws from applying to Britain. The prime minister has said this would be ""impossible"" without Britain leaving the EU.Mr Davis claims as many as 60 Tory MPs would be prepared to rebel and vote for Britain's exit from the EU if the prime minister fails to deliver.Graham Brady, chairman of the Tory backbench 1922 committee, which represents backbenchers, has urged David Cameron to give all Conservative MPs, including ministers, a free vote in the EU referendum.In January, Mr Cameron warned that serving cabinet ministers would have to quit the government if they wanted to campaign to leave the EU if he had secured the reforms to it he wants.In the 1975 referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Economic Community, as the EU was then called, Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson decided to suspend collective responsibility because his cabinet was split on the issue. Ministers were allowed to vote with their consciences and campaign against each other. The majority of them, including Mr Wilson, joined the Yes camp, but left-wingers, such as Tony Benn, played a leading role in the No campaign. The Yes campaign won easily with 67% of the vote."
2015-05-26,UK and the EU: Better off out or in?,https://web.archive.org//web/20150526223055/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32793642,"David Cameron has promised a referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Union by the end of 2017. Here is a summary of the key arguments for and against British membership.If Britain votes to leave the EU, it will have to negotiate a new trading relationship with what would now be a 27 member organisation, to allow British firms to sell goods and services to EU countries without being hit by excessive tariffs and other restrictions.Better off out: Britain could negotiate an ""amicable divorce"", but retain strong trading links with EU nations, say those campaigning for Britain's exit. There are several potential scenarios:Better off in: An ""amicable divorce"" is a pipe dream, pro-EU campaigners argue. France, Germany and other leading EU nations would never allow Britain a ""pick and mix"" approach to the bloc's rules. Norway and Switzerland have to abide by many EU rules without any influence over how they are formed. Negotiating a comprehensive free trade agreement could take years and have an uncertain outcome. And if Britain went for a completely clean break with the EU its exports would be subject to tariffs and would still have to meet EU production standards, harming the competitiveness of British business.The run-up to the EU referendum is likely to be dominated by competing claims about how many millions of jobs will be lost or gained by Britain's exit. All such claims come with a health warning. Coming up with a precise figure is difficult as there is no way of knowing if threats by foreign companies to scale back their operations in the UK would come to pass or, indeed, how many jobs would be created by the reshaped economy that might emerge in the wake of an exit.Better off out: There would be a jobs boom as firms are freed from EU regulations and red tape, say those arguing for an exit, with small- and medium-sized companies who don't trade with the EU benefiting the most. In its recent paper, the EU Jobs Myth, the free market Institute for Economic Affairs seeks to debunk the claim that 3-4 million jobs would be lost if Britain left. ""Jobs are associated with trade, not membership of a political union, and there is little evidence to suggest that trade would substantially fall between British businesses and European consumers in the event the UK was outside the EU,"" it argues. ""The UK labour market is incredibly dynamic, and would adapt quickly to changed relationships with the EU.""Better off in: Millions of jobs would be lost as global manufacturers moved to lower-cost EU countries. Britain's large, foreign-owned car industry would be particularly at risk. ""The attractiveness of the UK as a place to invest and do automotive business is clearly underpinned by the UK's influential membership of the EU,"" said a KPMG report on the car industry last year. The financial services sector, which employs about 2.1 million people in the UK, also has concerns about a British exit. ""The success of the UK financial services industry is to a large extent built on EU Internal Market legislation. To abandon this for some untried, unknown and unpredictable alternative would carry very significant risks,"" said global law firm Clifford Chance in a report by think tank TheCityUK last year.Much would depend on the trade deals Britain managed to negotiate with the EU and rest of the world after its exit. The best-case scenario, according to think tank Open Europe, is that the UK would be better off by 1.6% of GDP a year by 2030. That is assuming the UK carried out widespread deregulation after its exit and managed to strike favourable trade deals. The think tank adds: ""A far more realistic range is between a 0.8% permanent loss to GDP in 2030 and a 0.6% permanent gain in GDP in 2030, in scenarios where Britain mixes policy approaches"".The Centre for Economic Performance, at the London School of Economics, says the worst-case scenario is a 6.3% to 9.5% reduction in GDP, ""a loss of a similar size to that resulting from the global financial crisis of 2008/09"". The best case, according to their analysis, is a loss of 2.2% of GDP.Better off out: Britain would regain full control of its borders. UKIP wants to see a work permit system introduced, so that EU nationals would face the same visa restrictions as those from outside the EU, which it says would reduce population growth from current levels of 298,000 a year to about 50,000. This would create job opportunities for British workers and boost wages, as well as easing pressure on schools, hospitals and other public services. Better off in: Britain might have to agree to allow free movement of EU migrants as the price of being allowed access to the free market. In any case, immigration from the rest of the EU has been good for Britain's economy. The UK's growth forecasts are based, in part, on continued high levels of net migration. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility says the economy relies on migrant labour and taxes paid by immigrants to keep funding public services.The UK's net contribution to the EU, taking into account the rebate, was £11.3bn in 2013. That is more than four times what it was in 2008. It is about the same amount as the UK government spends on transport every year.Better off out: The UK would save billions in membership fees, and end the ""hidden tariff"" paid by UK taxpayers when goods are exported to the EU, caused by red tape, waste, fraud and other factors. Better off in: The UK's contribution to the EU budget is a drop in the ocean compared with the benefits to business of being in the single market. Better off out: The EU is not as important to British trade as it used to be, and continuing turmoil in the eurozone will make it even less so. Even if Britain did not manage to negotiate a free trade deal with the EU it would not be as disastrous as EU-enthusiasts claim, argues economist Roger Bootle in his book The Trouble with Europe: ""It would place the UK in the same position as the US is currently in, along with India, China and Japan, all of which manage to export to the EU relatively easily."" The UK would be free to establish bilateral trade agreements with fast-growing export markets such as China, Singapore, Brazil, Russia and India through the World Trade Organisation. Better off in: The EU is the UK's main trading partner, worth more than £400bn a year, or 52% of the total trade in goods and services. Complete withdrawal from the EU would see trade barriers erected, with car exports to the EU, for example, facing a 15% tariff and imports a tariff of 10%.  ""The idea that the UK would be freer outside the EU is based on a series of misconceptions, that a medium-sized, open economy could hold sway in an increasingly fractured trading system dominated by the US, the EU and China; that the EU makes it harder for Britain to penetrate emerging markets; and that foreign capital would be more attracted to Britain's economy if it were no longer part of the single market,"" the pro-EU Centre for European Reform said in a recent report.Better off out: The UK would remain a key part of Nato and the UN Security Council and a nuclear power, with a powerful global voice in its own right. The Eurosceptic Bruges Group wants an end to the ""discredited"" principle that Britain acts as a transatlantic bridge between the US and Europe, saying the country should make self-reliance its guiding principle.Better off in: Stripped of influence in Brussels, Berlin and Paris, Britain would find itself increasingly ignored by Washington and sidelined on big transnational issues such as the environment, security and trade. America and other allies want Britain to remain in the EU. The UK risks becoming a maverick, isolated state if it leaves.Better off out: Britain would gain full control of its own borders, with migration in and out of the country regulated solely by British law. It would be more difficult for EU citizens to move to the UK, although those already living here are unlikely to be removed. Better off in: A lot would depend on what kind of deal was reached with the other EU nations. Britons may have to apply for visas to enter EU countries and those already living there may face integration rules, such as proving they can speak the language before gaining long-term residency rights. There would also be uncertainty for many EU workers now paying taxes in the UK - what benefits, if any, would they be entitled to?Better off out: The EU has limited power over tax, which is largely a matter for national governments. The exception is VAT, which has bands agreed at the EU level. Outside the EU, the UK would potentially have more flexibility.Better off in:  ""Tax avoidance and evasion will reach crippling levels as our economy becomes increasingly wholly owned by foreign multinationals that make tax avoidance in Britain central to their business strategy,"" argued the pro-European The Observer newspaper in an editorial.Better off out: It would be a major shot in the arm for British democracy as the Westminster parliament regained its sovereignty and reconnected with voters. The country would be free from the European Arrest Warrant and other law and order measures.Better off in: Britons benefit from EU employment laws and social protections, which would be stripped away. Withdrawal from the European Arrest Warrant could mean delays for the UK in extraditing suspects from other European countries; and the UK already has some opt-outs from EU labour law, including the Working Time Directive."
2015-05-26,First Queen's Speech,https://web.archive.org//web/20150526223055/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32815788,"All eyes will be on the Palace of Westminster on Wednesday as the Queen reads out the legislative plans of David Cameron's new government.It will be a chance for the first all-Conservative government for almost 20 years to set out its stall for the next five years. Here's how some other new governments have used their Queen's (and King's) speeches.The 1945 election marked a watershed in British history. The Conservative wartime leader, Sir Winston Churchill, was defeated by Clement Attlee's Labour Party.The state opening of Parliament, on 15 August 1945, came at the end of World War Two, on Victory in Japan Day.King George VI's speech was delivered in the House of Lords, which had been occupied by MPs since the Commons chamber was destroyed by bombs.""Echoes of great events in British history mingled with the rejoicings of victory when the House of Commons assembled this morning in St Stephen's Hall for the state opening of Parliament,"" the Times newspaper reported, noting that Churchill was cheered as he took his seat.""The continuing shortages in the supply of many necessaries, especially houses, food, clothing and fuel, will call for the same spirit of tolerance and understanding which the nation has displayed during the past six years of war.""Key services and industries were nationalised, and Attlee's government ushered in the welfare state and the National Health Service.  India was granted independence.The Attlee government changed the face of British society, creating a new social consensus that was to remain largely unchanged until 1979, but its majority was slashed in 1950 amid public frustration at continued austerity and rationing, and the following year saw Churchill return to power with a comfortable majority.Margaret Thatcher became the UK's first female prime minister, ousting Jim Callaghan's Labour with a 43-seat majority. During the campaign she had promised to cut taxes, reduce public spending and curb the power of trade unions.""My government intend to achieve a fair balance between the rights and duties of the trade union movement.""""Right to buy"" proved extremely popular, with about 1.5m homes purchased under the rules by 2003. It was seen as a major vote winner for the Conservatives in subsequent elections, and in 1985 Labour dropped its official opposition to the scheme.Critics said it contributed to a reduction in the number of available council homes.Meanwhile, Mrs Thatcher's battles with trade unions became one of the defining features of her premiership. Ultimately their power was reduced and membership plummeted.Many of the services nationalised under the Attlee government were privatised.Public spending was slashed, and documents released in 2009 revealed even some Conservative ministers were alarmed at the scale of cuts planned in 1979.Mrs Thatcher was prime minister until 1990, winning three general elections. The Conservatives won one further election and remained in power until 1997.On 1 May 1997, Labour's 18 years in opposition came to an end. Tony Blair's New Labour won a 179-seat majority - the biggest in its history - on a manifesto which not only promised no income tax rises, but also a pledge to stick to Conservative spending plans.""The central economic objectives of my government are high and stable levels of economic growth and employment, to be achieved by ensuring opportunity for all.""""These are only the first steps on a long journey,"" was the Guardian's verdict, adding that ""Labour begins that journey sustained by enormous national delight"".Business leaders broadly welcomed the decision to free the Bank of England, which had divided the Conservatives. The Bank's monetary policy committee continues to set interest rates.Labour got into hot water with its tobacco advertising ban, as it announced an exemption for Formula One and then had to return a £1 million donation from F1 chief Bernie Ecclestone.The Freedom of Information Act remains in place - although Mr Blair subsequently described it as one the biggest regrets of his time in office. The Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly were established after referendums.Labour went on to win two more general elections, with the 2010 election bringing an end to its 13-year tenure.After the general election left no single party in overall control of Parliament, the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats came together to form Britain's first coalition government in 70 years. The result was the coalition agreement, which would form the backbone of the government's legislative programme for the next five years.""Action will be taken to accelerate the reduction of the structural budget deficit.""Contrary to some predictions, the two parties remained together throughout the parliament.Civil liberties measures like scrapping ID cards proved more straightforward than issues where the two parties were on opposite sides of the debate, like the proposed move to the Alternative Vote system, which was resoundingly rejected in a referendum.The government went on to change the structure of the NHS - despite vocal opposition from Labour - and set out details of the HS2 rail line, with construction due to start in 2017.After sticking together for five years, the two parties experienced differing fortunes at the 2015 election - the Conservatives secured an unexpected majority while the Lib Dems lost all but eight of their MPs."
2015-05-26,Bill-by-Bill,https://web.archive.org//web/20150526223055/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32835622,"The Queen's Speech on 27 May will set out the the government's legislative plans for the parliamentary session ahead. What can we expect to feature?This is high up on the list of the government's priorities. David Cameron has promised to renegotiate Britain's terms of membership of the European Union and put it to a public vote by 2017 at the latest. To do this he'll need to publish a parliamentary bill to pave the way for a referendum - so it's a definite to feature in the speech.During the general election campaign, David Cameron vowed to introduce a law guaranteeing no rise in income tax rates, VAT or national insurance before 2020. He said workers already paid enough tax and he would focus on other ways of clearing the deficit, such as reducing the welfare bill and tackling tax avoidance. The PM has also pledged a law to ensure that ""no one working 30 hours on the minimum wage pays any income tax at all"". Writing in the Sunday Telegraph about his first 100 days in office, he said: ""It is a permanent measure to re-write not just the laws of this country but the values of this country. And it will be there as the centrepiece of the first Queen's Speech of my new government.""The government is promising a crackdown on illegal immigration, and has already set out a number of new offences to try to ""control and reduce"" migration to the UK. These include a specific offence of illegal working - with police given the power to seize the wages paid to illegal workers as the ""proceeds of crime"". Among other proposals being considered are new powers for councils to deal with unscrupulous landlords and to evict illegal migrants more quickly, while all foreign criminals awaiting deportation will be fitted with satellite tracking tags. It will also become an offence for businesses and recruitment agencies to hire abroad without first advertising in the UK - a policy which featured prominently in Labour's election manifesto - and a new enforcement agency will be set up to tackle what the prime minister called ""the worst cases of exploitation"".Home Secretary Theresa May has pledged to ban the use of police cells for the emergency detention of mentally ill people under the Mental Health Act. In a speech to the annual conference of the Police Federation in England and Wales, Mrs May also outlined plans to extend police-led prosecutions, overhaul the complaints system, and change the use of bail.We know that proposals to devolve more powers to England's cities will feature in the Queen's Speech. Chancellor George Osborne said as much in first post-election speech, in which he outlined his vision to give English cities powers over housing, transport, planning and policing. He said Greater Manchester - which will take on the powers when electing a mayor in two years - should become a blueprint for other large cities.The new business secretary, Sajid Javid, has said it will be a government priority to reform strike laws. Specifically, it is proposing to ban strike action from taking place unless 40% of all eligible union members vote in favour of industrial action. The government also wants to lift a ban on use of agency staff when strike action takes places. ""That's something we'll give more detail on in the Queen's Speech but it will be a priority,"" Mr Javid told BBC Radio 4's Today programme earlier this month.The Conservatives have said measures on work will be at the heart of their legislative programme, with David Cameron saying during the election campaign that the UK should aspire to ""full employment"". He has pledged legislation on ""day one"" of the new Parliament. Among the priorities will be a push to create two million more jobs and three million more apprenticeships over the course of the Parliament. The boost in apprenticeships is to be paid for by reducing the benefit cap from £26,000 to £23,000.The prime minister has pledged to bring in a bill to ""deliver better schools - with more radical measures to ensure young people leave education with the skills they need"". He said the legislation will ""include new powers to force coasting schools, as well as failing schools, to accept new leadership, continuing the remarkable success story of Britain's academy schools"". The Conservatives want to expand their free schools programme - which Labour opposes, with Mr Cameron committing to creating an extra 270,000 free school places by 2020. Another stated key priority of the Conservative government is childcare. Currently, all three and four-year olds in England are entitled to 570 hours of free early education or childcare a year, which works out as 15 hours each week for 38 weeks of the year. During the election campaign, the Conservatives promised 30 hours from 2017. The prime minister has also said he wants to introduce tax-free childcare for every child.The government has outlined plans for a bill to cut red tape for British business by at least £10bn and, for the first time, independent regulators will be expected to contribute to that target. The bill is also expected to propose a new Small Business Conciliation Service, to help settle disputes between small and large businesses, especially over late payment practices.The prime minister has pledged to include a bill on devolution which would be based on the cross-party Smith Commission agreement on Scottish devolution. The Smith proposals included giving Holyrood the power to set income tax rates and bands, as well as control over a share of VAT and some welfare benefits.The Conservatives have pledged to abolish the Human Rights Act and replace it with a British Bill of Rights. The Conservative manifesto says: ""This will break the formal link between British courts and the European Court of Human Rights, and make our own Supreme Court the ultimate arbiter of human rights matters in the UK.""The government is expected to bring forward a new bill to crack down on radicalisation. It will include new immigration rules, powers to close down premises used by extremists, and ""extremism disruption orders"". Mr Cameron has repeatedly stressed the need to confront and defeat the ""poisonous"" extremist ideology. The proposals are likely to encounter some opposition in the new Parliament on the grounds that some of the plans could infringe people's right to free speech, BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said.This was the bill that the Conservatives' smaller coalition partners, the Liberal Democrats, refused to back in the last Parliament. Current legislation expires in 2016 and will have to be renewed. So now the Conservatives are governing alone, they can bring back what opponents call the snoopers' charter. The previous plans proposed to extend the range of data communications companies have to store for 12 months. It would have included, for the first time, details of messages sent on social media, webmail, voice calls over the internet and gaming, in addition to emails and phone calls. Officials would not have been able to see the content of the messages without a warrant. Currently communications firms only retain data about who people send emails to, and who they ring.Housing was a hot topic during the general election, featuring in all of the parties' campaigns. One of the Conservatives' key pledges was an extension of Margaret Thatcher's Right to Buy scheme to 1.3 million housing association tenants in England - and the government has confirmed this will feature. Under the plans, housing association tenants will be able to buy the homes they rent at a discount. Communities Minister Greg Clark told the BBC the government wanted to extend the opportunity for people to own their home. There will also be help for first-time buyers, with 200,000 starter homes made available to under-40s at a 20% discount - another Conservative manifesto pledge.The Conservatives made several commitments on the NHS during the election campaign - and David Cameron used his first major post-election speech to focus on his plans for the health service in England. He has pledged to boost funding by at least £8bn extra a year by 2020 and to create ""a truly seven-day NHS"". The government is also promising to recruit 5,000 new GPs.David Cameron has pledged to implement ""as fast as I can the devolution that all parties agreed for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland"". Wales Secretary Stephen Crabb has said his officials were writing legislation to transfer further powers to Wales, so these could be included in the Queen's Speech.Could David Cameron throw a bone to his Conservative backbenchers and introduce legislation to repeal the law that bans fox hunting with dogs? The ban has been unpopular in many rural areas since its introduction by Labour in 2004 - and David Cameron has indicated he would like to undo it. Their manifesto stated that a Conservative government ""will give Parliament the opportunity to repeal the Hunting Act on a free vote, with a government bill in government time"".Legislation to introduce a blanket ban on so-called legal highs is expected to feature in the Queen's Speech. The proposal was included in the Conservatives' general election manifesto, which stated: ""We will create a blanket ban on all new psychoactive substances, protecting young people from exposure to so-called 'legal highs'."" A Home Office source told the BBC that the proposal would be enacted upon."
2015-05-26,The Queen's Speech,https://web.archive.org//web/20150526223055/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32816450,"The Queen's Speech is the centrepiece of the State Opening of Parliament, which takes place this year on 27 May. It is one of the highlights of the parliamentary year, full of both pageantry and political significance.What is the Queen's Speech?In a nutshell, it is a list of the laws that the government hopes to get approved by Parliament over the coming year. By convention, it is announced by the Sovereign in the presence of MPs, peers and other dignitaries in the House of Lords.The occasion marks the start of the Parliamentary year and has added resonance after a change of government, with the contents of the Speech highlighting the priorities of new ministers and setting the scene for parliamentary battle ahead.Has there always been a Queen's Speech?Traditions surrounding the State Opening of Parliament and the delivery of a speech by the monarch can be traced back as far as the 16th Century. The current ceremony dates from 1852, when the Palace of Westminster was re-opened after the fire of 1834. There is normally one Queen's Speech every year, although the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition government decided against having one in 2011, arguing that its legislative programme was so extensive that it would require two years to implement. The last government also decided to switch the State Opening from its traditional November date to the Spring.Does The Queen write the Speech?No. It is written by ministers but is delivered by the Sovereign from the throne of the House of Lords on behalf of Her Majesty's government. The Speech varies in length from year to year, depending on the number of actual bills and other items - such as draft legislation and foreign policy objectives - included but normally takes about 10 minutes. The Queen, to whom the document is sent beforehand for signing, also uses the occasion to give details of upcoming visits to the UK by other heads of state and any state visits she is making overseas.Does The Queen come every year?Pretty much but not quite. This will be the 64th time during her reign that she has delivered the Speech. She has been absent on two occasions, in 1959 and 1963, when she was pregnant. On those occasions, the Speech was read by the Lord Chancellor. Is there a lot of pomp and ceremony involved?Yes. The State Opening begins with the Queen's procession from Buckingham Palace to Westminster, escorted by the Household Cavalry - an event which always draws large crowds along the route.The Queen arrives at Sovereign's Entrance and proceeds to the Robing Room. Wearing the Imperial State Crown and the Robe of State, she leads the Royal Procession through the Royal Gallery, packed with guests, to the chamber of the House of Lords.The House of Lords official known as 'Black Rod' is sent to summon the Commons. The doors to the Commons chamber are shut in his face: a practice dating back to the Civil War, symbolising the Commons' independence from the monarchy. Black Rod strikes the door three times before it is opened. MPs then follow Black Rod and the Commons Speaker to the Lords chamber, standing at the opposite end to the Throne, known as the Bar of the House, to listen to the speech.The speech itself is carried into the Chamber by the Lord Chancellor in a satchel. He hands the speech to the Sovereign and takes possession of it again once it has been delivered.Until a few years ago, the Speech was written on a rare form of calf's skin known as vellum. It is now written on high-quality parchment paper. What happens after the Speech?The Queen returns to Buckingham Palace while MPs and peers break for lunch. A couple of hours later MPs reassemble in the Commons to begin debating the Speech. After introductory speeches by two MPs - traditionally one a relative newcomer and the other a long-serving member - the prime minister gets to his feet to ""sell"" the Speech to the Commons, explaining what is in it and what it says about his vision for the country and the changes he wants to make.The leader of the opposition then gets their chance to respond before backbenchers chip in. The debate on what is known as the ""Humble Address"" normally lasts about five days, with a largely symbolic vote taking place at the end.Peers also debate the Queen's Speech but do not vote on it.It is in the Queen's Speech. That means it will happen?Not necessarily. The Queen's Speech is the equivalent of the government's ""mission statement"" for the year ahead but that does not mean everything in it will become law. There are plenty of examples of proposed legislation which fall by the wayside due to political opposition. A recent high-profile example was a bill proposing elections to the House of Lords in 2012, which was withdrawn four months after being announced by the coalition government.In contrast, there are bills which are not mentioned in the Queen's Speech which are subsequently introduced in response to changing circumstances. One example from the last session was a bill allowing female bishops to sit in the House of Lords. There were 11 full bills included in the 2014 Queen's Speech but Parliament ended up approving 26 bills during the 2014-5 session. Traditionally, the first Queen's Speech of a new Parliament tends to contain more bills than later ones as ministers seek to capitalise on the momentum of their party's election victory, at a time when the opposition is often at its most divided."
2015-05-26,Lessons from Wilson,https://web.archive.org//web/20150526223055/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32844483,"Three days after the first general election in 1974, which led to Harold Wilson unexpectedly taking office as prime minister of a minority Labour government, his friend and colleague Barbara Castle sat down in her bolthole, Hell Corner Farm, in the Buckinghamshire countryside to update her diary. ""So here we go for a bumpy ride,"" she wrote. It was, if anything, something of an underestimate of the five years that lay ahead.It was already obvious that day, that a second election would have to be held. After a difficult few months, Wilson went to the country in October and was rewarded with an overall majority of just three seats in the House of Commons. Yet during that spring and summer, despite numerous parliamentary defeats, the government took steps to control inflation, keep mortgage rates down, and reduce VAT.It also introduced legislation on sharing the revenues of North Sea oil more fairly than before, and established a social contract with the trade unions to try to limit strike action through agreed controls on pay rises. Once he had a majority government, the limits that were imposed on Wilson's subsequent ability to manage a competent administration, were more often to come from political problems within his own party than from his slender overall command of the Commons.So it may also prove for David Cameron, recently re-installed as prime minister, but now for the first time as a man with a mandate. He has an overall majority in the House of 12 seats, considerably less than the 76 he could count on in coalition with the Liberal Democrats.But as Wilson and his successor, James Callaghan, found in the 1970s there will be many occasions when some of the smaller parties may willingly pitch in to support the government.February:Labour: Seats won: 301, up 20. Share of vote: 37.2%Conservative: Seats won: 297, down 37. Share of vote: 37.9%Liberal: Seats won: 14, up eight. Share of vote: 19.3%Turnout: 78.8%October:Labour: Seats won: 319, up 18. Share of vote: 39.2%Conservative: Seats won: 277, down 20. Share of vote: 35.8%Liberal: Seats won: 13, down 1. Share of vote: 18.3%Turnout: 72.8%Uncanny political parallels with 1974It was, as Castle predicted, a bumpy ride, but it was also an immensely exciting one. I had already worked at Westminster for three years at the time but I became a lobby correspondent in 1974 and therefore had access to the inside track of the political circuit. It was in the bars and lobbies and restaurants that the planning and plotting and political manoeuvring took place.But the chamber of the Commons itself was also one of the most rewarding places to observe the spectacle of government. Time and time again I can recall sliding into my seat in the Press Gallery, wondering how on earth Wilson was going to get out of whatever the latest crisis was to engulf him. Summoning up the spirit of those fevered times is not difficult in the context of the following: It was perhaps scarcely surprising, as Bernard Donoughue, head of the Number 10 Policy Unit, noted repeatedly in his Downing Street Diaries, that Wilson was cracking open the brandy bottle at noon and knocking it back until late at night. Wilson was a superb operator with a mastery of the House of Commons but the strains took their toll.He became increasingly paranoid about leaks and the press and the security services, about his warring party and supposed colleagues and the fact - yes, Barbara! - that so many of them were keeping diaries with a view to publication. He hated Question Time and needed those brandies just to get through the then 30-minute session once a week. His decision to resign in 1976 astonished the political world at the time but maybe in retrospect it should not have been such a surprise. The Labour government had by then achieved a great deal without the necessity to compromise, except occasionally with its own supporters, but it was hard fought. Four nights a week there would be crucial votes, sometimes a series of votes lasting a couple of hours, from 10pm. It was an administration run by a necessarily powerful Whips' Office and what was to follow under Callaghan would prove even more tense. In early 1977 the Callaghan government lost its overall majority, which had been whittled away in by-elections, and the new leader of the Opposition, Margaret Thatcher, put down a vote of no confidence. It led to negotiations with the Liberal leader, David Steel, at the head of a group of 13 MPs, for the formation of the Lib-Lab Pact. It was an agreement under which the Liberals supported the government in return for policy consultation, and lasted until the autumn of 1978. The Liberals got little from it, apart from a tweak at the black petticoat of power, but by then it was anticipated that Callaghan would shortly call an election.His failure to do so and the subsequent industrial ""winter of discontent"" would lead to Labour being out of government for 18 years.David Cameron is on an electoral honeymoon at the moment but the forthcoming Queen's Speech will give the new Commons a taste of what lies ahead. It will also serve notice to the Conservative government's opponents in the House of Lords, where it is heavily outnumbered by the current composition of the upper House.And then there is, as ever, the question of Europe. The prime minister and his chief whip, Mark Harper, might both find a study of the 1970s quite helpful over the next few days."
2015-05-26,Man overboard,https://web.archive.org//web/20150526223055/http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-32830379,"Harold Wilson died 20 years ago, on 24 May 1995. He would have died many years before that, writes novelist Isabel Wolff, had her family not saved him from drowning. As a child I spent many family holidays on the Isles of Scilly, 28 miles off the Cornish coast. We'd spend our time walking, cycling and, best of all, rock-pooling.  But where we would normally expect to catch a few shrimps and the odd crab, there was one memorable year when we pulled the Leader of Her Majesty's Opposition out of the water.  It was 10 August 1973 and we were enjoying a bike ride around the largest island, St Mary's. I was with my parents, my elder brother Simon, 16, then a pupil at Rugby School, his best friend Robert, and my younger brother, Matthew, who was 10.  As we cycled along a path above an isolated bay, Matthew spotted an empty rubber dinghy racing out to the open sea. As we watched it speed towards the horizon we wondered whose it was and why it was loose.  Suddenly my father said that he thought he'd heard a cry. Sure enough, above the buffeting of the wind we could just make out a distressed male voice. My father cupped his hands and shouted: ""What is your trouble?""  ""I can't get into my boat,"" the voice answered. ""Fetch a dinghy!""  We pedalled down to the bay as fast as we could.  My father yelled: ""We'll get to you in a few minutes. Can you hold on?""  ""Yes - for a bit,"" came the faint reply. While Robert sped off to alert the Coastguard, Simon found a dinghy - but it had no oars. My father hurriedly looked around for a pair but then, further off, saw a wooden ""pram"" dinghy, its oars still in its rowlocks.  He and Simon carried this to the water's edge and, with Simon guiding him, my father rowed out towards a group of motor launches moored about 300 yards from the shore. While they did this my mother, Matthew and I waited on the beach, which was deserted except for a benign looking Labrador chained up by a fisherman's hut.  The dog's name tag said ""Paddy"" and Matthew and I stroked his ears while we anxiously waited for events to unfold.   Twenty minutes later we saw my father and Simon coming back. Hunched between them in the boat was a bedraggled looking, but familiar figure.  ""It's Harold Wilson,"" I said.  As my father rowed towards the quay, the Labour leader suddenly stood up, nearly swamping the boat. He then sat down again until it had docked, and Simon helped him onto dry land.  I vividly recall how shocked he looked. His shorts and shirt were drenched, his hair was plastered to his scalp, his teeth were chattering and his face was white.  He declined my father's offer of further help, including the loan of a bike to get back to his bungalow, but said that he was glad that we'd come along when we did.  My father jovially responded that it wasn't every day one pulled a former prime minister out of the water and that we were happy to have been able to help.  Satisfied that Wilson was all right, we left him with Paddy and cycled away.  As we ate our picnic lunch my father and Simon explained that Wilson had slipped into the sea while attempting to step from his rubber dinghy onto his motor launch.  The dinghy had shot away from him - the dinghy that we'd seen.  Unable to pull himself into the boat, Wilson had been left hanging on to the fender ropes for dear life. He'd told them that he'd been feeling sea-sick and that his arms felt ""numb"" and were ""giving out"".  Simon had stepped on to Wilson's boat and had then hauled the man on to the deck ""like a sack of potatoes"".  Dad then swore us all to secrecy - if the story got out it could ruin the opposition leader's holiday, and our own.  The next morning we went down to Porthcressa and by chance we saw Wilson coming off the beach.   I remember thinking that he'd be happy to see us again - perhaps he'd even ask us to tea? To my surprise I saw a flash of irritation cross his face.   My father greeted him and asked how he was.  He replied that he felt all right, if rather stiff, and that he had spent the rest of the day in bed.  ""I've had my swim for the holiday though,"" he added pleasantly, then he went on his way and we didn't see him again.  Returning home after the holiday we told no-one what had happened but somehow, a month later, the story got out.  First my father was approached by our local paper which made the story a splash: ""Rugby Family Rescues Mr. Wilson From Sea."" This got picked up by the Birmingham Post and within 48 hours my father's face was on the front of every national newspaper.  Headlines such as ""Wilson Snatched From Drowning"" and ""Wilson Rescued in Sea Drama"" amused us, but we were outraged by the Daily Mirror's ""My Dog Tipped me In!""  In a piece of Labour spin, Wilson's press secretary, Joe Haines, had apparently blamed the labrador.  There was even a photo of ""the culprit"", Paddy, who was ""in the doghouse"".  One could see the need for damage limitation - the incident was extremely embarrassing for Wilson, not least because the Prime Minister Ted Heath was a world-class yachtsman. There were cartoons of Heath grinning at the news on board his yacht, Morning Cloud.  My father, a nuclear engineer, was besieged at work by TV film crews and quizzed about his voting habits. ""Lifelong Tory Saves Wilson from Drowning"", announced the Daily Telegraph.  The Times pointed out that the Labour Leader, whose party had pledged to end private education, had been rescued by a public schoolboy.  And so it went on. We put up with myriad jokes of the ""Why didn't you throw him back?"" variety.  In the meantime Haines continued to elaborate on the story.  Wilson, he claimed in the Mirror, was in ""no danger"".  He ""could have swum to the beach"" but was ""waiting for a friend"".  The truth is, Harold Wilson would have died.  Aged 57, he'd been in the cold water, never more than 15C on Scilly, for more than half an hour.  Knowing the strong Atlantic currents, he hadn't dared risk the long swim back to the beach.  Worst of all, in that deserted spot, there had been no-one to hear his cries.   Reflecting on the incident afterwards, my father told us that Wilson seemed not to understand that it was ""only by the slenderest margins"" that his life had been saved.  Six months later, in February 1974, Harold Wilson became prime minister again.It's now 42 years since ""The Wilson Affair"" as my family always called it.  It seems strange that despite all the publicity this very significant event in the life of Wilson is almost unknown.  Neither of his official biographers, Ben Pimlott and Philip Ziegler, mentioned it in their respective books, nor did Joe Haines revisit it in his own memoir of Wilson, Glimmers of Twilight.  I sometimes wondered how Wilson's colleagues had viewed the story at the time. Were they sympathetic? Amused?  Did they pull his leg about it?  ""Oh I remember it well,"" Denis Healey told me when I phoned him in the House of Lords a few months ago. ""Harold seemed very embarrassed by it and was clearly anxious to play the whole thing down.  We didn't feel that we could mention it to him - definitely not.""  And if my family hadn't happened to pass by when we did?  It's fair to say that the course of British politics might have been rather different.  Denis Healey or Jim Callaghan might have succeeded Wilson. Edward Heath might not have been defeated in 1974 and there might well have been no Tory leadership challenge the following year and therefore, quite possibly, no Thatcher premiership.  My late brother, Simon, used to wonder whether our father may, on that fateful August day, have inadvertently launched Margaret  Thatcher's prime ministerial career. The rest, as they say, is history.Isabel Wolff is author of GhostwrittenSubscribe to the BBC News Magazine's email newsletter to get articles sent to your inbox"
2015-05-26,Mark Mardell,https://web.archive.org//web/20150526223055/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32803419,"The UK's future direction for at least a generation hangs precariously on an uncertainty, balanced on the tip of the unknown.I am talking of course about the planned referendum on the EU.  The brilliant thing about referendums, and one of the features that makes them so irksome for politicians is their binary clarity - ""Yes"" or ""No"", ""In"" or ""Out"".This one will be like that, but it isn't at the moment. For now, the most important group of potential voters are the ""Maybes"".They are not unsure because they are hesitant Harrys and Harriets who haven't grasped the big issues.It is much more political than that.  Some big names are rallying around the banner of ""Maybe"".The Foreign Secretary Phillip Hammond is one of them, and perhaps the most important is the mop-headed mayhap Boris Johnson. Their eventual decision depends, they say, on what change in the relationship David Cameron manages to negotiate - and that may well depend on what they and others argue, in political cabinet, he should demand. This is unknown because it is as yet undecided. Indeed, I am fairly sure almost all Conservative MPs will be herded into the ""Maybe"" camp by a twitch of deferent loyalty on one flank, the cracking whip of strategic cunning on the other.Those who know with certainty in their own hearts they will vote ""No"" may feel they have to give the prime minister a chance, or appear grossly disloyal. This has the added advantage that having played the part of a loyalist waiting with open-jawed admiration for the prime minister to return home with a piece of paper, their eventual disappointment will pack more heft. At the end of the process, they can declare that, despite all their high expectations, the deal is not good enough, and the obdurate EU has left them with no choice but to campaign for an ""Out"".  Equally, those who are determined to stay in might as well drape themselves in temporary Euroscepticism and mutter about how hard it is for Mr Cameron to ""squeeze anything out of that lot"".  When Mr Cameron returns with a deal, however paltry,  they can proclaim it a master stroke that forces them into the ""Yes"" camp. Still, some will have a genuine bottom line.It is not clear if the prime minister himself is one of them.He has set out, in rather loose terms, his aims, in the Sunday Telegraph last March.The trouble with most of them is that success would be difficult to measure. We will legislate in the first session of the next Parliament for an in-out referendum to be held on Britain's membership of the EU before the end of 2017. We will negotiate a new settlement for Britain in the EU. And then we will ask the British people whether they want to stay in on this basis, or leave. We will protect our economy from any further integration of the Eurozone. The integration of the Eurozone has raised acute questions for non-Eurozone countries like the UK. We benefit from the single market and do not want to stand in the way of the Eurozone resolving its difficulties.But we will not let the integration of the Eurozone jeopardise the integrity of the single market or in any way disadvantage the UK.We want to see powers flowing away from Brussels, not to it. We want national parliaments to be able to work together to block unwanted European legislation. And we want an end to our commitment to an ""ever closer union"", as enshrined in the treaty to which every EU country has to sign up.What sort of change would ensure ""businesses liberated from red tape"" or ""powers flowing away from Brussels""? Words alone would not suffice for those who think such changes are vital if the UK is to stay in the EU - after all, the European Commission would say it backs both. ""Free movement to take up work, not free benefits"" is more concrete and eminently achievable but may not look like the ""fundamental"" change in relationship that is promised. But ""new mechanisms in place to prevent vast migrations across the Continent"" looks much easier to declare as a ""win"" or ""lose"".After persistent warnings, particularly from German Chancellor Angela Merkel, that ""free movement of people"" was not up for grabs, the prime minister appeared to drop the idea. But he told the House of Commons only two months ago: ""In the coming two years, we have the opportunity to reform the EU and fundamentally change Britain's relationship with it. ""We have the opportunity to build a European Union that is more competitive, more flexible and more accountable to the people, where powers flow back to member states, not just away from them, and where freedom of movement is no longer an unqualified right.""How much would the EU have to qualify that right, to persuade the doubters?Would a promise to stop putative Serbians coming to Britain after their country joins, in perhaps 2030, do the trick? Again, that is unknown and uncertain.At the moment, most backbenchers are keeping their heads down and powder dry. But Jacob Rees Mogg, MP for North East Somerset and member of the European Scrutiny Committee in the last Parliament, told me: ""I think the touchstone for renegotiation will be the free movement of people. ""It is one of the four freedoms of the European Union, and if the EU is  willing to give ground on that it will show that it is willing to consider a fundamental reform rather than just tinkering at the edges. ""So it is symbolically important as well as representing a deep concern of the British people.""This is admirable in its clarity, and I suspect it will be a  touchstone too for many of his colleagues. Others may set the bar higher or lower, but one new MP told me: ""I wouldn't like to be in the prime minister's shoes.""He knows it has to be real - he can't just come back with a bit of polish on it."" The prime minister's challenge is to come back with a deal so bright and sunny that the snows of uncertainty melt away to reveal the sunny uplands of victory. Is that likely? Maybe."

2015-05-27,Bill-by-bill: Queen's Speech,https://web.archive.org//web/20150528020736/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32898443,"The government's legislative plans for the year ahead have been unveiled in the Queen's Speech to Parliament. Here is a guide to the bills that were announced.This will pave the way for an in/out referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union. David Cameron has promised to renegotiate Britain's relationship with the 28-member bloc and put it to a public vote by 2017 at the latest. There is speculation it could be held as early as autumn 2016.This bill, as the name would suggest, is designed to achieve full employment ""and provide more people with the security of a job"". The aim is for two million more jobs and three million new apprenticeships to be created. Ministers will be required to report annually to Parliament on their progress. The legislation will also implement a planned reduction in the welfare cap - from £26,000 to £23,000, and freeze working-age benefits, tax credit and child benefit for two years. As part of the government's welfare reforms, young people will be required to ""earn or learn"", with automatic entitlement to housing benefit for 18-21-year-olds scrapped.Read more details on gov.ukThis bill will include measures to reduce regulation on small businesses in a bid to boost job creation. It will seek to cut red tape for British business by at least £10bn and, for the first time, require independent regulators to contribute to that target. In addition, it proposes to create a new Small Business Conciliation Service, to help settle disputes between small and large businesses, especially over late payment practices. The government also aims to improve the business rates system ahead of the 2017 revaluation, including by modernising the appeals system. And it proposes to introduce a cap on public sector redundancy payments. to six figures for the highest earners.This wide-ranging bill is designed to enact a series of tax pledges made by the Conservatives during the general election campaign. Specifically that there would be no rise in income tax rates, VAT or national insurance before 2020 and that ""no one working 30 hours on the minimum wage pays any income tax at all"". It will also enact a commitment to raise the threshold before which people pay income tax to £12,500 - a move ministers say will benefit 30 million people. The government says the purpose of the bill is to ""reward those who work hard and do the right thing"".A Childcare Bill will include measures to help working people ""by greatly increasing the provision of free childcare"". Under the proposals, parents in England would be entitled to 30 hours a week of free childcare for their three- and four-year-olds, for 38 weeks of the year. Currently, they are entitled to 570 hours of free early education or childcare a year, which works out as 15 hours each week over the 38-week period.Plans to support home ownership and extend the right-to-buy scheme to 1.3 million social housing tenants in England feature in a new Housing Bill. Under the plans, housing association tenants will be able to buy the homes they rent at a discount. There will also be help for first-time buyers, with 200,000 starter homes made available to under-40s at a 20% discount. Both are commitments which were included in the Conservatives' general election manifesto. The government says the bill will increase the housing supply and ensure local people have more control over planning.Measures will be introduced to ""increase energy security"" and ensure there will be ""affordable and reliable energy for businesses and families"". The government proposes to establish the Oil and Gas Authority as an independent regulator, charged with regulation of domestic oil and gas recovery. It would transfer responsibility for giving consent for any large onshore wind farms in England and Wales from Whitehall to local planning authorities.Read more details on gov.ukThe government is promising to ""control immigration"" and put ""hard-working British families first"". Its Immigration Bill is designed to support working people, clamp down on illegal immigration and protect public services. Specifically, it will include a new offence of illegal working - with police given the power to seize the wages paid to illegal workers as the ""proceeds of crime"". There are also proposals to deal with unscrupulous landlords and to evict illegal migrants more quickly, while all foreign criminals awaiting deportation will be fitted with satellite tracking tags. It will also become an offence for businesses and recruitment agencies to hire abroad without first advertising in the UK - a policy which featured prominently in Labour's election manifesto - and a new enforcement agency will be set up to tackle what the prime minister called ""the worst cases of exploitation""Read more details on gov.ukThis paves the way for powers over housing, transport, planning and policing to be devolved to England's cities as part of government plans for ""a balanced economic recovery"". Cities that want them will be able to have elected mayors. Chancellor George Osborne has said previously that Greater Manchester - which will take on the powers when electing a mayor in two years - should become a blueprint for other large cities.The government is pressing ahead with legislation that will eventually enable work to start on the £50bn HS2 high-speed rail link. Legislation which will give the government the legal powers to construct and operate the London to Birmingham first phase of HS2 is going through Parliament. If it progresses smoothly, it should receive Royal Assent around the end of 2016, with work beginning on the project in 2017, with a finishing date of 2026.Read more details on gov.ukThe government will press ahead with further Scottish devolution as part of plans to deliver ""a strong and lasting constitutional settlement"". The Scottish Parliament will be given new tax and welfare powers, under the proposals. It follows the recommendations of the Smith Commission on Scottish devolution.There will also be further devolution of powers to Wales, under the government's plans, including a new reserved powers model to clarify the division of powers between the Welsh Assembly and Parliament. The assembly will also be given more powers over energy, transport and local government elections in Wales.Continuing the devolution theme, there will be a bill to give effect to the Stormont House Agreement in Northern Ireland. It will provide for full and independent investigations into ""unsolved Troubles-related deaths"", the government says.Read more details on gov.ukLegislation to introduce a blanket ban on so-called legal highs featured in the Queen's Speech. The government says the move is to ""protect UK citizens from the risks posed by untested, unknown and potentially harmful drugs"". It would be an offence to produce, supply, offer to supply, possess, import or export psychoactive substances. The proposal was included in the Conservatives' general election manifesto.Read more details on gov.ukThis includes measures to tackle broadcasting of extremist material. The government wants to strengthen watchdog Ofcom so that it can take action against channels that transmit extremist content. The legislation will also propose the introduction of banning orders for extremist organisations who use hate speech in public places, but whose activities fall short of proscription. A new power to allow police and local authorities to close down premises used to support extremism will also feature. And employers will be able to check whether an individual is an extremist and barring them from working with children.""New legislation will modernise the law on communications data,"" the speech said. An Investigatory Powers Bill will revive plans to give intelligence agencies new tools to target communications data - branded a ""snooper's charter"" by critics. The government says it will equip the police intelligence agencies with the tools to keep people safe.The government is promising to ""improve the law"" in this area to make communities ""safer"" and to ""build confidence and improve efficiency"" in the criminal justice system. It includes plans to reform pre-charge bail in England and Wales - with an initial 28-day limit, and to ban the use of police cells for the emergency detention of mentally ill people under the Mental Health Act. There are also proposals to reform the Police Federation in England and Wales, and plans to extend police-led prosecutions and overhaul the complaints system. Measures to beef up child protection also feature.Read more details on gov.ukThe main elements of the Bill are a 50% voting threshold for union strike ballot turnouts, and a requirement that 40% of those entitled to vote must back action in essential public services - health, education, fire and transport. Time limits will also be introduced on a mandate following a ballot for industrial action. The government says the aim is to ensure that strikes are the result of ""clear, positive and recent decisions"" by union members as well as ensuring that disruption to essential public services has a democratic mandate. There will also be the introduction of ""a transparent opt-in process for the political fund element of trade union subscriptions"", along the lines of the Northern Ireland system. Read more details on gov.ukThis bill is designed to raise standards in schools. Under the plans, new powers would be brought forward to speed up the process of changing a failing school's leadership and turning it into an academy. Those considered to be ""coasting"" - not performing as well as they could be - would also face being taken over. The bill will also give the education secretary new powers to force local councils to hand over their responsibilities for adoption to another authority or agency.This bill is designed to continue in force the legislation governing the Armed Forces. It would also make provision for other defence matters. Read more details on gov.ukThis piece of legislation is designed to ""further strengthen"" the governance and accountability of the Bank of England, according to the government. It will include measures working towards aligning monetary policy, macro prudential policy and micro prudential regulation. Read more details on gov.ukMeasures to protect charities from abuse and to strengthen the powers of the Charity Commission for England and Wales feature in this bill. It is also designed to enable charities to more easily undertake social investments. Read more details on gov.ukThe speech set out plans for legislation to scrap the current 15-year time limit on UK citizens living abroad voting in Westminster and European elections. The government says it would make it easier for overseas electors to cast their votes in time to be counted, and encourage larger numbers of British citizens living abroad to register to vote in UK elections. Read more details on gov.ukThe purpose of this bill is to give UK approval to the financing aspect of the seven year EU Budget deal agreed in 2013, which saw a real-terms cut in EU spending. It would preserve the UK's rebate, and prevent new EU-wide taxes to finance EU spending, the government says. Read more details on gov.ukThis bill would provide the option for combined authority areas with directly-elected mayors to be responsible for the running of their local bus services. The government says the move would allow cities to promote an integrated transport system. Read more details on gov.ukThis is the one draft bill to feature in the Queen's Speech. It proposed to reform and modernise the Public Service Ombudsman sector to provide ""a more effective and accessible final tier of complaints redress within the public sector"". It would absorb the functions of the Parliamentary Ombudsman, the Health Ombudsman, and the Local Government Ombudsman and potentially the Housing Ombudsman.Although it appears in the Queen's Speech, there is no legislation, either in full or draft form, on a British Bill of Rights. Instead, ministers will consult on the pros of replacing the Human Rights Act with a new legal framework of rights and responsibilities. There is no mention of any plan to repeal the ban on hunting of wild mammals with hounds, in force since 2005. Ministers have suggested MPs will be given an opportunity to decide on the matter by 2020, and will be given a free vote. "
2015-05-27,MSPs reject Assisted Suicide Bill,https://web.archive.org//web/20150528020736/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32887408,"MSPs have rejected the Assisted Suicide Scotland Bill by 82 votes to 36 following a debate at Holyrood.The bill would have allowed those with terminal illnesses to seek the help of a doctor to end their own life.Supporters said the plan had widespread public backing but critics argued a change in the law would be unethical.MSPs were given a free vote. The Scottish government did not support changing the law. Find out whose side your MSP was onThe  Assisted Suicide Bill was originally brought forward by the late independent MSP Margo MacDonald, who died last year after a long battle with Parkinson's disease.It was taken up by Green MSP Patrick Harvie, who said he gave a commitment to Ms MacDonald to present this bill as best he could to parliament.A Holyrood committee recently concluded that the bill contained ""significant flaws"" and opposed its general principles, but said the full parliament should decide whether or not to throw out the proposed legislation.After the vote, Mr Harvie said he hoped the government would ""recognise the strong demand for clarity in law"".He added: ""It's clearly a disappointment that the Bill will make no further progress.""The significant support in the chamber reflects the clear public desire for people to have choice and for the law to be clarified.""I know many supporters of assisted suicide will now be hoping that the Lord Advocate issues prosecution guidance and that the Scottish government considers alternative approaches to the problem.""Scottish health secretary Shona Robison had earlier told MSPs: ""The government believes that the current law is clear, and it is not lawful to assist someone to commit suicide, and the government has no plans to change that.""Despite that, she said, Scottish government ministers would be able to vote ""according to their conscience"", before adding that she would not be backing the legislation.Conservative MSP Dr Nanette Milne, a former anaesthetist and cancer researcher who sits on Holyrood's Health Committee, also said she would not be supporting the bill.She said: ""Personally, as a former health professional, the idea of actively and deliberately hastening death by assisting someone to die is deeply disturbing for me. And I share the view of many professional colleagues that to legislate for this would risk undermining patient trust in doctors and medical advice.""But Liberal Democrat MSP Liam McArthur said, while the bill was not perfect, he would support its general principles.He said: ""Over the years I have come to the conclusion that the status quo is no longer tenable, that change is necessary, that finding ways of allowing individuals dignity in death as in life is now essential.""It's a conclusion that growing numbers of people in Scotland have reached, often I suspect based on direct experience of what has happened to a family member or good friend.""The right to life is not the same as a duty to live. This is about providing dignity, respect and choice at the end of life.""It is not illegal to attempt suicide in Scotland, but helping someone take their own life could lead to prosecution.In England and Wales, the Suicide Act 1961 makes it an offence to encourage or assist a suicide or a suicide attempt, which is almost identical to the situation in Northern Ireland.The Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) has to approve any assisted suicide court action in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.In 2010, Keir Starmer, then the DPP, issued guidance that made it clear that family or friends who travelled with a loved one to the Swiss suicide group Dignitas would not risk prosecution.The guidelines were the result of a case brought by Debbie Purdy, a terminally ill woman, who in 2009 won a legal ruling requiring the DPP to set out whether her husband would be committing an offence if he accompanied her to Dignitas to end her life.Scotland's prosecution service, the Crown Office, has issued no such guidance.Assisted suicide is legal in Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Belgium as well as Switzerland.Campaigners who backed the bill, including representatives of the My Life, My Death, My Choice campaign, earlier gathered outside the Scottish Parliament to urge MSPs to support the general principles of the legislation.But a number of organisations, including the Law Society of Scotland, Church of Scotland, Council of Imams Scotland and the Christian charity Care for Scotland, raised objections.Alison Britton, convener of the Law Society's health and medical law committee, said she was concerned the law lacked clarity.She said: ""We have said throughout the passage of this bill that legislation in this area needs to be absolutely clear and those seeking to end their lives, and those who assist them, need a robust and transparent process to be certain under which conditions it would be lawful for assistance to be provided.""We remain concerned over the lack of definition of the key terms, such as ""assistance"" and ""life-shortening"" and the functions of the licensed facilitator are still uncertain.""Lack of such clarity leads to ambiguity and leaves the legislation open to interpretation.""And the Church of Scotland urged MSPs to do more to improve end-of-life care instead of backing the bill.In a letter, Rev Sally Foster-Fulton, convenor of the Kirk's Church and Society Council, wrote: ""We believe that this bill represents much more than simply a tinkering with the law, breaching as it does the societal prohibition on the taking of human life.""It carries implications for the whole of society, not just for those who will seek assisted death, and for attitudes to many aspects of health and social care.""A report of the  debate on the Assisted Suicide Bill can be viewed here.

2015-05-27,Labour objects to Hatton application,https://web.archive.org//web/20150528020736/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32909887,"Labour's general secretary has objected to a bid by former firebrand councillor Derek Hatton to rejoin the party.Mr Hatton, the former deputy leader of Liverpool City Council, was thrown out of Labour in 1986 for belonging to the left-wing Militant faction.The 67-year-old told ITV Granada he had rejoined the party two days after its general election defeat.""I just felt I should do something,"" he said, saying there was now ""no difference between the parties"".However he will need to appeal against the objection, from general secretary Iain McNicol, if he wants to continue with his application.The Militant Tendency, which emerged from a Trotskyist group called the Revolutionary Socialist League, held key positions in the Liverpool Labour Party as it battled the Conservative Thatcher government in the 1980s.After the then party leader Neil Kinnock condemned the council's actions, Mr Hatton, a former firefighter who had been elected to the city council in 1979, was expelled when a disciplinary panel found him guilty of membership of the Militant Tendency and of manipulating the rules of the district Labour Party.Explaining why he had recently decided to rejoin, two days after Labour's election defeat to the Conservatives, Mr Hatton said the party had ""drifted and drifted and drifted"", with ""the same type of Eton/Oxford person going forward"" from the different parties.""People now need to see that there is a clear choice when they go to the booth,"" he said.He said he did not ""for one second"" expect his past to be a barrier to membership, because ""the world is a different place, the Labour Party is a different place, Derek Hatton is a different person"".A Labour spokeswoman said: ""The general secretary of the Labour Party has objected to this application to join."""
2015-05-27,New powers to monitor internet use,https://web.archive.org//web/20150528020736/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32896921,"New laws to give police and spies greater powers to monitor internet and phone use are in the Queen's Speech.Downing Street said that measures in the Investigatory Powers Bill would provide the authorities ""with the tools to keep you and your family safe"".It will ""address gaps"" in intelligence gathering and access to communications data which is putting ""lives at risk"".But civil liberties campaigners claim it will pave the way for mass surveillance of UK citizens.Home Secretary Theresa May's efforts to introduce a similar bill in 2012, dubbed the ""snooper's charter"" by critics, were blocked by the Liberal Democrats.The new bill is designed to ""maintain the ability of intelligence agencies and law enforcement to target the online communications of terrorists, paedophiles and other serious criminals"". Details of how it will work will be published in the next few days.It is thought likely to require internet service providers and mobile operators to log much more data about what their customers are doing, including data on who people call, text, tweet and instant message, what games they play, when they post on social networks and who they send webmails.The government has come under growing pressure to do more to respond to the fallout from the conflicts in Iraq and Syria and, specifically, the threat posed by British jihadists returning to the UK after fighting in the two countries. The police have long argued that their ability to track the online communications of potential suspects is heavily circumscribed and the the law is not keeping pace with advances in technology. But civil liberties campaigners fear it will lead to mass surveillance.Essentially the government wants to upgrade the law so that is can do all the things it used to do with the post and telephones with all the plethora of online communications that now exist.A review by the ""Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation"" David Anderson QC will feed into this. The Bill will be very controversial. It is strongly opposed by many Liberals, and civil liberties groups, and the idea became even more controversial after the Edward Snowden revelations.Jim Killock, executive director of The Open Rights Group, said: ""The government is signalling that it wants to press ahead with increased powers of data collection and retention for the police and GCHQ, spying on everyone, whether suspected of a crime or not.""This is the return of the 'snooper's charter', even as the ability to collect and retain data gets less and less workable. ""We should expect attacks on encryption, which protects all our security. Data collection will create vast and unnecessary expense.""Renate Samson, chief executive of Big Brother Watch, said: ""Whilst the title may have changed from a Communications Data Bill to an Investigatory Powers Bill it will be interesting to see whether the content has radically changed.""We have yet to see real evidence that there is a gap in the capability of law enforcement or the agencies' ability to gain access to our communications data.""The Investigatory Powers Bill is one of 26 proposed laws included in the first all-Conservative Queen's Speech since 1996. The Conservatives are also proposing new steps to tackle extremism, including giving the home secretary new powers to ban extremist groups and allowing the authorities to close down premises being used to ""support extremism"".It will also include more powers for watchdog Ofcom to take action against TV channels that ""broadcast extremist content"".Downing Street said there would be ""appropriate safeguards and oversight arrangements"" and it would take into account a yet unpublished review of existing counter-terrorism legislation undertaken by the independent reviewer David Anderson.

2015-05-27,Staying in 'will be Yes in EU vote',https://web.archive.org//web/20150528020736/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32894220,"Voters in the UK's EU referendum will be asked to choose Yes if they want to remain in the union or No to leave.Prime Minister David Cameron has said the in/out referendum will take place by 2017.A bill paving the way for the referendum was included in the Queen's Speech.BBC political correspondent Ross Hawkins said the precise wording of the question had not been confirmed.But it is expected to allow those who want Britain to remain in the EU to style themselves as the Yes campaign, with the question expected to be along the lines of: ""Should the UK remain a member of the EU?""Our correspondent said: ""What we won't get [in the Queen's Speech], I'm told, is the absolute, finalised official version of that question. There's likely to be more discussion about it, but I'm led to believe that what we are heading towards is a question along the lines of whether the UK should remain in the EU.""That is significant because it would allow those who want the status quo to continue once there has been a renegotiation, who want the UK to remain a member of the EU, to style themselves as the Yes campaign. Yes to stay in, Yes to remain.""So it could be that there is some discussion of that over the coming days.""In the Queen's Speech, Mr Cameron said he would renegotiate the UK's membership and pursue reform of the European Union ""for the benefit of all member states"", pledging ""early legislation"" to pave the way for a referendum by the end of 2017.Downing Street said this would give the public a ""voice and a real choice on Europe"". It has also confirmed that members of the House of Lords and citizens of Commonwealth countries living in Gibraltar will be entitled to vote in the referendum - as well as UK nationals who have been living abroad for less than 15 years."
2015-05-27,Clegg attacks Tories in final speech,https://web.archive.org//web/20150528020736/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32904368,"Nick Clegg has accused the new Tory government of abandoning the values he said had been at the coalition's core.He said it was ""dispiriting if pretty unsurprising"" to see David Cameron's government turn their back on the coalition's ""liberal stance"". The former deputy prime minister also criticised his former partners' ""swagger"" over the EU referendum. And, in his final speech to MPs as Lib Dem leader, he predicted the EU debate would ""devour"" Mr Cameron's party.A contest to replace Mr Clegg is under way after the election left his party with just eight MPs.""My party's presence may be much, much reduced in size, but our mission is clearer than ever,"" said Mr Clegg.He said new data monitoring powers, resisted by his party in government, represented a ""turbo charged snooper's charter"", and said there had not been enough to support social care and house-building.He accused the Conservatives of ditching their commitment to civil liberties.""The human rights we hold dear, our right to privacy in an online age, our future as an open-minded, outward-looking country, are all hanging in the balance again because of the measures announced today,"" he said. ""The previous coalition government's commitment to fairness is weakened,"" he added. Mr Clegg said he sensed ""a slight swagger"" among the Conservatives over Mr Cameron's bid to repatriate powers from the EU, saying the PM was ""ambivalent"" towards the UK's place in Europe.And he called for electoral reform and wholesale changes to Britain's constitution, adding: ""This sort of piecemeal tinkering does not go nearly far enough.""He began his speech, in a half empty chamber, by saying it was ""an unaccustomed surprise"" to speak in the Commons without being greeted by a ""disobliging wall of noise"" from the opposition benches.Following the Lib Dem leader in the Commons, Conservative MP Andrew Mitchell said history would treat Mr Clegg's time as deputy prime minister more kindly than the electorate had."
2015-05-27,Unions: Funding reform is 'partisan',https://web.archive.org//web/20150528020736/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32904362,"Unions have accused the Conservatives of a ""shamelessly partisan attack"" on Labour Party funding with reforms proposed in the Queen's Speech.Under the changes, union members will have to ""opt in"" if they want to pay a political levy as part of their fees, rather than having to opt out.Labour's Harriet Harman said changes to party funding should not be ""rigged in favour of the Tory Party"".The Trade Unions Bill will also feature a minimum turnout for a strike ballot.Trade unions use their political funds to campaign on wider political issues.Currently, once a decision has been taken by ballot to maintain a political fund, individual members have to take a deliberate decision to ""opt out"" if they do not want to contribute.By proposing that trade unionists must now ""opt in"" the object is clear - fewer members are likely to make a conscious effort to do so, so  funds would decrease.This is precisely what happened between 1927 and 1946 when the ""opt in"" system was introduced after the general strike, only to be repealed by the post-war Labour government.But what effect will this measure have on Labour Party funds today?Changes introduced by Ed Miliband mean that those union members who want to be associated with the Labour Party - or, in the jargon, who wish to be ""affiliated supporters"" - must now consciously opt in.It's estimated that affiliation fees from big unions such as UNITE and the GMB will fall substantially as a result.So if the government now applies the same principle to political funds as a whole, this would hit Labour less hard than it would have done before the Miliband reforms. But smaller political funds would also make less cash available to union leaders to make , at their discretion, the separate party political donations on which Labour increasingly depends. The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said no further details were available as the bill was still being worked on.A Unite spokesman said: ""Political funds are already subject to approval being given in regular ballots by unions. Tory hedge fund and multimillionaire donors will face no similar restrictions, leaving boards free to write hefty cheques backing the Tory party.""Absent from the Tory manifesto, there is zero popular mandate for this move which is just one more attack on working people.  It is clear there is no place for trade unions in Cameron's 'one nation'.""Paul Kenny, of the GMB, added: ""This will not deter or silence the voices of millions of working people who have already given their approval for political funds through democratic ballots governed by statute.""Responding for Labour to the Queen's speech, Ms Harman said: ""If there are to be any changes to party funding, it must be on a fair, cross-party basis, not just rigged in favour of the Tory party.""The speech promised reforms of trade unions, to ""protect essential public services against strikes"".These also include pre-announced measures including a 50% voting threshold for union strike ballot turnouts, and a requirement that 40% of those entitled to vote must back action in essential public services - health, education, fire and transport.Time limits will also be introduced on a mandate following a ballot for industrial action.Ministers say this will ensure strikes are the result of ""clear, positive and recent decisions"" by union members as well as ensuring that disruption to essential public services has a democratic mandate."
2015-05-27,Wind farm planning shake-up criticised,https://web.archive.org//web/20150528020736/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32905391,"Energy firms have criticised proposals to give local authorities, rather than ministers, the final say over proposed new wind farms over a certain size.Projects of more than 50 megawatts in England and Wales will no longer be referred to ministers for consent under plans in the Queen's Speech.Renewable firms fear that the change will result in projects being bogged down in local planning battles.But ministers said a more ""democratic"" system would ""empower"" communities. The Conservatives pledged to give local authorities the final say over all onshore wind projects in their election manifesto, arguing that it should be for local communities, not Whitehall, to decide if and where developments are built.The government said it would press ahead with the plan and has included it in a wide-ranging Energy Bill, one of 26 bills announced in its legislative programme for the next year.The Bill would remove the need for the secretary of state for energy and climate change to approve the largest onshore wind farms, with powers being devolved to local planning authorities. Energy Secretary Amber Rudd said the change would ""empower"" local communities.""It's right that local people should have the power to decide whether they want a wind farm in their area, so we're devolving powers out of Whitehall,"" she wrote in a blog post.""My existing consenting powers in relation to onshore wind will transfer to local planning authorities, making decisions on energy more democratic and giving our communities a direct say on these planning decisions.""The changes would not apply in Scotland and Northern Ireland, where different planning regulations apply. The Conservatives have also committed to ending new subsidies for onshore wind farms, arguing that it is a mature technology.'Reckless'Speaking in the Commons on Wednesday, Prime Minister David Cameron said there had been a ""massive"" increase in investment in renewable energy in the past five years, making the UK the largest offshore wind market anywhere in the world.""The last government grew our economy and cut our carbon emissions and this government will do the same,"" he said.British Wind, a partnership of independent energy generators and suppliers, said policies towards onshore wind could have the combined effect of pushing up household energy bills.""The cost of substituting more expensive alternative technologies in place of onshore wind would needlessly add several hundred million pounds every year to energy bills,"" said Ian Marchant, chairman of Infinis Energy. Green Party MP Caroline Lucas said the Queen's Speech was ""devoid"" of plans to tackle climate change.""Will he (David Cameron) reverse his reckless policies which are deepening our dependence on oil and gas and, instead, put our real resources into renewable energy and energy efficiency?"""
2015-05-27,'Metro mayors' able to replace PCCs,https://web.archive.org//web/20150528020736/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-32897288,"Directly-elected ""metro mayors"" will be able to undertake the functions of Police and Crime Commissioners (PCCs) in England, under plans included in the Queen's Speech.PCCs were introduced under the former government to replace the 41 police authorities in England and Wales.But the new government wants to give their powers to mayors, as part of wider plans for devolution to cities.The mayors will also have the option to be responsible for local bus services.However, most areas in England are not expected to have mayors, meaning the majority of PCCs will remain accountable for their police forces.In her speech, written by the government, the Queen said the Cities and Local Government Devolution Bill would ""provide for the devolution of powers to cities with elected metro mayors, helping to build a Northern Powerhouse"".Chancellor George Osborne had previously outlined the plan to devolve powers to cities and create a Northern Powerhouse.In his first post-election speech, he said Greater Manchester would become a blueprint for other large cities.Councils in each area will be able to work together as a ""combined authority"", run by a mayor who is directly-elected by voters, rather than being selected by other politicians.The cities that opt to do this will be given greater powers over housing, transport, planning and policing.Greater Manchester will be run by an elected mayor from 2017, with an interim mayor taking on the role in the meantime.One of the people to put their name forward to be interim mayor is Tony Lloyd, who is already the area's PCC. The other contender is Lord Peter Smith.The legislation outlined in the Queen's Speech is a clear indication the government wants to see the Greater Manchester model adopted more widely.On Friday the ten councils of the Greater Manchester city region will select the first interim mayor. But it will be another two years before there's a vote for the much more powerful directly-elected mayor.The Queen's Speech confirms this will lead to enhanced powers over transport, skills and housing. The role of police commissioner will also be rolled into the new mayor's portfolio.George Osborne has driven this ""Northern Powerhouse"" strategy. He believes devolving political and economic power to the great Northern cities will result in a stronger regional economy.But the plan is predicated on other city regions following suit. A lot of local government leaders remain sceptical about creating metro mayors. But the Chancellor's offer should soon be unambiguously enshrined in legislation.Under the Buses Bill, combined authority areas with directly-elected mayors will be given the option to be responsible for local bus services, in the same way as London Mayor Boris Johnson.The government said this would allow cities to ""promote an integrated transport system, supporting the growth and development of their areas"" with passengers and service at its heart.The Queen's Speech also outlined the government's intention to press ahead with legislation that will eventually enable work to start on the £50 billion HS2 high-speed rail scheme.A second HS2 phase, taking the line north of Birmingham to Manchester and Leeds is also planned, with a finishing date of around 2032/33.However, separate legislation is needed for this phase and as yet, the exact route has not been determined.The plan for greater devolution of powers to cities has already been welcomed by George Ferguson, the directly-elected mayor of Bristol.He would have greater powers under the proposals.""It is time for us to modernise and move away from being one of the most centralised countries in Europe,"" he said.""As Britain's main drivers of growth, our cities are severely hampered by having too few financial and legal freedoms and receive far too little of the benefit of their actions.""Sir Peter Soulsby, the city of Leicester's elected mayor, said it was important for rural areas not to be overlooked.""These proposals make sense in metropolitan areas, but it's important that differences in local political geography are recognised,"" he said.""We already have a directly-elected mayor in Leicester, with a clear mandate - but what's important is that we don't get left out, just because the area around us is more rural than it is in Manchester.""Robert Alden, leader of the Conservative group in Birmingham, said the devolution plans had cross-party support there.""Birmingham City Council is so much bigger than the surrounding authorities and there is often a fear they will be amalgamated,"" he said.""But I think we need the leaders of the bigger councils to be grown up and work together with the district and shire councils, who are absolutely needed to be part of this as well.""He said there were a number of options for the areas West Midlands devolution could cover, which may or may not include Birmingham, Wolverhampton, Coventry and their surrounding areas."
2015-05-27,Blair quits Middle East envoy role,https://web.archive.org//web/20150528020736/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32905468,"Former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair is to stand down from his role as Middle East envoy representing the US, Russia, the UN and the EU, sources confirm.He will leave the role next month after he fulfils ""outstanding commitments"", a source close to Mr Blair told the BBC.Mr Blair, who took the role just hours after leaving Downing Street in 2007, has written to UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon to confirm his decision.He will ""remain active"" in the region in an informal role, the source said.Mr Blair remains ""fully committed to assisting the international community in its work with Israel and the Palestinians to bring about progress on the two-state solution"", they said.""He believes that he can best support these efforts through working with the key regional players, the USA, the EU and others, without any formal role.""By Kevin Connolly, BBC Middle East correspondentNo-one is going to consider Tony Blair's period as Quartet envoy a resounding success. But it can't be written off as a failure either, largely because of the mandate he was given. The role came with considerable media fanfare, but in truth they were big headlines heralding a modest set of responsibilities.It was the envoy's job to bring economic development to Palestinian areas, and there were some successes on improving freedom of movement and mobile phone services. But everyone knows some sort of political progress has to come - stability, if not a proper deal - before the Palestinian economy can really flourish. That never came on Mr Blair's watch. But it wasn't his remit either.Some felt he was too comfortable with the Israelis and that the Palestinians never felt he put in enough hours at the job. His time may not be ending gloriously but it is difficult to hold Mr Blair to account for failure in a region where very few international diplomats have succeeded.Although he did contribute to the political process, Mr Blair felt the post was ""limited"" to supporting the Palestinian people on economic development and strengthening institutions, the source said.But despite the ""political constraints"" of the position, Mr Blair believes ""much has been achieved"" over the last eight years.The former Labour prime minister feels an ""entirely new approach"" is required to find a two-state solution, the source added.  Mr Blair will now ""concentrate on strengthening relations between Israel and the wider Arab world"", which he believes could help ""underpin international efforts to end the ongoing impasse in the peace process"".""He will also focus on encouraging Israel to take measures which will dramatically improve the daily lives of Palestinians in Gaza,"" the source said""He believes that achieving this progress on the ground is an essential prerequisite to strengthening broader Arab-Israeli relations.""James Robbins, BBC diplomatic correspondent, said Mr Blair's time in the role had coincided with ""hope draining away throughout the Middle East peace process"".He said the Quartet of powers was now likely to examine its own role in the peace process - as well as the future role of another possible envoy.""So little has been achieved - arguably nothing has been achieved - in the Israel-Palestine process in the past decade and more, so I think if the Quartet examines its own usefulness it will certainly think twice before rushing to have a new envoy,"" our correspondent added."

And who is vying for the deputy leader job?Shadow health minister Liz Kendall was the first Labour MP to say they wanted a crack at the party's top job, saying a ""fundamentally new approach"" was needed.First elected to Parliament in 2010 as MP for Leicester West and appointed to the shadow front bench the same year, Ms Kendall is seen as a Blairite contender.She is a former special adviser to Harriet Harman and then Health Secretary Patricia Hewitt who has argued for reform of public services.In an interview for The House magazine in January, she said there ""will remain a role"" for private and voluntary firms in the health service, ""where they can add extra capacity to the NHS or challenge to the system"".Could she be a fresh face to lead a change of direction for Labour, or seen as too inside the Westminster bubble?The Labour MP for Leigh since 2001, Andy Burnham has plenty of government experience and is the current bookies' favourite.Mr Burnham served as health secretary under Gordon Brown and previously as culture secretary and chief secretary to the Treasury.He stood for the leadership in 2010 but lost out to Ed Miliband, going on to hold the shadow health brief under Mr Miliband's leadership. He is said to have strong trade union support.Declaring his intention to stand, he said Labour must support the ""aspirations of everyone"".Another former chief secretary to the Treasury - as well as a work and pensions minister under Gordon Brown - Yvette Cooper has been shadow home secretary for the past four years.A strong Commons performer, she has given Home Secretary Theresa May a hard time over matters including passport delays, border controls and extremism.She did not stand to succeed Mr Brown in 2010, in favour of her husband, Ed Balls.Announcing her bid this time around, she said: ""Our promise of hope wasn't strong enough to drown out the Tory and UKIP voices of fear. That's what we need to change.""The shadow international development secretary has announced her intention to join the race for the Labour leadership, via an article in the Daily MailMs Creagh joined parliament in 2005 as the MP for Wakefield, gaining experience in government as an assistant whip in 2009-10.She's also held various shadow cabinet positions in opposition, most notably as shadow secretary of state for environment, food and rural affairs - and transport.Ms Creagh held onto her brief as international development secretary in acting Labour leader Harriet Harman's recent reshuffle of the shadow cabinet.Rushanara Ali announced her intention to run for Labour's deputy leadership claiming the party had become ""unelectable"".She was first elected in 2010 in Bethnal Green and Bow, defeating incumbent MP George Galloway.

Dame Tessa Jowell was a key figure at the heart of New Labour - she once said she would ""jump under a bus"" for Tony Blair.The former Dulwich and West Norwood MP, who stood down at the general election after 20 years in Parliament, earned widespread plaudits for the role she played in London's bid for the 2012 Olympics and her subsequent performance as Olympics minister.She has vowed to bring ""Olympic-like discipline"" to changing London, promising to build more affordable homes.The former culture secretary, who was a psychiatric social worker before entering politics, is seen as one of the frontrunners in the race to be Labour's mayoral candidate, with one poll suggesting she is backed by 40% of Labour supporters.Sadiq Khan launched his bid to be London mayor with an attack on incumbent Boris Johnson, describing him as a ""red carpet mayor, somebody who is fantastic going to openings, great with a flute of champagne in his hands"".""I'd rather roll up my sleeves and fight for all Londoners,"" he added.The son of a bus driver, Mr Khan worked as a human rights solicitor before becoming an MP in 2005.

Now more than ever our city needs a Mayor who will stand up for the interests of those increasingly left behind,"" she added.A journalist and railway historian, Christian Wolmar is one of Britain's most in-demand transport pundits.The only non-politician in the race, he campaigns against the construction of HS2 and has vowed to tackle London's ""housing crisis"", improve the transport network and revitalise public spaces.""Instead of partisan and personality politics London needs a dedicated, ideas driven mayor who works for Londoners and their needs,"" he said.The 65-year-old cycles to campaign meeting and claims to have clocked up more than 2,000 miles already.Chuka Umunna was the second candidate to declare he would stand for election as leader of the Labour Party.A rising star of the party, Mr Umunna was first elected to Parliament in 2010 and appointed shadow business secretary the following year.He has retained the seat of Streatham with a majority of nearly 14,000 and a vastly increased vote share this time round.He announced his intention to stand via a post on his Facebook page. He said he had spoken to half the Labour 80 candidates standing in Tory seats targeted by the party and other MPs before making his announcement. However, three days later Mr Umunna withdrew from the leadership contest. He said in a statement posted on his Twitter feed that had been uncomfortable with the level of ""sheer pressure"" and scrutiny that came with being a candidate.The 36-year-old added that it had perhaps been ""too soon"" for him to launch a leadership bid.Another rising star of the 2010 intake, the MP for Leeds West was appointed shadow chief secretary to the Treasury in 2011 and shadow work and pensions secretary in 2013.During the election campaign, she attacked the so-called bedroom tax, whereby housing benefit payments are reduced for tenants in council and social housing deemed to have spare rooms.However, she also suggested Labour would consider reducing the overall welfare cap in some areas.She told BBC News Labour needs ""to be in the centre ground to win a general election"" but ruled herself out of a leadership bid.A former home secretary and shadow chancellor, Alan Johnson is the Labour leadership candidate who never quite was.The popular MP declined to stand in 2010 and stepped down from his shadow cabinet role in 2011 for personal reasons.Earlier this year it was reported that senior New Labour figures Lord Mandelson and Alistair Campbell approached Mr Johnson over a leadership bid, although all three later distanced themselves from the story.But the former postman, who has been MP for Hull West and Hessle since 1997, had seemingly ruled himself out again, saying it is a ""10-year job"" and he does not have the ""right qualities"". Former army officer Dan Jarvis was elected MP for Barnsley Central in a by-election in 2011, having resigned his commission as a major in the Parachute Regiment to contest the seat.He held onto his seat at the general election, taking time out from campaigning to run the London Marathon last month.After entering Parliament in 2010, he quickly became a shadow culture, media and sport minister and later a shadow justice minister.In 2011, Mr Jarvis became the first serving politician in more than 60 years to be awarded a military honour, when he was made an MBE for his services to the armed forces.He has been touted by some colleagues as a future Labour leader but Mr Jarvis, who was widowed in 2010 and has a young family, ruled himself out, saying it is not the ""right time"" for him and his family. Historian and journalist Tristram Hunt entered Parliament in 2010 as Labour MP for Stoke-on-Trent Central.Ed Miliband made him shadow education secretary in 2013 and he has been a fierce critic of the coalition's education policies in England.Speaking in the aftermath of the election results, he called on Labour's ruling National Executive Committee ""not to rush our election"", saying there was time for a ""brutal post-mortem"" about Labour's ""underlying philosophy and thinking"".As for his own ambitions, he said ""it's about the lyrics as much as the lead singer I think"".He later said he was not confident of getting enough nominations to stand, and would support Liz Kendall.The MP for Rochdale says the deputy leader vacancy has ""come a bit too soon"" for him.He previously said a number of colleagues had asked him to put his name forward for the role.Mr Danczuk is well known for his prominent campaigning against child sex abuse and leading calls for an inquiry into allegations of historical child sex abuse by senior figures at Westminster.He was a vocal critic of Ed Miliband and in an article for the Daily Telegraph on Thursday he said Labour needed to ""step out if its Metropolitan comfort zone"" and ""reach out to the country once more.""The former director of public prosecutions has only just become an MP after being elected in Frank Dobson's old seat of Holborn and St Pancras, in North London at the general election.He was forced to rule himself out of the race to be Labour leader following a social media campaign urging him to stand.He said he was ""flattered"" by the campaign but the party needed someone with ""more political experience"".The older brother of ex-leader Ed, David Miliband was frontrunner to replace Gordon Brown in 2010, until his sibling beat him by a whisker.A former foreign secretary and MP for South Shields, he was the Blairite choice for leader but eventually quit Parliament to become head of the International Rescue Committee charity in New York in 2013.Speaking to the BBC from the US on the Monday after the general election, Mr Miliband criticised his brother's campaign in the 2015 general election, saying he and Mr Brown had ""allowed themselves to be portrayed as moving backwards from the principles of aspiration and inclusion that are the absolute heart of any successful progressive political project"".While he acknowledged the two men were ""brothers for life"", he also confirmed he was not eligible to stand for the party leadership as he is not an MP.Labour's election rulesMPs wishing to stand as leader and deputy leader have to be nominated by 15% of their colleagues in the Parliamentary Labour Party to be eligible to stand.As Labour now has 232 MPs, this means prospective candidates must get at least 34 signatures. That means the maximum size of any field is six contenders.Under rules agreed last year, all Labour Party members, registered supporters and affiliated supporters - including union members - will be allowed a maximum of one vote each on a one member, one vote system. When the election is held, they will be asked to rank candidates in order of preference.If no candidate gets 50% of all votes cast, the votes will be added up and the candidate with the fewest votes eliminated. Their 2nd preference votes will then be redistributed until one candidate has 50% of all votes cast."

2015-05-27,Round-up: BBC experts' analysis,https://web.archive.org//web/20150528020736/http://www.bbc.com/news/election-2015-32650417,"The political future of the United Kingdom has become clearer after the results of the general election emerged around the country.David Cameron says he hopes to govern for all of the UK after the Conservatives took 331 seats - enough to form a slender majority in the Commons.Labour has been all but wiped out by the SNP in Scotland and suffered a disappointing set of results elsewhere, while the Lib Dems are left with just eight MPs after many party heavyweights such as Vince Cable and Danny Alexander lost their seats.So with battles won and lost and the fall-out and celebrations beginning, BBC correspondents examine the implications and challenges that lie ahead for the new government - and for those whose political careers have been ended by voters.No pollster, no pundit, no political leader saw it coming - not even David Cameron himself.Governing parties don't gain seats. Parties that have implemented painful cuts and are promising more certainly don't. Until that is the Conservative Party did - achieving what had seemed to be Mission Impossible - a Tory majority.Until that is David Cameron's personal triumph which triggered the near simultaneous resignation of his three principle opponents - Messrs Miliband, Clegg and Farage.They did so in part because they helped to crush their partners in coalition these last five years - reducing the Liberal Democrat parliamentary party to a size when it can fit into two London taxis and still have two seats to spare.In part because the extraordinary tidal wave of support for the SNP swept dozens of once safe Labour seats away.In part because Nigel Farage persuaded millions to vote for him but secured just one seat - not, though, the one he was standing in.Read more from Nick Robinson hereThe question uppermost in the prime minister's mind as he assembles his new government is how to keep the kingdom united.""Above all I want to bring our country together,"" he revealed after the result, ""to reclaim a mantle we should never have lost - the mantle of one nation, one United Kingdom"".Looking at the political landscape from Land's End today is very different to the view from John O'Groats.A sea of Conservative and Unionist blue dominates the scene across much of England, while a field of SNP nationalist yellow stretches to the horizon and beyond from the north.David Cameron's greatest challenge is to prevent the union he supports being torn apart by mutual resentment - resentment from Scotland at a Westminster government dominated by English Tories, and resentment from England at the preferential treatment people think is being given to the Scots.Those who assumed the future of the Union had been safeguarded by the Scottish referendum must think again.Read more from Mark Easton hereOne thing is rock-solid true: the Conservatives who worked on this campaign are as surprised by the result as the pollsters, pundits, politicians and general population.Maybe they shouldn't be - the economy is in good shape and the Conservatives had incumbency advantage.But when I travelled back from the prime minister's last rally with a group of exhausted Conservative campaign officials it was clear that 290 seats was a hoped-for target.No-one talked about anything over 300 seats, and no-one even mentioned an overall majority.So what special sauce pushed David Cameron into No 10 with a Commons majority?Mr Cameron had two simple messages in the campaign and he rarely veered away from them; the first - the economy is in good shape and the recovery is threatened by Labour. And the second - the SNP would hold a Labour-led government to ransom.Read more from Jonny Dymond hereBrian Taylor, BBC political editor, ScotlandOf all the comments on the overnight apocalypse, undoubtedly the most straightforward came from a defeated Scottish Labour MP.Since there were quite a few of them, let me narrow the focus a little. Come on down, Tom Harris.Mr Harris had plainly anticipated defeat. Nonetheless, he looked suitably lugubrious as his fate was confirmed.Why, he was asked eagerly, had Labour lost? ""Because we did not win enough votes.""Psephologically, it is perfect. Complete in itself. Psychologically, it sums up Labour's gloom without descending into subsidiary matters such as leadership, strategy and the rest. As a forward-thinking strategy, it is ideal. Win more votes. Simple.Read more from Brian Taylor hereThis has been an election which may have more profound consequences than almost any in living memory.We now face a generational decision about our future in Europe, with an EU referendum in two years' time almost certain.There will also be serious questions about the future of the Union, following an SNP landslide that has turned Scotland into a virtual one-party state.David Cameron's victory also represents a colossal achievement.Only once before in recent history has an incumbent government increased its majority - and that was Mrs Thatcher in her prime in the 1980s.It is also a significant personal victory for Mr Cameron and a rebuff for those in his party who had become increasingly sceptical about his ability to win.But while it may represent a defeat for those Tories who saw this election as a potential opportunity to rid themselves of David Cameron, he must now govern with a wafer-thin majority.For the SNP, their stunning victory can only increase the pressure on Nicola Sturgeon to include a commitment to a second independence referendum in her party's manifesto for next year's Scottish elections.It is an election which has not just defied all the predictions of the pollsters and pundits - but which may yet prompt the most fundamental re-casting of British politics for a generation.Read more from Norman Smith hereAfter an extraordinary night, some brief conclusions:Read more from James Landale hereIs this the end of the union?That is the question many people will be asking this morning after the party which has fought for Scottish independence for 80 years swept to victory.The answer from the jubilant Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon is a firm ""No"".She insists that her MPs will speak for all of Scotland, not just for the 45% who voted for the country to leave the United Kingdom last September.In the closing hours of the most extraordinary election campaign which anyone in Scotland can remember, Ms Sturgeon turned to talk of ""legitimacy.""That will be her watchword in the coming days as she argues that the prime minister cannot ignore the democratic will of the Scottish people.Politically, Scotland and England this morning look and feel like very different countries.Read more from James Cook hereAfter weeks of chatter about an election too close to call, it wasn't that close at all.David Cameron will be continuing as our prime minister.So, what is all this likely to mean?A referendum on whether the UK stays in, or leaves, the European Union, within the next two-and-a-half years.A race to be the next leader of the Labour Party.A race to be the next leader of the Liberal Democrats.And a huge new presence of Scottish National Party MPs at Westminster.And so here's another thing we know for certain this morning: Politics ain't going to be boring any time soon.Read more from Chris Mason hereFor Labour the story of their terrible night is rapidly turning into the search for a new leader. So who will that be?Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, is almost certain to run.  Even before this election, both he and another almost inevitable candidate, Chuka Umunna, had raised eyebrows inside the party at the work they had put in, preparing the ground with members and the unions for potential bids.Yvette Cooper, before the election, was still thought not to have made up her mind over whether to run. That decision has been made perhaps a little easier as her husband, Ed Balls, has lost his seat.She is certainly potentially in the frame, along with two lesser known names - Liz Kendall and Dan Jarvis - two MPs who were only elected in 2010 for the first time. This could be their moment. But whoever is in the job, they face a monumental task.Read Laura Kuenssberg's Twitter hereSterling is up (the most for seven years against the euro), share prices are up (especially bank shares like Lloyds and RBS, and energy shares such as Centrica), government bond prices are up.To state the obvious, investors love the Tories' general election victory.There are a few reasons.One (no surprise here) is that Labour's threat of breaking up banks and imposing energy price caps has been lifted.Second is that investors have been discounting days and weeks of wrangling after polling day over who would form the government - and so they are semi-euphoric that we already know who's in charge.Third, many investors tend to be economically conservative and instinctively Conservative.But although the City may be a bit drunk on the result, its pleasure in Ed Miliband's and Ed Balls' humiliation may be making it a bit blind - perhaps dangerously so - to some bumps in the economic road ahead.Read more from Robert Peston hereNigel Farage dreamed of holding the balance of power, but in the end his UKIP party is now worse off than when it came into the election.At the seventh time of asking he was rejected - this time by the people of Thanet South. It was a similar story in Rochester and Strood where Mark Reckless, who sensationally defected from the Tories last year, was also sent packing.In seats on UKIP's target list, like Thurrock in Essex, the party failed to make gains. In Grimsby - where Mr Farage went twice in the last six weeks - they came third.UKIP got around four million votes - with especially strong showings in north-east and south-east England - but it's ended up with just one MP, and a vacancy at the top. This has led to UKIP attacking the current system of choosing MPs, which it's described as ""busted"" and ""dysfunctional"".In one sense, this campaign was a complete failure and it's left an aftermath of angry voters, and others wondering if the UKIP bubble has burst.Read Robin Brant's Twitter hereI monitored 91 GB-wide voting intention polls during the 2015 election campaign and found nothing in them to prepare me for the final outcome.The good news for the pollsters was that their share for the Lib Dems was pretty close, as were the shares for UKIP, the Greens and the catch-all category of Others.The bad news for the polling industry was that the crucial shares for Conservative and Labour were the ones where they came most adrift.When all the qualifications of margins of error are allowed, there did appear to be a systematic overstatement of the Labour share and an equally systematic understatement of the Conservative one.It is for the pollsters to decide whether to conduct a review of their performance but I trust they will avoid the initial knee-jerk reaction of the immediate aftermath of the 1992 polls debacle.This general election performance follows the performance of the polls in the 2014 Scottish referendum where the choice was simply binary and yet all the polls were out by between 4-6%.Something is wrong. A lot of us would like to know what it is.Read more from David Cowling hereThe words ""political earthquake"" have been translated into numerous European languages, making front page news across the continent.While Britons now examine the domestic minutiae of the election result, here in mainland Europe the vote means one thing: a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU. And that has the potential to create an earthquake of its own.The guardian of the EU treaties Mr Cameron wants to change - Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker - has said again he'd listen to what Britain's new government proposed.Read more from Katya Adler here"

2015-05-27,"EU referendum: What, when and why?",https://web.archive.org//web/20150528020736/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"The UK is set to have a referendum by the end of 2017 on whether or not to remain a member of the European Union.The Conservatives' election manifesto promised to hold a referendum (a nationwide vote) on whether or not the UK should stay in or leave the European Union. They won the election so it's all systems go.A referendum is basically a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part, normally giving a ""Yes"" or ""No"" answer to a question. Whichever side gets more than half of all votes cast is considered to have won.The European Union is an economic and political partnership between 28 European countries. It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, its own parliament and it now sets the rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things like mobile phone charges.The one thing we know for sure is that Prime Minister David Cameron has said it will happen by the end of 2017. The most likely times of the year for referendums are generally May or September, and some people think it should be held as soon as possible - possibly even in May 2016, to coincide with elections in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and London, rather than waiting for 2017. When David Cameron announced in January 2013 his pledge to hold a referendum, a key element was that he would seek to make changes to the way the European Union works - or at least the rules covering the UK as a European Union member. Only once this renegotiation of British membership had been completed would he put the new arrangement to the public vote.During the election the Lib Dems and Labour both said they did not want a referendum unless there were plans to transfer more powers from the UK to the EU. Labour has since dropped its opposition, so the Conservatives are expected to get their Referendum Bill passed easily. The House of Lords could delay it, but as the referendum was promised in the Conservative election manifesto (a manifesto is a document setting out what a party would do if they won the election) it is not likely to reject the bill once MPs back it.The question is always crucial in any referendum and there is already debate about what it should be. The 2013 suggestion from the Conservatives was: ""Do you think that the United Kingdom should remain a member of the European Union?"" Some people thought this phrasing leaned too far towards the status quo - the current state of affairs - and the Electoral Commission, which has to approve the question, said it was not clear enough and proposed:""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union?""Read more: Does the wording of a referendum question matter?British, Irish and Commonwealth citizens over 18 who are resident in the UK, along with UK nationals who have lived overseas for less than 15 years. Members of the House of Lords and Commonwealth citizens in Gibraltar will also be eligible, unlike in a general election. Citizens from EU countries - apart from Ireland, Malta and Cyprus - will not get a vote.Mr Cameron is not revealing the full details of what he wants from the other EU leaders ahead of negotiations - but he is expected to demand an opt-out from one of its core principles of forging an ""ever-closer union"" between member states. He will also try to get restrictions on welfare benefits - in particular, tax credits - for migrants and more powers to block or opt out of new EU laws.Read more: Q&A: What Britain wants from EuropeBritain had a referendum in 1975 shortly after it had joined the EU, or the Common Market as it was then called. The country voted to stay in then but there have been growing calls, from the public and politicians, for another vote because, they argue, the EU has changed a lot over the past 40 years, with many more countries joining and the organisation extending its control over more aspects of daily lives. David Cameron initially resisted these calls but in 2013 he changed his mind.About 33% of the British public, according to the latest opinion polls. The UK Independence Party, which won the last European elections, and received nearly four million votes, 13% of those cast, in May's general election, campaigns for Britain's exit from the EU. A fair number of Conservative MPs - and several Labour ones - are also thought to be strongly in favour of leaving.They believe Britain is being held back by the EU, which they say imposes too many rules on business and charges billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also want Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. They also object to the idea of ""ever closer union"" and the belief that the ultimate goal is to create a ""United States of Europe"".David Cameron wants Britain to stay in the EU, once he has got some powers back from it. He has so far refused to say whether he would start calling for Britain to leave if he does not get what he wants from the other EU leaders. The Labour Party, SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems are also in favour of staying in. Latest opinion polls suggest 45% of the British public agree with them.They believe Britain gets a big boost from EU membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argue, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also believe Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving.It depends which way you look at it - or what you believe is important. Leaving the EU would be a big step - arguably far more important than who wins the next general election - but would it set the nation free or condemn it to economic ruin? Here is a rundown of the arguments for and against.Big business - with a few exceptions - tends to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. The CBI president and BT chief Sir Mike Rake says there are ""no credible alternatives"" to staying in the EU. But others disagree, such as Lord Bamford, chairman of JCB, who says an EU exit would allow the UK to negotiate trade deals as our country ""rather than being one of 28 nations"". Many small- and medium-sized firms would welcome a cut in red tape and what they see as petty regulations, but a lot hangs on what deal Mr Cameron renegotiates. The British Chambers of Commerce says 55% of members back staying in a reformed EU.Find out more: Business for Britain wants big changes to the UK's relations with the EU and says the UK should be prepared to vote to leave if the changes are not achievedBusiness for New Europe is a coalition of business leaders who support the UK's membership of the EU and ""oppose withdrawal to the margins"".The Electoral Commission will be in charge of making sure it's a fair contest.  There will be official ""Yes"" and ""No"" campaigns, selected by the Commission, which will have to abide by strict spending limits. Anyone wanting to launch their own Yes or No campaign will have to register with the Commission if they plan to spend more than £10,000. They must be UK-based. The Commission says MPs should decide what kinds of organisations should be allowed to take part. Business groups, trade unions and pressure groups are all likely to want to have their say.There will also be rules to prevent organisations trying to get round the spending limits through multiple registrations. Political parties will also be allowed to campaign for the result they want to see.Anyone who runs an unregistered campaign will be limited to spending less than £10,000. The idea is to prevent wealthy foreigners, companies or governments trying to influence the outcome. The Electoral Commission has published preliminary guidelines.That is yet to be decided and will partly depend on what Mr Cameron achieves in his renegotiation of the terms of the UK's membership of the EU. He says he is confident he can get what he wants, in which case he would be expected to lead the ""staying in"" side. The highest profile supporter of leaving the EU is UKIP leader Nigel Farage, but there are likely to be other high profile politicians who support withdrawal - or, as with the anti-euro campaign a few years back, celebrities or business people could front an ""anti-politics"" campaign.Conservatives' election manifesto - including referendum pledgeTry these features:How to win a referendumWhat David Cameron wants from the EU negotiationsTimeline: Campaigns for a European Union referendumBusinesses give their views on a possible EU exit"

The PM, who will be hoping his majority government will give him extra leverage in Brussels, wants to renegotiate the terms of the UK's membership ahead of a referendum by the end of 2017. He has said he will campaign for Britain to remain in the EU if he gets the reforms he wants.Mr Cameron has said he does not want to reveal full details of his negotiating hand but he has given a broad indication, in a series of speeches and newspaper articles, of his priorities when he goes into talks with other EU leaders.These are: The prime minister has said Britain would resist any move towards a European Army and that he wants to free British police forces from EU interference. He has also ruled out Britain joining the euro.But he has placed less emphasis in recent years on demanding changes to EU social policy, such as the maximum 48-hour working week, agency workers, maternity leave and non-discrimination rules.The official UK government position is that a referendum will be held by the end of 2017 but Downing Street sources have said: ""If we can do it earlier we will.""There is speculation David Cameron is planning to hold the vote in 2016 to avoid a clash with French and German elections in 2017.The prime minister wants treaty change but even if the referendum was held in 2017 there may not be enough time to legally incorporate any reforms into a treaty and it would have to be done at a later stage.An early referendum would anger Eurosceptics who believe it would not allow enough time to make the case for exit or negotiate any meaningful concessions.""A rushed process would severely undermine the chances to secure a significant deal that both British business and voters could support and would waste the opportunity of a lifetime,"" Matthew Elliott, chief executive of Business for Britain told Breitbart London.The question is always crucial in any referendum and there is already a debate about what it should be. The Draft European Union (Referendum) Bill, published by the Conservatives in 2013, proposed this form of words: ""Do you think that the United Kingdom should remain a member of the European Union?""Some thought that leaned too far towards the status quo, encouraging a yes vote, and the Electoral Commission said it was not clear and direct enough. The watchdog proposed this form of words instead: ""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union?""The new Conservative government will attempt to repeal the Human Rights Act, which requires UK courts to treat the European Court of Human Rights as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. The European Court of Human Rights is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe (CoE), which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine.The freedom for people to move around Europe, enshrined in the EU treaties, works in parallel with the other three basic freedoms in the single market: freedom of goods, capital and services.It is likely to be a ""red line"" for other EU leaders, who do not want to see it eroded.Mr Cameron has steered clear of tackling it directly - for example by asking for an emergency ""brake"" on free movement, or a cap on numbers - focusing instead on reducing the incentive provided by welfare payments. In a speech last November, David Cameron set out measures to reduce the number of EU nationals moving to the UK.His main proposals were:Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission, has said he is ready to work with Mr Cameron to ""strike a fair deal for the United Kingdom in the EU"". The leaders of other EU nations have previously warned they are unlikely to support major changes to EU treaties to accommodate British demands. But Mr Cameron's general election victory may have given him extra leverage. ""The ball is very much in the court of the UK now,"" a senior EU official told The Guardian. ""It's up to the British to define what they want."" The key figure will be German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is very keen to keep Britain in the EU but has so far been unwilling to make major concessions to enable that to happen. There are fears that a ""pick and mix"" approach to EU treaties would undermine EU cohesion.Mr Cameron has said there is ""no doubt"" his planned reforms will require changes to the treaties governing the European Union. But this would require the unanimous support of all EU members, and may not be possible within the deadline he has set of a referendum before the end of 2017. Any attempt to change EU laws on free movement would meet fierce resistance from some EU nations, particularly Eastern European states. Mr Juncker has said free movement is non-negotiable.Mr Cameron may find it difficult to get unanimous support for his proposals for a four-year waiting period for migrant workers claiming UK benefits. East European EU members would be likely to oppose this, on the grounds that it would discriminate against their citizens.  Attempts to secure opt-outs for the City are unlikely to go down well with other European leaders.However, there are precedents for EU treaty changes to accommodate some countries' specific concerns - for example, the protocol attached to the Lisbon Treaty for Ireland.Mr Cameron has faced repeated calls to say whether he would campaign for Britain's exit from the EU in the referendum if he fails to get what he wants from the renegotiation process. All he has said is that he will ""rule nothing out"". Some Conservative MPs want Britain to leave the EU no matter what David Cameron manages to renegotiate. A larger group are likely to want more concessions than Mr Cameron has so far indicated he is prepared to demand.Senior backbencher David Davis, who was defeated by Mr Cameron for the Tory leadership in 2005, told the Daily Telegraph the majority of the 332 Conservative MPs want Mr Cameron to negotiate an ""opt-out"" power to stop individual EU laws from applying to Britain. The prime minister has said this would be ""impossible"" without Britain leaving the EU.Mr Davis claims as many as 60 Tory MPs would be prepared to rebel and vote for Britain's exit from the EU if the prime minister fails to deliver.Graham Brady, chairman of the Tory backbench 1922 committee, which represents backbenchers, has urged David Cameron to give all Conservative MPs, including ministers, a free vote in the EU referendum.In January, Mr Cameron warned that serving cabinet ministers would have to quit the government if they wanted to campaign to leave the EU if he had secured the reforms to it he wants.In the 1975 referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Economic Community, as the EU was then called, Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson decided to suspend collective responsibility because his cabinet was split on the issue. Ministers were allowed to vote with their consciences and campaign against each other. The majority of them, including Mr Wilson, joined the Yes camp, but left-wingers, such as Tony Benn, played a leading role in the No campaign. The Yes campaign won easily with 67% of the vote."
2015-05-27,UK and the EU: Better off out or in?,https://web.archive.org//web/20150528020736/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32793642,"David Cameron has promised a referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Union by the end of 2017. Here is a summary of the key arguments for and against British membership.If Britain votes to leave the EU, it will have to negotiate a new trading relationship with what would now be a 27 member organisation, to allow British firms to sell goods and services to EU countries without being hit by excessive tariffs and other restrictions.Better off out: Britain could negotiate an ""amicable divorce"", but retain strong trading links with EU nations, say those campaigning for Britain's exit. There are several potential scenarios:Better off in: An ""amicable divorce"" is a pipe dream, pro-EU campaigners argue. France, Germany and other leading EU nations would never allow Britain a ""pick and mix"" approach to the bloc's rules. Norway and Switzerland have to abide by many EU rules without any influence over how they are formed. Negotiating a comprehensive free trade agreement could take years and have an uncertain outcome. And if Britain went for a completely clean break with the EU its exports would be subject to tariffs and would still have to meet EU production standards, harming the competitiveness of British business.The run-up to the EU referendum is likely to be dominated by competing claims about how many millions of jobs will be lost or gained by Britain's exit. All such claims come with a health warning. Coming up with a precise figure is difficult as there is no way of knowing if threats by foreign companies to scale back their operations in the UK would come to pass or, indeed, how many jobs would be created by the reshaped economy that might emerge in the wake of an exit.Better off out: There would be a jobs boom as firms are freed from EU regulations and red tape, say those arguing for an exit, with small- and medium-sized companies who don't trade with the EU benefiting the most. In its recent paper, the EU Jobs Myth, the free market Institute for Economic Affairs seeks to debunk the claim that 3-4 million jobs would be lost if Britain left. ""Jobs are associated with trade, not membership of a political union, and there is little evidence to suggest that trade would substantially fall between British businesses and European consumers in the event the UK was outside the EU,"" it argues. ""The UK labour market is incredibly dynamic, and would adapt quickly to changed relationships with the EU.""Better off in: Millions of jobs would be lost as global manufacturers moved to lower-cost EU countries. Britain's large, foreign-owned car industry would be particularly at risk. ""The attractiveness of the UK as a place to invest and do automotive business is clearly underpinned by the UK's influential membership of the EU,"" said a KPMG report on the car industry last year. The financial services sector, which employs about 2.1 million people in the UK, also has concerns about a British exit. ""The success of the UK financial services industry is to a large extent built on EU Internal Market legislation. To abandon this for some untried, unknown and unpredictable alternative would carry very significant risks,"" said global law firm Clifford Chance in a report by think tank TheCityUK last year.Much would depend on the trade deals Britain managed to negotiate with the EU and rest of the world after its exit. The best-case scenario, according to think tank Open Europe, is that the UK would be better off by 1.6% of GDP a year by 2030. That is assuming the UK carried out widespread deregulation after its exit and managed to strike favourable trade deals. The think tank adds: ""A far more realistic range is between a 0.8% permanent loss to GDP in 2030 and a 0.6% permanent gain in GDP in 2030, in scenarios where Britain mixes policy approaches"".The Centre for Economic Performance, at the London School of Economics, says the worst-case scenario is a 6.3% to 9.5% reduction in GDP, ""a loss of a similar size to that resulting from the global financial crisis of 2008/09"". The best case, according to their analysis, is a loss of 2.2% of GDP.Better off out: Britain would regain full control of its borders. UKIP wants to see a work permit system introduced, so that EU nationals would face the same visa restrictions as those from outside the EU, which it says would reduce population growth from current levels of 298,000 a year to about 50,000. This would create job opportunities for British workers and boost wages, as well as easing pressure on schools, hospitals and other public services. Better off in: Britain might have to agree to allow free movement of EU migrants as the price of being allowed access to the free market. In any case, immigration from the rest of the EU has been good for Britain's economy. The UK's growth forecasts are based, in part, on continued high levels of net migration. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility says the economy relies on migrant labour and taxes paid by immigrants to keep funding public services.The UK's net contribution to the EU, taking into account the rebate, was £11.3bn in 2013. That is more than four times what it was in 2008. It is about the same amount as the UK government spends on transport every year.Better off out: The UK would save billions in membership fees, and end the ""hidden tariff"" paid by UK taxpayers when goods are exported to the EU, caused by red tape, waste, fraud and other factors. Better off in: The UK's contribution to the EU budget is a drop in the ocean compared with the benefits to business of being in the single market. Better off out: The EU is not as important to British trade as it used to be, and continuing turmoil in the eurozone will make it even less so. Even if Britain did not manage to negotiate a free trade deal with the EU it would not be as disastrous as EU-enthusiasts claim, argues economist Roger Bootle in his book The Trouble with Europe: ""It would place the UK in the same position as the US is currently in, along with India, China and Japan, all of which manage to export to the EU relatively easily."" The UK would be free to establish bilateral trade agreements with fast-growing export markets such as China, Singapore, Brazil, Russia and India through the World Trade Organisation. Better off in: The EU is the UK's main trading partner, worth more than £400bn a year, or 52% of the total trade in goods and services. Complete withdrawal from the EU would see trade barriers erected, with car exports to the EU, for example, facing a 15% tariff and imports a tariff of 10%.  ""The idea that the UK would be freer outside the EU is based on a series of misconceptions, that a medium-sized, open economy could hold sway in an increasingly fractured trading system dominated by the US, the EU and China; that the EU makes it harder for Britain to penetrate emerging markets; and that foreign capital would be more attracted to Britain's economy if it were no longer part of the single market,"" the pro-EU Centre for European Reform said in a recent report.Better off out: The UK would remain a key part of Nato and the UN Security Council and a nuclear power, with a powerful global voice in its own right. The Eurosceptic Bruges Group wants an end to the ""discredited"" principle that Britain acts as a transatlantic bridge between the US and Europe, saying the country should make self-reliance its guiding principle.Better off in: Stripped of influence in Brussels, Berlin and Paris, Britain would find itself increasingly ignored by Washington and sidelined on big transnational issues such as the environment, security and trade. America and other allies want Britain to remain in the EU. The UK risks becoming a maverick, isolated state if it leaves.Better off out: Britain would gain full control of its own borders, with migration in and out of the country regulated solely by British law. It would be more difficult for EU citizens to move to the UK, although those already living here are unlikely to be removed. Better off in: A lot would depend on what kind of deal was reached with the other EU nations. Britons may have to apply for visas to enter EU countries and those already living there may face integration rules, such as proving they can speak the language before gaining long-term residency rights. There would also be uncertainty for many EU workers now paying taxes in the UK - what benefits, if any, would they be entitled to?Better off out: The EU has limited power over tax, which is largely a matter for national governments. The exception is VAT, which has bands agreed at the EU level. Outside the EU, the UK would potentially have more flexibility.Better off in:  ""Tax avoidance and evasion will reach crippling levels as our economy becomes increasingly wholly owned by foreign multinationals that make tax avoidance in Britain central to their business strategy,"" argued the pro-European The Observer newspaper in an editorial.Better off out: It would be a major shot in the arm for British democracy as the Westminster parliament regained its sovereignty and reconnected with voters. The country would be free from the European Arrest Warrant and other law and order measures.Better off in: Britons benefit from EU employment laws and social protections, which would be stripped away. Withdrawal from the European Arrest Warrant could mean delays for the UK in extraditing suspects from other European countries; and the UK already has some opt-outs from EU labour law, including the Working Time Directive."
2015-05-27,Analysis,https://web.archive.org//web/20150528020736/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32896924,"This was the speech David Cameron fully expected the monarch to make. But under different circumstances.While he always thought a Conservative majority was possible, the pre-election polls pointed to a minority government.If that happened, today would have been a moment of high drama - would the combined forces of Labour and the SNP vote down the Queen's Speech? Would measures have to be withdrawn or would a new, Labour-led minority administration take over?Well, in the end, the voters and not the politicians delivered their verdict and while his working majority is small, just a few weeks ago when David Cameron said the polls had caused him stomach ulcers, he would have settled for this outcome.He is in the driving seat, and has had to park relatively few of his plans.Journalists have been deprived of the tension of a tight vote and the spectacle of a government teetering on the brink -  but that doesn't mean the first Queen's Speech by a Conservative government in nearly two decades was a damp squib.There were bills which immediately highlighted their freedom from Lib Dem shackles.Measures on welfare reform almost certainly wouldn't have been proposed in this form had there been a second coalition.The main rates of working-age benefits - including tax credits and child benefit - are to be frozen until 2017, the benefit cap is to be lowered, and entitlement to housing support for young adults is to be withdrawn.If the Lib Dems had signed up to this, they would have insisted on the withdrawal of some benefits from wealthy pensioners too and pushed for their ""mansions tax"" on high value properties -  but those measures are absent from the Queen's Speech. Similarly, further legislation to limit strike action would have been absent if Vince Cable had still been at the Business Department. But having swept aside their former coalition partners, politically the Conservatives are focussed on consolidating any ground taken from Labour.So their welfare reforms are encased in a bill entitled 'Full Employment and Welfare Benefits' - with a commitment to monitoring progress towards achieving full employment and providing more apprenticeships.The political message is clear - that the government will help ""working people"" but not those claiming benefits who, in the words if the prime minister, are ""sitting at home"". The Conservatives' own polling highlighted that this was a powerful message especially in the Midlands and southern marginals seized from, or defended from, Labour.The intention is to try to recreate the coalition, not with the Lib Dems, but with people who don't traditionally back the Conservatives, but whose parents may well have voted for Mrs Thatcher before deserting the party for Tony Blair.The prime minister is even using the language of 'One Nation' - briefly favoured by Ed Miliband.So there are measures to extend free child care, and the right to buy to housing association tenants, and to ensure those who work thirty hours a week for the minimum wage won't pay income tax.But it's also interesting to note what isn't in the Queen's Speech.Labour warned that VAT would have to rise. There will now be a bill to freeze the rate until the end of the parliament. There were warnings from the opposition, too, that child benefit might be cut further, or limited to the first two children. There is no mention of this. But some of the detail of the welfare cuts may not become apparent until the Chancellor delivers a fully Conservative Budget in just over a month's time.But in some areas, the drama is merely postponed, not defused.The government ensured that the Queen didn't just make mention of the referendum bill that might have kept some seats secure from UKIP - but that there would be ""early legislation"". So straight away the government are seen to deliver on an election promise - but the prime minister is also giving himself the option of holding the vote earlier than his deadline of the end of 2017.He has united the Conservatives in calling a referendum, but whenever it takes place, the divisions in his own party will become apparent. Inevitably some of his own MPs will denounce what has been re-negotiated as inadequate and call for a No vote.And the wafer-thin nature of David Cameron's majority has already become apparent. The manifesto commitment to scrap the Human Rights Act in favour of a new British Bill of Rights did rate a mention in the Queen's Speech.But while in most areas the monarch talked about ""legislation"" or ""measures"" being introduced, on the British Bill of Rights she merely mentioned 'proposals.' So further consultation is likely.The former frontbencher David Davis has taken this is a signal that the measure will be sidelined and said that it was right to ""listen about the folly of abolishing the human rights act in the 800th year of Magna Carta"".Already it would appear that a box marked ""difficult"" is on the PM's Downing Street desk, and this has been pushed inside.And there is likely to be trouble ahead, too, in passing the forthcoming Scotland Bill which the government wants on the statute books before the Holyrood elections in a year's time.Never before have so many SNP MPs occupied the green benches at Westminster and they intend to make their presence felt. So while the Queen read out the government's commitment to ""devolving wide ranging powers to Scotland"" and to work with devolved administrations ""on the basis of mutual respect"", the Scottish Nationalists will push for more  - and argue that English-based MPs should not determine the scope of the Scottish Parliament's remit.The government will also press ahead with plans to deliver English votes for English laws through amending the standing orders of Parliament rather than, for example, through a symbolic ""England Bill"". Some of the prime minister's backbenchers are likely to feel that these measures won't go far enough.But while much of the next two years will involve arguments around the constitution - from EU membership to human rights to the powers of the Scottish parliament and Welsh and Northern Irish assemblies - make no mistake that there is a majority for much of what is in the Queen's Speech.If David Cameron maintains that majority for the next few years, Britain will be transformed in ways which are likely to be controversial. The size of the state will reduce. Working age benefits will be less generous. The deficit will be eliminated. And, if successful, the idea of a 'Northern Powerhouse' will help re-balance the economy away from the south-east.The last Labour leader had hoped he would be in a position to defeat David Cameron's Queen's Speech today. The interim leader Harriet Harman didn't engage in any small talk with the prime minister as she walked alongside him to the House of Lords to hear what the monarch had to say.But she will know the next Labour leader will have to decide how much of this agenda to accept and how much to oppose. But he or she will also have the challenge of creating distinctive policies to appeal to the ""working people"" the Conservatives have in their sights."
2015-05-27,Data law,https://web.archive.org//web/20150528020736/http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-32900604,"Overdue modernisation of the way the authorities monitor criminals and terrorists - or a Snooper's Charter eroding our basic liberties? The proposal outlined in the Queen's Speech to ""modernise the law on communications data"" will divide opinion. But prepare for another long battle over the way that law is framed and the balance it strikes between privacy and public safety.The row over forcing internet service providers (ISPs) to hold on to far more data about their users' online activities has stretched over three parliaments. The idea first came up under the last Labour government, when it was quashed by Conservative and Liberal Democrat opposition. Then it was resurrected by the Coalition, with Theresa May's plans - immediately dubbed the Snooper's Charter - blocked by her Liberal Democrat partners.Now we have in the Queen's Speech what looks like a much wider proposal for a new Investigatory Powers Bill. The government says this will ""provide the police and intelligence agencies with the tools to keep you and your family safe"", will ""maintain the ability of our intelligence agencies to target the online communications of terrorists"", and will ""cover all investigatory powers including communications data, where the government has long maintained that the gap in capabilities are putting lives at risk"".So it is both sweeping and vague, promising to give the authorities the tools they need to track criminals in a complex online world without specifying as yet how far they will be allowed to go.The Open Rights Group (ORG), which campaigns against increased surveillance, is convinced this is the return of the so-called Snooper's Charter, with increased powers of data collection and retention aimed at the entire population, coupled with attacks on encryption.The ORG's executive director Jim Killock thinks the bill will have two aims - codifying existing practices by the intelligence agencies uncovered by Edward Snowden and expanding data retention by ISPs. But he believes that the increasing use of encryption by the likes of Google and Facebook means that ordering ISPs to store their customers' data won't be enough: ""There's going to be a very interesting discussion about whether government can break encryption or order companies to break it.""Those at the sharp end - the ISPs - are more circumspect in their response to the government's plans. Their trade body ISPA put out a statement welcoming the fact that the government had promised to factor in the independent Anderson review of the laws on intercepting communications data. But it warned of the need to ""properly balance security, privacy, costs to industry and to preserve the UK's reputation as a leading place to do business online"".  The ISPs also suspect that plans to attack encryption could be on the agenda. The government has a clear election mandate, and is under pressure from the police and intelligence agencies to give them more capabilities in their online battles. But the opposition to its plans - if they do involve cracking the codes that keep online communication secret - will be intense. And it is likely to come not so much from opposition politicians, but from the global technology giants. "

He promised to create ""the strongest devolved government anywhere in the world with important powers over taxation"".These new powers for Scotland were outlined in the Queen's Speech.The Scotland Bill will be based on recommendations made by the Smith Commission - the cross-party group formed after the independence referendum to look at what additional powers might be handed to Scotland.If the legislation makes it over the usual parliamentary hurdles, new powers will include;In addition, the Scottish Parliament has already been given the power to extend voting to 16 and 17 year olds in time for the 2016 Scottish Parliamentary elections.The Scotland Bill will be based on draft legislation, or a ""command paper"", which was published by the previous Tory/Lib Dem coalition government in January. But a committee of MSPs at Holyrood, where the SNP is in government, said the powers plan ""fell short"" of recommendations made by Smith Commission.SNP leader and Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon had called for a new Scotland Bill that would go beyond Smith.She wants additional powers, including control of:None of these feature in the forthcoming Bill which is one of 21 proposed by the majority Conservative government.Nevertheless, the Scottish government will be seeking assurances that UK ministers cannot veto any of the powers already promised to Scotland in the draft legislation, such as changes to benefits.Full fiscal autonomy - the responsibility for all areas of tax and spending except defence and foreign affairs - remains a key goal for the SNP, but not yet.During an interview on the BBC's Andrew Marr, Ms Sturgeon said she would be pressing the Prime Minster to give Scotland greater financial control, but ""clearly that will take a number of years to implement"".Just two days before people in Scotland cast their votes in the Scottish independence referendum, the leaders of the three Unionist parties - David Cameron (Conservatives); Ed Miliband (Labour) and Nick Clegg (Liberal Democrats) - made a public ""vow"" to give Holyrood more powers.On 18 September 2014, the electorate voted 55% to 45% against independence and Mr Cameron promised the day after the referendum that if he won the 2015 General Election he would deliver the ""vow"".The general election saw the SNP win 56 of Scotland's 59 Westminster seats which prompted party leader Ms Sturgeon to pledge that her MPs would provide the loudest ever voice for Scots in the House of Commons.Following the election, Mr Cameron met with Ms Sturgeon who called their talks ""constructive and business like"".While the PM has said he would look at ""sensible suggestions"" for more powers, he has given no indication he would go beyond Smith.The new Scottish Secretary David Mundell has also said he believed the Smith proposals were the ""right package"" for the country.He too signalled the UK government would be prepared to listen to calls for more powers, but as part of usual parliamentary procedures.After the Scottish independence referendum, Mr Cameron made a speech outside No 10 Downing Street in which he said the UK needed, not only a new deal for Scotland, but for the ""millions of voices in England"" to be heard. So, what has happened since September last year?"
2015-05-27,First Queen's Speech,https://web.archive.org//web/20150528020736/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32815788,"All eyes will be on the Palace of Westminster on Wednesday as the Queen reads out the legislative plans of David Cameron's new government.It will be a chance for the first all-Conservative government for almost 20 years to set out its stall for the next five years. Here's how some other new governments have used their Queen's (and King's) speeches.The 1945 election marked a watershed in British history. The Conservative wartime leader, Sir Winston Churchill, was defeated by Clement Attlee's Labour Party.The state opening of Parliament, on 15 August 1945, came at the end of World War Two, on Victory in Japan Day.King George VI's speech was delivered in the House of Lords, which had been occupied by MPs since the Commons chamber was destroyed by bombs.""Echoes of great events in British history mingled with the rejoicings of victory when the House of Commons assembled this morning in St Stephen's Hall for the state opening of Parliament,"" the Times newspaper reported, noting that Churchill was cheered as he took his seat.""The continuing shortages in the supply of many necessaries, especially houses, food, clothing and fuel, will call for the same spirit of tolerance and understanding which the nation has displayed during the past six years of war.""Key services and industries were nationalised, and Attlee's government ushered in the welfare state and the National Health Service.  India was granted independence.The Attlee government changed the face of British society, creating a new social consensus that was to remain largely unchanged until 1979, but its majority was slashed in 1950 amid public frustration at continued austerity and rationing, and the following year saw Churchill return to power with a comfortable majority.Margaret Thatcher became the UK's first female prime minister, ousting Jim Callaghan's Labour with a 43-seat majority. During the campaign she had promised to cut taxes, reduce public spending and curb the power of trade unions.""My government intend to achieve a fair balance between the rights and duties of the trade union movement.""""Right to buy"" proved extremely popular, with about 1.5m homes purchased under the rules by 2003. It was seen as a major vote winner for the Conservatives in subsequent elections, and in 1985 Labour dropped its official opposition to the scheme.Critics said it contributed to a reduction in the number of available council homes.Meanwhile, Mrs Thatcher's battles with trade unions became one of the defining features of her premiership. Ultimately their power was reduced and membership plummeted.Many of the services nationalised under the Attlee government were privatised.Public spending was slashed, and documents released in 2009 revealed even some Conservative ministers were alarmed at the scale of cuts planned in 1979.Mrs Thatcher was prime minister until 1990, winning three general elections. The Conservatives won one further election and remained in power until 1997.On 1 May 1997, Labour's 18 years in opposition came to an end. Tony Blair's New Labour won a 179-seat majority - the biggest in its history - on a manifesto which not only promised no income tax rises, but also a pledge to stick to Conservative spending plans.""The central economic objectives of my government are high and stable levels of economic growth and employment, to be achieved by ensuring opportunity for all.""""These are only the first steps on a long journey,"" was the Guardian's verdict, adding that ""Labour begins that journey sustained by enormous national delight"".Business leaders broadly welcomed the decision to free the Bank of England, which had divided the Conservatives. The Bank's monetary policy committee continues to set interest rates.Labour got into hot water with its tobacco advertising ban, as it announced an exemption for Formula One and then had to return a £1 million donation from F1 chief Bernie Ecclestone.The Freedom of Information Act remains in place - although Mr Blair subsequently described it as one the biggest regrets of his time in office. The Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly were established after referendums.Labour went on to win two more general elections, with the 2010 election bringing an end to its 13-year tenure.After the general election left no single party in overall control of Parliament, the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats came together to form Britain's first coalition government in 70 years. The result was the coalition agreement, which would form the backbone of the government's legislative programme for the next five years.""Action will be taken to accelerate the reduction of the structural budget deficit.""Contrary to some predictions, the two parties remained together throughout the parliament.Civil liberties measures like scrapping ID cards proved more straightforward than issues where the two parties were on opposite sides of the debate, like the proposed move to the Alternative Vote system, which was resoundingly rejected in a referendum.The government went on to change the structure of the NHS - despite vocal opposition from Labour - and set out details of the HS2 rail line, with construction due to start in 2017.After sticking together for five years, the two parties experienced differing fortunes at the 2015 election - the Conservatives secured an unexpected majority while the Lib Dems lost all but eight of their MPs."
2015-05-27,The Queen's Speech,https://web.archive.org//web/20150528020736/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32816450,"The Queen's Speech is the centrepiece of the State Opening of Parliament, which takes place this year on 27 May. It is one of the highlights of the parliamentary year, full of both pageantry and political significance.What is the Queen's Speech?In a nutshell, it is a list of the laws that the government hopes to get approved by Parliament over the coming year. By convention, it is announced by the Sovereign in the presence of MPs, peers and other dignitaries in the House of Lords.The occasion marks the start of the Parliamentary year and has added resonance after a change of government, with the contents of the Speech highlighting the priorities of new ministers and setting the scene for parliamentary battle ahead.Has there always been a Queen's Speech?Traditions surrounding the State Opening of Parliament and the delivery of a speech by the monarch can be traced back as far as the 16th Century. The current ceremony dates from 1852, when the Palace of Westminster was re-opened after the fire of 1834. There is normally one Queen's Speech every year, although the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition government decided against having one in 2011, arguing that its legislative programme was so extensive that it would require two years to implement. The last government also decided to switch the State Opening from its traditional November date to the Spring.Does The Queen write the Speech?No. It is written by ministers but is delivered by the Sovereign from the throne of the House of Lords on behalf of Her Majesty's government. The Speech varies in length from year to year, depending on the number of actual bills and other items - such as draft legislation and foreign policy objectives - included but normally takes about 10 minutes. The Queen, to whom the document is sent beforehand for signing, also uses the occasion to give details of upcoming visits to the UK by other heads of state and any state visits she is making overseas.Does The Queen come every year?Pretty much but not quite. This will be the 64th time during her reign that she has delivered the Speech. She has been absent on two occasions, in 1959 and 1963, when she was pregnant. On those occasions, the Speech was read by the Lord Chancellor. Is there a lot of pomp and ceremony involved?Yes. The State Opening begins with the Queen's procession from Buckingham Palace to Westminster, escorted by the Household Cavalry - an event which always draws large crowds along the route.The Queen arrives at Sovereign's Entrance and proceeds to the Robing Room. Wearing the Imperial State Crown and the Robe of State, she leads the Royal Procession through the Royal Gallery, packed with guests, to the chamber of the House of Lords.The House of Lords official known as 'Black Rod' is sent to summon the Commons. The doors to the Commons chamber are shut in his face: a practice dating back to the Civil War, symbolising the Commons' independence from the monarchy. Black Rod strikes the door three times before it is opened. MPs then follow Black Rod and the Commons Speaker to the Lords chamber, standing at the opposite end to the Throne, known as the Bar of the House, to listen to the speech.The speech itself is carried into the Chamber by the Lord Chancellor in a satchel. He hands the speech to the Sovereign and takes possession of it again once it has been delivered.Until a few years ago, the Speech was written on a rare form of calf's skin known as vellum. It is now written on high-quality parchment paper. What happens after the Speech?The Queen returns to Buckingham Palace while MPs and peers break for lunch. A couple of hours later MPs reassemble in the Commons to begin debating the Speech. After introductory speeches by two MPs - traditionally one a relative newcomer and the other a long-serving member - the prime minister gets to his feet to ""sell"" the Speech to the Commons, explaining what is in it and what it says about his vision for the country and the changes he wants to make.The leader of the opposition then gets their chance to respond before backbenchers chip in. The debate on what is known as the ""Humble Address"" normally lasts about five days, with a largely symbolic vote taking place at the end.Peers also debate the Queen's Speech but do not vote on it.It is in the Queen's Speech. That means it will happen?Not necessarily. The Queen's Speech is the equivalent of the government's ""mission statement"" for the year ahead but that does not mean everything in it will become law. There are plenty of examples of proposed legislation which fall by the wayside due to political opposition. A recent high-profile example was a bill proposing elections to the House of Lords in 2012, which was withdrawn four months after being announced by the coalition government.In contrast, there are bills which are not mentioned in the Queen's Speech which are subsequently introduced in response to changing circumstances. One example from the last session was a bill allowing female bishops to sit in the House of Lords. There were 11 full bills included in the 2014 Queen's Speech but Parliament ended up approving 26 bills during the 2014-5 session. Traditionally, the first Queen's Speech of a new Parliament tends to contain more bills than later ones as ministers seek to capitalise on the momentum of their party's election victory, at a time when the opposition is often at its most divided."
2015-05-27,Lessons from Wilson,https://web.archive.org//web/20150528020736/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32844483,"Three days after the first general election in 1974, which led to Harold Wilson unexpectedly taking office as prime minister of a minority Labour government, his friend and colleague Barbara Castle sat down in her bolthole, Hell Corner Farm, in the Buckinghamshire countryside to update her diary. ""So here we go for a bumpy ride,"" she wrote. It was, if anything, something of an underestimate of the five years that lay ahead.It was already obvious that day, that a second election would have to be held. After a difficult few months, Wilson went to the country in October and was rewarded with an overall majority of just three seats in the House of Commons. Yet during that spring and summer, despite numerous parliamentary defeats, the government took steps to control inflation, keep mortgage rates down, and reduce VAT.It also introduced legislation on sharing the revenues of North Sea oil more fairly than before, and established a social contract with the trade unions to try to limit strike action through agreed controls on pay rises. Once he had a majority government, the limits that were imposed on Wilson's subsequent ability to manage a competent administration, were more often to come from political problems within his own party than from his slender overall command of the Commons.So it may also prove for David Cameron, recently re-installed as prime minister, but now for the first time as a man with a mandate. He has an overall majority in the House of 12 seats, considerably less than the 76 he could count on in coalition with the Liberal Democrats.But as Wilson and his successor, James Callaghan, found in the 1970s there will be many occasions when some of the smaller parties may willingly pitch in to support the government.February:Labour: Seats won: 301, up 20. Share of vote: 37.2%Conservative: Seats won: 297, down 37. Share of vote: 37.9%Liberal: Seats won: 14, up eight. Share of vote: 19.3%Turnout: 78.8%October:Labour: Seats won: 319, up 18. Share of vote: 39.2%Conservative: Seats won: 277, down 20. Share of vote: 35.8%Liberal: Seats won: 13, down 1. Share of vote: 18.3%Turnout: 72.8%Uncanny political parallels with 1974It was, as Castle predicted, a bumpy ride, but it was also an immensely exciting one. I had already worked at Westminster for three years at the time but I became a lobby correspondent in 1974 and therefore had access to the inside track of the political circuit. It was in the bars and lobbies and restaurants that the planning and plotting and political manoeuvring took place.But the chamber of the Commons itself was also one of the most rewarding places to observe the spectacle of government. Time and time again I can recall sliding into my seat in the Press Gallery, wondering how on earth Wilson was going to get out of whatever the latest crisis was to engulf him. Summoning up the spirit of those fevered times is not difficult in the context of the following: It was perhaps scarcely surprising, as Bernard Donoughue, head of the Number 10 Policy Unit, noted repeatedly in his Downing Street Diaries, that Wilson was cracking open the brandy bottle at noon and knocking it back until late at night. Wilson was a superb operator with a mastery of the House of Commons but the strains took their toll.He became increasingly paranoid about leaks and the press and the security services, about his warring party and supposed colleagues and the fact - yes, Barbara! - that so many of them were keeping diaries with a view to publication. He hated Question Time and needed those brandies just to get through the then 30-minute session once a week. His decision to resign in 1976 astonished the political world at the time but maybe in retrospect it should not have been such a surprise. The Labour government had by then achieved a great deal without the necessity to compromise, except occasionally with its own supporters, but it was hard fought. Four nights a week there would be crucial votes, sometimes a series of votes lasting a couple of hours, from 10pm. It was an administration run by a necessarily powerful Whips' Office and what was to follow under Callaghan would prove even more tense. In early 1977 the Callaghan government lost its overall majority, which had been whittled away in by-elections, and the new leader of the Opposition, Margaret Thatcher, put down a vote of no confidence. It led to negotiations with the Liberal leader, David Steel, at the head of a group of 13 MPs, for the formation of the Lib-Lab Pact. It was an agreement under which the Liberals supported the government in return for policy consultation, and lasted until the autumn of 1978. The Liberals got little from it, apart from a tweak at the black petticoat of power, but by then it was anticipated that Callaghan would shortly call an election.His failure to do so and the subsequent industrial ""winter of discontent"" would lead to Labour being out of government for 18 years.David Cameron is on an electoral honeymoon at the moment but the forthcoming Queen's Speech will give the new Commons a taste of what lies ahead. It will also serve notice to the Conservative government's opponents in the House of Lords, where it is heavily outnumbered by the current composition of the upper House.And then there is, as ever, the question of Europe. The prime minister and his chief whip, Mark Harper, might both find a study of the 1970s quite helpful over the next few days."

2015-05-28,MEPs in new EU-US trade controversy,https://web.archive.org//web/20150529053538/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-32916750,"Euro MPs have called for transparent and public handling of trade disputes with the US, but they have softened their stance on much-criticised commercial courts.The MEP panel's report on EU-US free trade talks - called the TTIP talks - goes before the full European Parliament for a vote on 10 June.A major European consumer group, BEUC, criticised the report, as did Green and socialist MEPs.MEPs can veto an EU-US trade deal.The stakes are high in TTIP - it could create the world's biggest free trade zone, giving a much-needed boost to business on both sides of the Atlantic. The parliament's trade committee passed the package of recommendations by 28 votes to 13 on Thursday. A German Social Democrat, Bernd Lange, was the lead MEP who drafted report.The American Chamber of Commerce in the EU called the report ""a significant positive step of support towards the trade deal"" and noted the EU's ""commitment to transparency and democratic principles as key elements"". One of the most controversial aspects of TTIP is the investment rules. It remains unclear whether a foreign investor would have access to a system known as investor state dispute settlement, or ISDS. Critics say ISDS tribunals lack transparency and can give too much leverage to powerful corporations in disputes with states.The original draft of the MEPs' report said fair, non-discriminatory treatment of foreign investors ""can be achieved without the inclusion of an ISDS mechanism - such a mechanism is not necessary in TTIP given the EU's and US' developed legal systems"".However, a later amendment dropped that mention of ISDS. It called simply for investment cases to be treated ""in a transparent manner by publicly appointed, independent professional judges in public hearings"", with respect for national courts' jurisdiction.BEUC said that ""deplorably"" the MEPs ""took a very ambiguous stance"" on ISDS. ""We have yet to see any facts justifying its inclusion in an EU/US trade deal. We hope MEPs when voting in plenary will demand the exclusion of this outdated, discriminatory and unneeded mechanism.""And a leading Green MEP, Yannick Jadot, said the report ""does not reflect the ever growing concern among the public and civil society with the TTIP negotiations and their overt corporate agenda"".  But British Labour MEP David Martin praised the report's demand for ""strong protection of labour and environmental rules"" and ""bringing an end to secret investor tribunals"". The MEPs' views influence the European Commission's stance in the wide-ranging trade talks, covering issues such as food safety, data protection, trademarks and competition in transport and public procurement.

2015-05-28,Bill-by-bill: Queen's Speech,https://web.archive.org//web/20150529053538/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32898443,"The government's legislative plans for the year ahead have been unveiled in the Queen's Speech to Parliament. Here is a guide to the bills that were announced.This will pave the way for an in/out referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union. David Cameron has promised to renegotiate Britain's relationship with the 28-member bloc and put it to a public vote by 2017 at the latest. There is speculation it could be held as early as autumn 2016.This bill, as the name would suggest, is designed to achieve full employment ""and provide more people with the security of a job"". The aim is for two million more jobs and three million new apprenticeships to be created. Ministers will be required to report annually to Parliament on their progress. The legislation will also implement a planned reduction in the welfare cap - from £26,000 to £23,000, and freeze working-age benefits, tax credit and child benefit for two years. As part of the government's welfare reforms, young people will be required to ""earn or learn"", with automatic entitlement to housing benefit for 18-21-year-olds scrapped.Read more details on gov.ukThis bill will include measures to reduce regulation on small businesses in a bid to boost job creation. It will seek to cut red tape for British business by at least £10bn and, for the first time, require independent regulators to contribute to that target. In addition, it proposes to create a new Small Business Conciliation Service, to help settle disputes between small and large businesses, especially over late payment practices. The government also aims to improve the business rates system ahead of the 2017 revaluation, including by modernising the appeals system. And it proposes to introduce a cap on public sector redundancy payments. to six figures for the highest earners.This wide-ranging bill is designed to enact a series of tax pledges made by the Conservatives during the general election campaign. Specifically that there would be no rise in income tax rates, VAT or national insurance before 2020 and that ""no one working 30 hours on the minimum wage pays any income tax at all"". It will also enact a commitment to raise the threshold before which people pay income tax to £12,500 - a move ministers say will benefit 30 million people. The government says the purpose of the bill is to ""reward those who work hard and do the right thing"".A Childcare Bill will include measures to help working people ""by greatly increasing the provision of free childcare"". Under the proposals, parents in England would be entitled to 30 hours a week of free childcare for their three- and four-year-olds, for 38 weeks of the year. Currently, they are entitled to 570 hours of free early education or childcare a year, which works out as 15 hours each week over the 38-week period.Plans to support home ownership and extend the right-to-buy scheme to 1.3 million social housing tenants in England feature in a new Housing Bill. Under the plans, housing association tenants will be able to buy the homes they rent at a discount.

Its Immigration Bill is designed to support working people, clamp down on illegal immigration and protect public services. Specifically, it will include a new offence of illegal working - with police given the power to seize the wages paid to illegal workers as the ""proceeds of crime"". There are also proposals to deal with unscrupulous landlords and to evict illegal migrants more quickly, while all foreign criminals awaiting deportation will be fitted with satellite tracking tags. It will also become an offence for businesses and recruitment agencies to hire abroad without first advertising in the UK - a policy which featured prominently in Labour's election manifesto - and a new enforcement agency will be set up to tackle what the prime minister called ""the worst cases of exploitation""Read more details on gov.ukThis paves the way for powers over housing, transport, planning and policing to be devolved to England's cities as part of government plans for ""a balanced economic recovery"". Cities that want them will be able to have elected mayors. Chancellor George Osborne has said previously that Greater Manchester - which will take on the powers when electing a mayor in two years - should become a blueprint for other large cities.The government is pressing ahead with legislation that will eventually enable work to start on the £50bn HS2 high-speed rail link. Legislation which will give the government the legal powers to construct and operate the London to Birmingham first phase of HS2 is going through Parliament.

The Scottish Parliament will be given new tax and welfare powers, under the proposals. It follows the recommendations of the Smith Commission on Scottish devolution.There will also be further devolution of powers to Wales, under the government's plans, including a new reserved powers model to clarify the division of powers between the Welsh Assembly and Parliament. The assembly will also be given more powers over energy, transport and local government elections in Wales.Continuing the devolution theme, there will be a bill to give effect to the Stormont House Agreement in Northern Ireland. It will provide for full and independent investigations into ""unsolved Troubles-related deaths"", the government says.Read more details on gov.ukLegislation to introduce a blanket ban on so-called legal highs featured in the Queen's Speech.

It would be an offence to produce, supply, offer to supply, possess, import or export psychoactive substances. The proposal was included in the Conservatives' general election manifesto.Read more details on gov.ukThis includes measures to tackle broadcasting of extremist material. The government wants to strengthen watchdog Ofcom so that it can take action against channels that transmit extremist content. The legislation will also propose the introduction of banning orders for extremist organisations who use hate speech in public places, but whose activities fall short of proscription. A new power to allow police and local authorities to close down premises used to support extremism will also feature. And employers will be able to check whether an individual is an extremist and barring them from working with children.""New legislation will modernise the law on communications data,"" the speech said. An Investigatory Powers Bill will revive plans to give intelligence agencies new tools to target communications data - branded a ""snooper's charter"" by critics. The government says it will equip the police intelligence agencies with the tools to keep people safe.The government is promising to ""improve the law"" in this area to make communities ""safer"" and to ""build confidence and improve efficiency"" in the criminal justice system.

Time limits will also be introduced on a mandate following a ballot for industrial action. The government says the aim is to ensure that strikes are the result of ""clear, positive and recent decisions"" by union members as well as ensuring that disruption to essential public services has a democratic mandate. There will also be the introduction of ""a transparent opt-in process for the political fund element of trade union subscriptions"", along the lines of the Northern Ireland system. Read more details on gov.ukThis bill is designed to raise standards in schools. Under the plans, new powers would be brought forward to speed up the process of changing a failing school's leadership and turning it into an academy.

Read more details on gov.ukThe speech set out plans for legislation to scrap the current 15-year time limit on UK citizens living abroad voting in Westminster and European elections. The government says it would make it easier for overseas electors to cast their votes in time to be counted, and encourage larger numbers of British citizens living abroad to register to vote in UK elections. Read more details on gov.ukThe purpose of this bill is to give UK approval to the financing aspect of the seven year EU Budget deal agreed in 2013, which saw a real-terms cut in EU spending.

Read more details on gov.ukThis bill would provide the option for combined authority areas with directly-elected mayors to be responsible for the running of their local bus services. The government says the move would allow cities to promote an integrated transport system. Read more details on gov.ukThis is the one draft bill to feature in the Queen's Speech. It proposed to reform and modernise the Public Service Ombudsman sector to provide ""a more effective and accessible final tier of complaints redress within the public sector"". It would absorb the functions of the Parliamentary Ombudsman, the Health Ombudsman, and the Local Government Ombudsman and potentially the Housing Ombudsman.Although it appears in the Queen's Speech, there is no legislation, either in full or draft form, on a British Bill of Rights. Instead, ministers will consult on the pros of replacing the Human Rights Act with a new legal framework of rights and responsibilities. There is no mention of any plan to repeal the ban on hunting of wild mammals with hounds, in force since 2005. Ministers have suggested MPs will be given an opportunity to decide on the matter by 2020, and will be given a free vote. "

2015-05-28,Sturgeon critical of Scotland Bill,https://web.archive.org//web/20150529053538/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32902734,"First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has criticised the newly published Scotland Bill saying it falls short in ""almost every way"".However, the UK government insisted the legislation fulfilled promises made after the Scottish independence vote.Ms Sturgeon told MSPs the Bill did not contain the welfare powers promised.The 76-page document was published the day after the Queen's Speech outlined the Conservative government's plan to give tax-raising powers to Scotland.Prime Minister David Cameron believed the plan would make Scotland the most powerful devolved assembly anywhere in the world.Its key elements include:The Scotland Bill follows recommendations made by the cross-party Smith Commission which was set up to look at devolving more powers to Scotland.In response to a question from SNP MSP Kenneth Gibson during First Minister's Questions at Holyrood, Ms Sturgeon said: ""The UK government, I think, had a very clear test today to deliver a bill which lived up in full, in spirit and in letter, to the Smith Commission.""The bill has been published within the last hour or so and from my glance at it, I think it falls short in almost every area.""The bill, for example, doesn't contain the full welfare powers recommended by the Smith Commission and in some key powers it retains, unbelievably in my view, given the amount of concern that was expressed about this, it retains a veto for the UK government on key policy areas.""So, for example, if this parliament wants to abolish the bedroom tax, as I hope we do, the UK government would still have a right of veto over whether we could do it or not. Now I'm sorry, but that is not devolution.""However, Secretary of State for Scotland, David Mundell, disagreed with the Scottish government's assessment.He said: ""The government will be delivering the Smith Commission in full, we are starting that parliamentary journey which will lead to the Scottish Parliament having control over income tax in Scotland, over £2.5bn of welfare spend and a raft of other measures which will help economic and job creation.""Mr Mundell added: ""Scotland will still hold on to the benefits of being part of the UK that people voted for in the referendum last September. ""Sharing risks and resources with the rest of the UK is good for everyone in the UK when it comes to vital matters such as pensions, currency, trade and national security.""Leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats, Willie Rennie, said that the Scotland Bill must be ""grasped as an opportunity to move past the divisions of the independence referendum"".He explained: ""The Scotland Bill is an opportunity to move past the divisions of the independence referendum. It is a big package of powers and a big moment for Scotland.""With £20bn in tax raising powers and £3bn welfare budget, these powers offer flexibility to do things differently if we choose. But it also retains the pooling and sharing of resources which come from being part of something bigger.""Labour's Ian Murray said his party was committed to seeing the ""vow"", made by Unionist parties for more Scottish devolution, fulfilled.But he believed it right to pursue an amendment to the Scotland Bill that would enable the Scottish Parliament to have the final say on welfare and benefits.Mr Murray said: ""Labour amendments to the Scotland Bill will give the Scottish Parliament the power to top up UK benefits, and create new benefits of our own. Scotland will have the powers to defend the vulnerable against Tory austerity whilst retaining the UK wide pooling and sharing of resources offered by the Barnett Formula. It's about simple fairness.""If the bill passes the usual parliamentary hurdles it could become law early next year, ahead of the Holyrood elections in May 2016.A new Scotland Bill will be based on recommendations made by the Smith Commission - the cross-party group formed after the independence referendum to look at what additional powers might be handed to Scotland.But how were its foundations laid?

We know, of course, it is not traditional practice in the chamber but we didn't know just how unacceptable it might be found. We will refrain from doing that again.""It will take us time to learn the processes that work here, it will take us time to get our feet under the table and it will take you time to get used to us. But I hope we will be able to do that in the weeks and months ahead.""The SNP group has begun calling ""hear hear"", as is traditional in the Commons."

There's likely to be more discussion about it, but I'm led to believe that what we are heading towards is a question along the lines of whether the UK should remain in the EU.""That is significant because it would allow those who want the status quo to continue once there has been a renegotiation, who want the UK to remain a member of the EU, to style themselves as the Yes campaign. Yes to stay in, Yes to remain.""So it could be that there is some discussion of that over the coming days.""In the Queen's Speech, Mr Cameron said he would renegotiate the UK's membership and pursue reform of the European Union ""for the benefit of all member states"", pledging ""early legislation"" to pave the way for a referendum by the end of 2017.Downing Street said this would give the public a ""voice and a real choice on Europe"". It has also confirmed that members of the House of Lords and citizens of Commonwealth countries living in Gibraltar will be entitled to vote in the referendum - as well as UK nationals who have been living abroad for less than 15 years."

He said in a statement posted on his Twitter feed that had been uncomfortable with the level of ""sheer pressure"" and scrutiny that came with being a candidate.The 36-year-old added that it had perhaps been ""too soon"" for him to launch a leadership bid.Another rising star of the 2010 intake, the MP for Leeds West was appointed shadow chief secretary to the Treasury in 2011 and shadow work and pensions secretary in 2013.During the election campaign, she attacked the so-called bedroom tax, whereby housing benefit payments are reduced for tenants in council and social housing deemed to have spare rooms.However, she also suggested Labour would consider reducing the overall welfare cap in some areas.She told BBC News Labour needs ""to be in the centre ground to win a general election"" but ruled herself out of a leadership bid.A former home secretary and shadow chancellor, Alan Johnson is the Labour leadership candidate who never quite was.The popular MP declined to stand in 2010 and stepped down from his shadow cabinet role in 2011 for personal reasons.Earlier this year it was reported that senior New Labour figures Lord Mandelson and Alistair Campbell approached Mr Johnson over a leadership bid, although all three later distanced themselves from the story.But the former postman, who has been MP for Hull West and Hessle since 1997, had seemingly ruled himself out again, saying it is a ""10-year job"" and he does not have the ""right qualities"". Former army officer Dan Jarvis was elected MP for Barnsley Central in a by-election in 2011, having resigned his commission as a major in the Parachute Regiment to contest the seat.He held onto his seat at the general election, taking time out from campaigning to run the London Marathon last month.After entering Parliament in 2010, he quickly became a shadow culture, media and sport minister and later a shadow justice minister.In 2011, Mr Jarvis became the first serving politician in more than 60 years to be awarded a military honour, when he was made an MBE for his services to the armed forces.He has been touted by some colleagues as a future Labour leader but Mr Jarvis, who was widowed in 2010 and has a young family, ruled himself out, saying it is not the ""right time"" for him and his family. Historian and journalist Tristram Hunt entered Parliament in 2010 as Labour MP for Stoke-on-Trent Central.Ed Miliband made him shadow education secretary in 2013 and he has been a fierce critic of the coalition's education policies in England.Speaking in the aftermath of the election results, he called on Labour's ruling National Executive Committee ""not to rush our election"", saying there was time for a ""brutal post-mortem"" about Labour's ""underlying philosophy and thinking"".As for his own ambitions, he said ""it's about the lyrics as much as the lead singer I think"".He later said he was not confident of getting enough nominations to stand, and would support Liz Kendall.The MP for Rochdale says the deputy leader vacancy has ""come a bit too soon"" for him.He previously said a number of colleagues had asked him to put his name forward for the role.Mr Danczuk is well known for his prominent campaigning against child sex abuse and leading calls for an inquiry into allegations of historical child sex abuse by senior figures at Westminster.He was a vocal critic of Ed Miliband and in an article for the Daily Telegraph on Thursday he said Labour needed to ""step out if its Metropolitan comfort zone"" and ""reach out to the country once more.""The former director of public prosecutions has only just become an MP after being elected in Frank Dobson's old seat of Holborn and St Pancras, in North London at the general election.He was forced to rule himself out of the race to be Labour leader following a social media campaign urging him to stand.He said he was ""flattered"" by the campaign but the party needed someone with ""more political experience"".The older brother of ex-leader Ed, David Miliband was frontrunner to replace Gordon Brown in 2010, until his sibling beat him by a whisker.A former foreign secretary and MP for South Shields, he was the Blairite choice for leader but eventually quit Parliament to become head of the International Rescue Committee charity in New York in 2013.Speaking to the BBC from the US on the Monday after the general election, Mr Miliband criticised his brother's campaign in the 2015 general election, saying he and Mr Brown had ""allowed themselves to be portrayed as moving backwards from the principles of aspiration and inclusion that are the absolute heart of any successful progressive political project"".While he acknowledged the two men were ""brothers for life"", he also confirmed he was not eligible to stand for the party leadership as he is not an MP.Labour's election rulesMPs wishing to stand as leader and deputy leader have to be nominated by 15% of their colleagues in the Parliamentary Labour Party to be eligible to stand.As Labour now has 232 MPs, this means prospective candidates must get at least 34 signatures. That means the maximum size of any field is six contenders.Under rules agreed last year, all Labour Party members, registered supporters and affiliated supporters - including union members - will be allowed a maximum of one vote each on a one member, one vote system. When the election is held, they will be asked to rank candidates in order of preference.If no candidate gets 50% of all votes cast, the votes will be added up and the candidate with the fewest votes eliminated. Their 2nd preference votes will then be redistributed until one candidate has 50% of all votes cast."

2015-05-28,Round-up: BBC experts' analysis,https://web.archive.org//web/20150529053538/http://www.bbc.com/news/election-2015-32650417,"The political future of the United Kingdom has become clearer after the results of the general election emerged around the country.David Cameron says he hopes to govern for all of the UK after the Conservatives took 331 seats - enough to form a slender majority in the Commons.Labour has been all but wiped out by the SNP in Scotland and suffered a disappointing set of results elsewhere, while the Lib Dems are left with just eight MPs after many party heavyweights such as Vince Cable and Danny Alexander lost their seats.So with battles won and lost and the fall-out and celebrations beginning, BBC correspondents examine the implications and challenges that lie ahead for the new government - and for those whose political careers have been ended by voters.No pollster, no pundit, no political leader saw it coming - not even David Cameron himself.Governing parties don't gain seats. Parties that have implemented painful cuts and are promising more certainly don't. Until that is the Conservative Party did - achieving what had seemed to be Mission Impossible - a Tory majority.Until that is David Cameron's personal triumph which triggered the near simultaneous resignation of his three principle opponents - Messrs Miliband, Clegg and Farage.They did so in part because they helped to crush their partners in coalition these last five years - reducing the Liberal Democrat parliamentary party to a size when it can fit into two London taxis and still have two seats to spare.In part because the extraordinary tidal wave of support for the SNP swept dozens of once safe Labour seats away.In part because Nigel Farage persuaded millions to vote for him but secured just one seat - not, though, the one he was standing in.Read more from Nick Robinson hereThe question uppermost in the prime minister's mind as he assembles his new government is how to keep the kingdom united.""Above all I want to bring our country together,"" he revealed after the result, ""to reclaim a mantle we should never have lost - the mantle of one nation, one United Kingdom"".Looking at the political landscape from Land's End today is very different to the view from John O'Groats.A sea of Conservative and Unionist blue dominates the scene across much of England, while a field of SNP nationalist yellow stretches to the horizon and beyond from the north.David Cameron's greatest challenge is to prevent the union he supports being torn apart by mutual resentment - resentment from Scotland at a Westminster government dominated by English Tories, and resentment from England at the preferential treatment people think is being given to the Scots.Those who assumed the future of the Union had been safeguarded by the Scottish referendum must think again.Read more from Mark Easton hereOne thing is rock-solid true: the Conservatives who worked on this campaign are as surprised by the result as the pollsters, pundits, politicians and general population.Maybe they shouldn't be - the economy is in good shape and the Conservatives had incumbency advantage.But when I travelled back from the prime minister's last rally with a group of exhausted Conservative campaign officials it was clear that 290 seats was a hoped-for target.No-one talked about anything over 300 seats, and no-one even mentioned an overall majority.So what special sauce pushed David Cameron into No 10 with a Commons majority?Mr Cameron had two simple messages in the campaign and he rarely veered away from them; the first - the economy is in good shape and the recovery is threatened by Labour. And the second - the SNP would hold a Labour-led government to ransom.Read more from Jonny Dymond hereBrian Taylor, BBC political editor, ScotlandOf all the comments on the overnight apocalypse, undoubtedly the most straightforward came from a defeated Scottish Labour MP.Since there were quite a few of them, let me narrow the focus a little. Come on down, Tom Harris.Mr Harris had plainly anticipated defeat. Nonetheless, he looked suitably lugubrious as his fate was confirmed.Why, he was asked eagerly, had Labour lost? ""Because we did not win enough votes.""Psephologically, it is perfect. Complete in itself. Psychologically, it sums up Labour's gloom without descending into subsidiary matters such as leadership, strategy and the rest. As a forward-thinking strategy, it is ideal. Win more votes. Simple.Read more from Brian Taylor hereThis has been an election which may have more profound consequences than almost any in living memory.We now face a generational decision about our future in Europe, with an EU referendum in two years' time almost certain.There will also be serious questions about the future of the Union, following an SNP landslide that has turned Scotland into a virtual one-party state.David Cameron's victory also represents a colossal achievement.Only once before in recent history has an incumbent government increased its majority - and that was Mrs Thatcher in her prime in the 1980s.It is also a significant personal victory for Mr Cameron and a rebuff for those in his party who had become increasingly sceptical about his ability to win.But while it may represent a defeat for those Tories who saw this election as a potential opportunity to rid themselves of David Cameron, he must now govern with a wafer-thin majority.For the SNP, their stunning victory can only increase the pressure on Nicola Sturgeon to include a commitment to a second independence referendum in her party's manifesto for next year's Scottish elections.It is an election which has not just defied all the predictions of the pollsters and pundits - but which may yet prompt the most fundamental re-casting of British politics for a generation.Read more from Norman Smith hereAfter an extraordinary night, some brief conclusions:Read more from James Landale hereIs this the end of the union?That is the question many people will be asking this morning after the party which has fought for Scottish independence for 80 years swept to victory.The answer from the jubilant Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon is a firm ""No"".She insists that her MPs will speak for all of Scotland, not just for the 45% who voted for the country to leave the United Kingdom last September.In the closing hours of the most extraordinary election campaign which anyone in Scotland can remember, Ms Sturgeon turned to talk of ""legitimacy.""That will be her watchword in the coming days as she argues that the prime minister cannot ignore the democratic will of the Scottish people.Politically, Scotland and England this morning look and feel like very different countries.Read more from James Cook hereAfter weeks of chatter about an election too close to call, it wasn't that close at all.David Cameron will be continuing as our prime minister.So, what is all this likely to mean?A referendum on whether the UK stays in, or leaves, the European Union, within the next two-and-a-half years.A race to be the next leader of the Labour Party.A race to be the next leader of the Liberal Democrats.And a huge new presence of Scottish National Party MPs at Westminster.And so here's another thing we know for certain this morning: Politics ain't going to be boring any time soon.Read more from Chris Mason hereFor Labour the story of their terrible night is rapidly turning into the search for a new leader. So who will that be?Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, is almost certain to run.  Even before this election, both he and another almost inevitable candidate, Chuka Umunna, had raised eyebrows inside the party at the work they had put in, preparing the ground with members and the unions for potential bids.Yvette Cooper, before the election, was still thought not to have made up her mind over whether to run. That decision has been made perhaps a little easier as her husband, Ed Balls, has lost his seat.She is certainly potentially in the frame, along with two lesser known names - Liz Kendall and Dan Jarvis - two MPs who were only elected in 2010 for the first time. This could be their moment. But whoever is in the job, they face a monumental task.Read Laura Kuenssberg's Twitter hereSterling is up (the most for seven years against the euro), share prices are up (especially bank shares like Lloyds and RBS, and energy shares such as Centrica), government bond prices are up.To state the obvious, investors love the Tories' general election victory.There are a few reasons.One (no surprise here) is that Labour's threat of breaking up banks and imposing energy price caps has been lifted.Second is that investors have been discounting days and weeks of wrangling after polling day over who would form the government - and so they are semi-euphoric that we already know who's in charge.Third, many investors tend to be economically conservative and instinctively Conservative.But although the City may be a bit drunk on the result, its pleasure in Ed Miliband's and Ed Balls' humiliation may be making it a bit blind - perhaps dangerously so - to some bumps in the economic road ahead.Read more from Robert Peston hereNigel Farage dreamed of holding the balance of power, but in the end his UKIP party is now worse off than when it came into the election.At the seventh time of asking he was rejected - this time by the people of Thanet South. It was a similar story in Rochester and Strood where Mark Reckless, who sensationally defected from the Tories last year, was also sent packing.In seats on UKIP's target list, like Thurrock in Essex, the party failed to make gains. In Grimsby - where Mr Farage went twice in the last six weeks - they came third.UKIP got around four million votes - with especially strong showings in north-east and south-east England - but it's ended up with just one MP, and a vacancy at the top. This has led to UKIP attacking the current system of choosing MPs, which it's described as ""busted"" and ""dysfunctional"".In one sense, this campaign was a complete failure and it's left an aftermath of angry voters, and others wondering if the UKIP bubble has burst.Read Robin Brant's Twitter hereI monitored 91 GB-wide voting intention polls during the 2015 election campaign and found nothing in them to prepare me for the final outcome.The good news for the pollsters was that their share for the Lib Dems was pretty close, as were the shares for UKIP, the Greens and the catch-all category of Others.The bad news for the polling industry was that the crucial shares for Conservative and Labour were the ones where they came most adrift.When all the qualifications of margins of error are allowed, there did appear to be a systematic overstatement of the Labour share and an equally systematic understatement of the Conservative one.It is for the pollsters to decide whether to conduct a review of their performance but I trust they will avoid the initial knee-jerk reaction of the immediate aftermath of the 1992 polls debacle.This general election performance follows the performance of the polls in the 2014 Scottish referendum where the choice was simply binary and yet all the polls were out by between 4-6%.Something is wrong. A lot of us would like to know what it is.Read more from David Cowling hereThe words ""political earthquake"" have been translated into numerous European languages, making front page news across the continent.While Britons now examine the domestic minutiae of the election result, here in mainland Europe the vote means one thing: a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU. And that has the potential to create an earthquake of its own.The guardian of the EU treaties Mr Cameron wants to change - Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker - has said again he'd listen to what Britain's new government proposed.Read more from Katya Adler here"

2015-05-28,"EU referendum: What, when and why?",https://web.archive.org//web/20150529053538/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"The UK is set to have a referendum by the end of 2017 on whether or not to remain a member of the European Union.The Conservatives' election manifesto promised to hold a referendum (a nationwide vote) on whether or not the UK should stay in or leave the European Union. They won the election so it's all systems go.A referendum is basically a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part, normally giving a ""Yes"" or ""No"" answer to a question. Whichever side gets more than half of all votes cast is considered to have won.The European Union is an economic and political partnership between 28 European countries. It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, its own parliament and it now sets the rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things like mobile phone charges.The one thing we know for sure is that Prime Minister David Cameron has said it will happen by the end of 2017. The most likely times of the year for referendums are generally May or September, and some people think it should be held as soon as possible - possibly even in May 2016, to coincide with elections in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and London, rather than waiting for 2017. When David Cameron announced in January 2013 his pledge to hold a referendum, a key element was that he would seek to make changes to the way the European Union works - or at least the rules covering the UK as a European Union member. Only once this renegotiation of British membership had been completed would he put the new arrangement to the public vote.During the election the Lib Dems and Labour both said they did not want a referendum unless there were plans to transfer more powers from the UK to the EU. Labour has since dropped its opposition, so the Conservatives are expected to get their Referendum Bill passed easily. The House of Lords could delay it, but as the referendum was promised in the Conservative election manifesto (a manifesto is a document setting out what a party would do if they won the election) it is not likely to reject the bill once MPs back it.The question is always crucial in any referendum and there is already debate about what it should be. The 2013 suggestion from the Conservatives was: ""Do you think that the United Kingdom should remain a member of the European Union?"" Some people thought this phrasing leaned too far towards the status quo - the current state of affairs - and the Electoral Commission, which has to approve the question, said it was not clear enough and proposed:""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union?""Read more: Does the wording of a referendum question matter?British, Irish and Commonwealth citizens over 18 who are resident in the UK, along with UK nationals who have lived overseas for less than 15 years. Members of the House of Lords and Commonwealth citizens in Gibraltar will also be eligible, unlike in a general election. Citizens from EU countries - apart from Ireland, Malta and Cyprus - will not get a vote.Mr Cameron is not revealing the full details of what he wants from the other EU leaders ahead of negotiations - but he is expected to demand an opt-out from one of its core principles of forging an ""ever-closer union"" between member states. He will also try to get restrictions on welfare benefits - in particular, tax credits - for migrants and more powers to block or opt out of new EU laws.Read more: Q&A: What Britain wants from EuropeBritain had a referendum in 1975 shortly after it had joined the EU, or the Common Market as it was then called. The country voted to stay in then but there have been growing calls, from the public and politicians, for another vote because, they argue, the EU has changed a lot over the past 40 years, with many more countries joining and the organisation extending its control over more aspects of daily lives. David Cameron initially resisted these calls but in 2013 he changed his mind.About 33% of the British public, according to the latest opinion polls. The UK Independence Party, which won the last European elections, and received nearly four million votes, 13% of those cast, in May's general election, campaigns for Britain's exit from the EU. A fair number of Conservative MPs - and several Labour ones - are also thought to be strongly in favour of leaving.They believe Britain is being held back by the EU, which they say imposes too many rules on business and charges billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also want Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. They also object to the idea of ""ever closer union"" and the belief that the ultimate goal is to create a ""United States of Europe"".David Cameron wants Britain to stay in the EU, once he has got some powers back from it. He has so far refused to say whether he would start calling for Britain to leave if he does not get what he wants from the other EU leaders. The Labour Party, SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems are also in favour of staying in. Latest opinion polls suggest 45% of the British public agree with them.They believe Britain gets a big boost from EU membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argue, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also believe Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving.It depends which way you look at it - or what you believe is important. Leaving the EU would be a big step - arguably far more important than who wins the next general election - but would it set the nation free or condemn it to economic ruin? Here is a rundown of the arguments for and against.Big business - with a few exceptions - tends to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. The CBI president and BT chief Sir Mike Rake says there are ""no credible alternatives"" to staying in the EU. But others disagree, such as Lord Bamford, chairman of JCB, who says an EU exit would allow the UK to negotiate trade deals as our country ""rather than being one of 28 nations"". Many small- and medium-sized firms would welcome a cut in red tape and what they see as petty regulations, but a lot hangs on what deal Mr Cameron renegotiates. The British Chambers of Commerce says 55% of members back staying in a reformed EU.Find out more: Business for Britain wants big changes to the UK's relations with the EU and says the UK should be prepared to vote to leave if the changes are not achievedBusiness for New Europe is a coalition of business leaders who support the UK's membership of the EU and ""oppose withdrawal to the margins"".The Electoral Commission will be in charge of making sure it's a fair contest.  There will be official ""Yes"" and ""No"" campaigns, selected by the Commission, which will have to abide by strict spending limits. Anyone wanting to launch their own Yes or No campaign will have to register with the Commission if they plan to spend more than £10,000. They must be UK-based. The Commission says MPs should decide what kinds of organisations should be allowed to take part. Business groups, trade unions and pressure groups are all likely to want to have their say.There will also be rules to prevent organisations trying to get round the spending limits through multiple registrations. Political parties will also be allowed to campaign for the result they want to see.Anyone who runs an unregistered campaign will be limited to spending less than £10,000. The idea is to prevent wealthy foreigners, companies or governments trying to influence the outcome. The Electoral Commission has published preliminary guidelines.That is yet to be decided and will partly depend on what Mr Cameron achieves in his renegotiation of the terms of the UK's membership of the EU. He says he is confident he can get what he wants, in which case he would be expected to lead the ""staying in"" side. The highest profile supporter of leaving the EU is UKIP leader Nigel Farage, but there are likely to be other high profile politicians who support withdrawal - or, as with the anti-euro campaign a few years back, celebrities or business people could front an ""anti-politics"" campaign.Conservatives' election manifesto - including referendum pledgeTry these features:How to win a referendumWhat David Cameron wants from the EU negotiationsTimeline: Campaigns for a European Union referendumBusinesses give their views on a possible EU exit"
2015-05-28,What Britain wants from Europe,https://web.archive.org//web/20150529053538/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32695399,"David Cameron says he has a mandate to pursue EU reform following the Conservatives' general election victory. The PM, who will be hoping his majority government will give him extra leverage in Brussels, wants to renegotiate the terms of the UK's membership ahead of a referendum by the end of 2017. He has said he will campaign for Britain to remain in the EU if he gets the reforms he wants.Mr Cameron has said he does not want to reveal full details of his negotiating hand but he has given a broad indication, in a series of speeches and newspaper articles, of his priorities when he goes into talks with other EU leaders.These are: The prime minister has said Britain would resist any move towards a European Army and that he wants to free British police forces from EU interference. He has also ruled out Britain joining the euro.But he has placed less emphasis in recent years on demanding changes to EU social policy, such as the maximum 48-hour working week, agency workers, maternity leave and non-discrimination rules.The official UK government position is that a referendum will be held by the end of 2017 but Downing Street sources have said: ""If we can do it earlier we will.""There is speculation David Cameron is planning to hold the vote in 2016 to avoid a clash with French and German elections in 2017.The prime minister wants treaty change but even if the referendum was held in 2017 there may not be enough time to legally incorporate any reforms into a treaty and it would have to be done at a later stage.An early referendum would anger Eurosceptics who believe it would not allow enough time to make the case for exit or negotiate any meaningful concessions.""A rushed process would severely undermine the chances to secure a significant deal that both British business and voters could support and would waste the opportunity of a lifetime,"" Matthew Elliott, chief executive of Business for Britain told Breitbart London.The question is always crucial in any referendum and there is already a debate about what it should be. The Draft European Union (Referendum) Bill, published by the Conservatives in 2013, proposed this form of words: ""Do you think that the United Kingdom should remain a member of the European Union?""Some thought that leaned too far towards the status quo, encouraging a yes vote, and the Electoral Commission said it was not clear and direct enough. The watchdog proposed this form of words instead: ""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union?""The new Conservative government will attempt to repeal the Human Rights Act, which requires UK courts to treat the European Court of Human Rights as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. The European Court of Human Rights is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe (CoE), which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine.The freedom for people to move around Europe, enshrined in the EU treaties, works in parallel with the other three basic freedoms in the single market: freedom of goods, capital and services.It is likely to be a ""red line"" for other EU leaders, who do not want to see it eroded.Mr Cameron has steered clear of tackling it directly - for example by asking for an emergency ""brake"" on free movement, or a cap on numbers - focusing instead on reducing the incentive provided by welfare payments. In a speech last November, David Cameron set out measures to reduce the number of EU nationals moving to the UK.His main proposals were:Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission, has said he is ready to work with Mr Cameron to ""strike a fair deal for the United Kingdom in the EU"". The leaders of other EU nations have previously warned they are unlikely to support major changes to EU treaties to accommodate British demands. But Mr Cameron's general election victory may have given him extra leverage. ""The ball is very much in the court of the UK now,"" a senior EU official told The Guardian. ""It's up to the British to define what they want."" The key figure will be German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is very keen to keep Britain in the EU but has so far been unwilling to make major concessions to enable that to happen. There are fears that a ""pick and mix"" approach to EU treaties would undermine EU cohesion.Mr Cameron has said there is ""no doubt"" his planned reforms will require changes to the treaties governing the European Union. But this would require the unanimous support of all EU members, and may not be possible within the deadline he has set of a referendum before the end of 2017. Any attempt to change EU laws on free movement would meet fierce resistance from some EU nations, particularly Eastern European states. Mr Juncker has said free movement is non-negotiable.Mr Cameron may find it difficult to get unanimous support for his proposals for a four-year waiting period for migrant workers claiming UK benefits. East European EU members would be likely to oppose this, on the grounds that it would discriminate against their citizens.  Attempts to secure opt-outs for the City are unlikely to go down well with other European leaders.However, there are precedents for EU treaty changes to accommodate some countries' specific concerns - for example, the protocol attached to the Lisbon Treaty for Ireland.Mr Cameron has faced repeated calls to say whether he would campaign for Britain's exit from the EU in the referendum if he fails to get what he wants from the renegotiation process. All he has said is that he will ""rule nothing out"". Some Conservative MPs want Britain to leave the EU no matter what David Cameron manages to renegotiate. A larger group are likely to want more concessions than Mr Cameron has so far indicated he is prepared to demand.Senior backbencher David Davis, who was defeated by Mr Cameron for the Tory leadership in 2005, told the Daily Telegraph the majority of the 332 Conservative MPs want Mr Cameron to negotiate an ""opt-out"" power to stop individual EU laws from applying to Britain. The prime minister has said this would be ""impossible"" without Britain leaving the EU.Mr Davis claims as many as 60 Tory MPs would be prepared to rebel and vote for Britain's exit from the EU if the prime minister fails to deliver.Graham Brady, chairman of the Tory backbench 1922 committee, which represents backbenchers, has urged David Cameron to give all Conservative MPs, including ministers, a free vote in the EU referendum.In January, Mr Cameron warned that serving cabinet ministers would have to quit the government if they wanted to campaign to leave the EU if he had secured the reforms to it he wants.In the 1975 referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Economic Community, as the EU was then called, Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson decided to suspend collective responsibility because his cabinet was split on the issue. Ministers were allowed to vote with their consciences and campaign against each other. The majority of them, including Mr Wilson, joined the Yes camp, but left-wingers, such as Tony Benn, played a leading role in the No campaign. The Yes campaign won easily with 67% of the vote."
2015-05-28,UK and the EU: Better off out or in?,https://web.archive.org//web/20150529053538/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32793642,"David Cameron has promised a referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Union by the end of 2017. Here is a summary of the key arguments for and against British membership.If Britain votes to leave the EU, it will have to negotiate a new trading relationship with what would now be a 27 member organisation, to allow British firms to sell goods and services to EU countries without being hit by excessive tariffs and other restrictions.Better off out: Britain could negotiate an ""amicable divorce"", but retain strong trading links with EU nations, say those campaigning for Britain's exit. There are several potential scenarios:Better off in: An ""amicable divorce"" is a pipe dream, pro-EU campaigners argue. France, Germany and other leading EU nations would never allow Britain a ""pick and mix"" approach to the bloc's rules. Norway and Switzerland have to abide by many EU rules without any influence over how they are formed. Negotiating a comprehensive free trade agreement could take years and have an uncertain outcome. And if Britain went for a completely clean break with the EU its exports would be subject to tariffs and would still have to meet EU production standards, harming the competitiveness of British business.The run-up to the EU referendum is likely to be dominated by competing claims about how many millions of jobs will be lost or gained by Britain's exit. All such claims come with a health warning. Coming up with a precise figure is difficult as there is no way of knowing if threats by foreign companies to scale back their operations in the UK would come to pass or, indeed, how many jobs would be created by the reshaped economy that might emerge in the wake of an exit.Better off out: There would be a jobs boom as firms are freed from EU regulations and red tape, say those arguing for an exit, with small- and medium-sized companies who don't trade with the EU benefiting the most. In its recent paper, the EU Jobs Myth, the free market Institute for Economic Affairs seeks to debunk the claim that 3-4 million jobs would be lost if Britain left. ""Jobs are associated with trade, not membership of a political union, and there is little evidence to suggest that trade would substantially fall between British businesses and European consumers in the event the UK was outside the EU,"" it argues. ""The UK labour market is incredibly dynamic, and would adapt quickly to changed relationships with the EU.""Better off in: Millions of jobs would be lost as global manufacturers moved to lower-cost EU countries. Britain's large, foreign-owned car industry would be particularly at risk. ""The attractiveness of the UK as a place to invest and do automotive business is clearly underpinned by the UK's influential membership of the EU,"" said a KPMG report on the car industry last year. The financial services sector, which employs about 2.1 million people in the UK, also has concerns about a British exit. ""The success of the UK financial services industry is to a large extent built on EU Internal Market legislation. To abandon this for some untried, unknown and unpredictable alternative would carry very significant risks,"" said global law firm Clifford Chance in a report by think tank TheCityUK last year.Much would depend on the trade deals Britain managed to negotiate with the EU and rest of the world after its exit. The best-case scenario, according to think tank Open Europe, is that the UK would be better off by 1.6% of GDP a year by 2030. That is assuming the UK carried out widespread deregulation after its exit and managed to strike favourable trade deals. The think tank adds: ""A far more realistic range is between a 0.8% permanent loss to GDP in 2030 and a 0.6% permanent gain in GDP in 2030, in scenarios where Britain mixes policy approaches"".The Centre for Economic Performance, at the London School of Economics, says the worst-case scenario is a 6.3% to 9.5% reduction in GDP, ""a loss of a similar size to that resulting from the global financial crisis of 2008/09"". The best case, according to their analysis, is a loss of 2.2% of GDP.Better off out: Britain would regain full control of its borders. UKIP wants to see a work permit system introduced, so that EU nationals would face the same visa restrictions as those from outside the EU, which it says would reduce population growth from current levels of 298,000 a year to about 50,000. This would create job opportunities for British workers and boost wages, as well as easing pressure on schools, hospitals and other public services. Better off in: Britain might have to agree to allow free movement of EU migrants as the price of being allowed access to the free market. In any case, immigration from the rest of the EU has been good for Britain's economy. The UK's growth forecasts are based, in part, on continued high levels of net migration. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility says the economy relies on migrant labour and taxes paid by immigrants to keep funding public services.The UK's net contribution to the EU, taking into account the rebate, was £11.3bn in 2013. That is more than four times what it was in 2008. It is about the same amount as the UK government spends on transport every year.Better off out: The UK would save billions in membership fees, and end the ""hidden tariff"" paid by UK taxpayers when goods are exported to the EU, caused by red tape, waste, fraud and other factors. Better off in: The UK's contribution to the EU budget is a drop in the ocean compared with the benefits to business of being in the single market. Better off out: The EU is not as important to British trade as it used to be, and continuing turmoil in the eurozone will make it even less so. Even if Britain did not manage to negotiate a free trade deal with the EU it would not be as disastrous as EU-enthusiasts claim, argues economist Roger Bootle in his book The Trouble with Europe: ""It would place the UK in the same position as the US is currently in, along with India, China and Japan, all of which manage to export to the EU relatively easily."" The UK would be free to establish bilateral trade agreements with fast-growing export markets such as China, Singapore, Brazil, Russia and India through the World Trade Organisation. Better off in: The EU is the UK's main trading partner, worth more than £400bn a year, or 52% of the total trade in goods and services. Complete withdrawal from the EU would see trade barriers erected, with car exports to the EU, for example, facing a 15% tariff and imports a tariff of 10%.  ""The idea that the UK would be freer outside the EU is based on a series of misconceptions, that a medium-sized, open economy could hold sway in an increasingly fractured trading system dominated by the US, the EU and China; that the EU makes it harder for Britain to penetrate emerging markets; and that foreign capital would be more attracted to Britain's economy if it were no longer part of the single market,"" the pro-EU Centre for European Reform said in a recent report.Better off out: The UK would remain a key part of Nato and the UN Security Council and a nuclear power, with a powerful global voice in its own right. The Eurosceptic Bruges Group wants an end to the ""discredited"" principle that Britain acts as a transatlantic bridge between the US and Europe, saying the country should make self-reliance its guiding principle.Better off in: Stripped of influence in Brussels, Berlin and Paris, Britain would find itself increasingly ignored by Washington and sidelined on big transnational issues such as the environment, security and trade. America and other allies want Britain to remain in the EU. The UK risks becoming a maverick, isolated state if it leaves.Better off out: Britain would gain full control of its own borders, with migration in and out of the country regulated solely by British law. It would be more difficult for EU citizens to move to the UK, although those already living here are unlikely to be removed. Better off in: A lot would depend on what kind of deal was reached with the other EU nations. Britons may have to apply for visas to enter EU countries and those already living there may face integration rules, such as proving they can speak the language before gaining long-term residency rights. There would also be uncertainty for many EU workers now paying taxes in the UK - what benefits, if any, would they be entitled to?Better off out: The EU has limited power over tax, which is largely a matter for national governments. The exception is VAT, which has bands agreed at the EU level. Outside the EU, the UK would potentially have more flexibility.Better off in:  ""Tax avoidance and evasion will reach crippling levels as our economy becomes increasingly wholly owned by foreign multinationals that make tax avoidance in Britain central to their business strategy,"" argued the pro-European The Observer newspaper in an editorial.Better off out: It would be a major shot in the arm for British democracy as the Westminster parliament regained its sovereignty and reconnected with voters. The country would be free from the European Arrest Warrant and other law and order measures.Better off in: Britons benefit from EU employment laws and social protections, which would be stripped away. Withdrawal from the European Arrest Warrant could mean delays for the UK in extraditing suspects from other European countries; and the UK already has some opt-outs from EU labour law, including the Working Time Directive."
2015-05-28,Claptrap,https://web.archive.org//web/20150529053538/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32913113,"Britain's Parliament has some pretty bizarre rules - as the new intake of SNP MPs found out when they were given a stern warning for clapping during the Queen's Speech debate. So why is applause banned in the Commons?You can wave your order papers, shout until you are purple in the face, hurl abuse across the Chamber, join in with frankly weird displays of mass groaning or that elongated ""hear, hear"" thing they do.But try joining your party comrades in a sincere appreciation of a point well made in the traditional way and you will have Speaker John Bercow on his feet telling you to respect the traditions of the House.At least, that's what the 56 new SNP MPs found on Wednesday, when they broke into applause to support Angus Robertson, their leader at Westminster, who was hitting back at a furious attack on the party by Labour MP Ian Austin.""May I say at the start of the Parliament,"" said Mr Bercow, ""that the convention that we do not clap in this Chamber is very, very long established and widely respected, and it would be appreciated if Members showed some respect for that convention.""They will get their speaking rights from this Chair - of that they can be assured. They will be respected, but I would invite them to show some respect for the traditions of this Chamber of the House of Commons.""But like many other things in Britain's elasticated, unwritten constitution, the no-clapping convention is there to be broken.The most famous occasion was on the 27 July, 2007 when Tony Blair gave his farewell speech to the House of Commons.With wavering voice, the outgoing Labour prime minister admitted he was not really a Commons man, but he respected the place and the ""noble"" profession of politics, and with a final thespian flourish spoke his final words to the Chamber: ""I wish everyone, friend or foe, well and that's that, the end."" A ripple of applause on the Labour benches soon spread across the floor before turning into an unprecedented cross-party standing ovation.  It was an extraordinary scene - and one the then Speaker Michael Martin did nothing to stop.John Bercow himself has not always enforced the no-clapping rule as vigorously as he did on Wednesday.When the previous government mounted a last minute attempt to oust him as Speaker, on the final day of Parliament in March this year, Tory MP and friend of the speaker Charles Walker delivered an emotional speech denouncing what he saw as the underhand tactics of then-chief whip Michael Gove.The Speaker's supporters got to their feet to give Mr Walker a standing ovation.  A clearly overcome Mr Bercow let it go.Making a noise with the hands to show appreciation or disapproval is as old as civilisation itself.In ancient Rome, clapping was part of a repertoire of gestures, including the snapping of the finger and thumb and the flapping of togas, used by audiences at public performances.In French theatre, groups of professional clappers, known as ""claques"", were hired by performers to make them appear more popular with audiences.In politics, the length of the ovation at the end of a speech is sometimes seen as a sign of how well it went down.This took on a more sinister dimension in Soviet Russia, when party leaders would give long speeches with orchestrated applause and ovations.In the book Gulag Archipelago, author Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn recalls how someone toasted Stalin at a local Communist Party conference and ""stormy applause, rising to an ovation"", broke out. The great leader was not present but the applause continued regardless. ""Palms were getting sore and raised arms were already aching... however, who would dare be the first to stop?""So why is applause normally banned in the Commons?There is certainly plenty of claptrap spoken in the House (in the traditional sense of the word, meaning something designed to elicit applause).But MPs and members of the House of Lords are encouraged to find other outlets for their approval, mainly through the shouting of ""hear, hear!"", which started life in the 17th Century as a cry of ""hear him! hear him!"".The rules are laid out in the Parliamentary etiquette bible Erskine May, which says: ""Members must not disturb a Member who is speaking by hissing, chanting, clapping, booing, exclamations or other interruption."" But it adds: ""When not uttered till the end of a sentence, the cry of 'hear, hear,' offers no interruption of the speech."" MPs are well aware of how absurd this can sound to the uninitiated.The modernisation committee, set up by Tony Blair's government in an effort to drag the Commons into the 20th Century, said new MPs found it ""incomprehensible that it is not in order to clap at the end of a speech, a practice which is commonplace in other gatherings and indeed in other Parliaments"".But the committee backed the applause ban in a 1998 report:  ""While we agree that spontaneous clapping at the end of a speech could in no way be interpreted as disturbance of the speaker, there is a danger that such a practice might be open to abuse and could lead in certain circumstances to orchestration of what would amount to standing ovations with the success or failure of a speech being judged not by its content but by the relative length of the ovation at the end.""This might not disrupt an individual speech, but would disrupt the tenor of the debate, as indeed would slow handclapping.""So it looks as if MPs will have to continue sitting on their hands. And the SNP will have to find a new way to show their appreciation."
2015-05-28,Labour's battle,https://web.archive.org//web/20150529053538/http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-32913465,"Former Militant councillor Derek Hatton is attempting to rejoin the Labour Party. But what was Militant, asks Finlo Rohrer.The battle between the Labour Party and its Militant faction was one of the biggest political controversies in British politics in the 1980s. The Militant grouping had grown out of the Revolutionary Socialist League and was widely categorised as Trotskyist. From the mid-1970s its critics claimed it pursued an ""entryist"" policy of attempting to gain key positions within the Labour Party in an effort to promote its policies - including widespread nationalisation and a large programme of public works. Its most notable success was in Liverpool where the local Labour Party - dominated by Militant members - took control of the city council in 1983. Despite being only deputy leader, former firefighter Derek Hatton was seen as effectively in charge.""The best way to think of Militant is to think of Marxist-inspired socialists within the Labour Party,"" says Dr Peter North, author of Militant Liverpool: A City on the Edge.  Liverpool was particularly receptive to Militant's ideas because it had found itself ""on the wrong side of all the changes in global trade"", says North. A move to ""containerisation"" - increased use of shipping containers - was taking traffic away from the port. That and a partly associated decline in heavy industry were exacerbating unemployment and deprivation in the city. Militant started vehement opposition to the Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher, attempting to resist a reduction in the city's grant from central government by setting an illegal budget that allowed for more spending than there was income. ""They were in breach of Labour Party policies,"" says Peter Kilfoyle, a noted opponent of Militant who was a regional organiser for the Labour Party in the 1980s. ""They sought to go illegally against the government of the day when Labour Party policy was not to.""They were a party within a party. Their sole intention was to eat away at the Labour Party from the inside - taking away members and funding. They did it successfully."" Supporters of Militant point to the wave of building it initiated in Liverpool, replacing slum housing and improving sports and other leisure facilities. But the council did not have enough money to pay for its programme, and action by the district auditor was averted only by taking out loans. A move to apparently issue redundancy notices to every single council employee - ostensibly as a negotiating tactic - was widely criticised. Labour leader Neil Kinnock used a conference speech to attack Militant for ""the grotesque chaos of a Labour council hiring taxis to scuttle round a city handing out redundancy notices to its own workers"".In June 1986 Hatton was expelled from the Labour Party after a disciplinary hearing. A number of other politicians and activists were also thrown out. ""The decision was made to get rid of them,"" says Kilfoyle. ""They were in breach of the rules of the Labour Party.""But North argues that Militant were harshly treated. ""My view is that political parties that have a variety of attitudes within them are more democratic and healthy.""How an extreme group of left-wingers took over Liverpool City Council 30 years ago and opposed Margaret Thatcher's central government.

2015-05-28,Waning support,https://web.archive.org//web/20150529053538/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32889603,"One of the men credited with the successful election of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is urging British Indians to reconnect with the Labour Party.Manoj Ladwa, a London-based political strategist, is the founder of Indians for Labour, a platform for Indians in Britain to talk to Labour politicians and policy makers. Mr Ladwa, Mr Modi's director of communications during India's general election in 2014, says Labour needs to do more to appeal to aspirational Indian voters in the UK following its disastrous election result.A lifelong Labour supporter, Mr Ladwa says the message from Indian doorsteps during the election campaign was clear - Labour needs to re-engage with Indians in Britain. ""A lot of British Indians that I've been speaking to feel that the Labour Party did not address the aspirational vote,"" he told the BBC Asian Network, in an exclusive interview. ""What about the people in the middle classes, people that traditionally have small businesses, are professionals, that have been sympathetic to the Labour Party, and often significant tax payers.""That's a view echoed by company director Senna Atwal. Although he voted for Labour in previous elections, he said he didn't feel the party offered anything for him in 2015. ""I don't think Labour. . . has any support for businesses, and they don't think about entrepreneurial individuals. It was really evident that they were on the back foot.""It is highly likely that Labour politicians have heard this many times since 8 May, but they seem to be in a listening mood. ""We have to have the humility to recognise that the voters are always right,"" says Sadiq Khan, the Labour MP for Tooting in South London, who is seeking the party's nomination to be London mayor.""We've got to ask ourselves the questions, to learn the lesson of that defeat and win back the trust and confidence of people who in the past have voted Labour, but now are not.""British Asian voters have traditionally been Labour supporters, but in a BBC Asian Network/ICM poll before the election nearly 25% were undecided about which party to support and 39% said they may change their minds.  A poll for think tank British Future conducted after the election suggests the Conservatives are gaining a greater share of the ethnic minority vote. In 2010, Labour had 68% of the ethnic minority vote, compared with the Conservatives' 16%. In 2015, Labour was still in the lead at 52%, but the Conservatives managed to get a third of ethnic minority votes, with the biggest leap amongst British Asians.  Nearly half of Hindus and Sikhs questioned for the Survation survey - in which more than 2,000 people took part - said they voted Conservative. This compared with 25% of Muslims.If these results were extrapolated across the estimated three million ethnic minority voters in the UK as a whole, the think tank said it would equate to 1.6 million votes for Labour and a million for the Conservatives - the Tories' largest ever figure. Dr Maria Sobolewska, a lecturer in politics at the University of Manchester, says Labour should be focusing on retaining all ethnic minority voters, rather than concentrating on Indian voters. ""We know that their emotional attachment to the party is getting weaker and weaker,"" she says.""At every single election, we see fewer of them identifying as Labour Party supporters, so it's not just the Indians, even though the Indians are the ones who seem to be going the fastest.""Whether the Labour Party and its politicians are able to translate new aspirational policies to attract Indian voters remains to be seen.  The party's desire to reset its appeal to entrepreneurs and middle class voters is a work in progress and Sadiq Khan says they have a lot of work to do before the next election in 2020. ""We've got to be going far more door to door, temple to temple, mosque to mosque to mosque, gurdwara to gurdwara,"" he says. ""We've got to get away from this 'gatekeeper' politics. Lazy politicians of all parties have relied upon community elders to pass the message to them (voters). We've got to move on from that.""Manoj Ladwa hopes to reiterate this message through Indians for Labour, not just to reconnect voters with the party, but because he thinks Indians in Britain have a crucial role to play economically and culturally. ""There are 1.5 million Indians in this country and India as a country is now emerging as a great economic superpower. Therefore Indians in this country will play a very important role as bridge builders between the UK and India.""You can hear more on Asian Network Reports at 13:00 and 17:00, BBC Asian Network Thursday 28 May."
2015-05-28,Whistle-stop tour,https://web.archive.org//web/20150529053538/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-32912526,"Policy makers in Brussels tell me they hope David Cameron is in a listening mood as he flies around Europe over the next few weeks. He has a delicate, unenviable and complex dance routine to assimilate right now, weaving his way between Eurosceptics at home and the desires and red lines of other EU leaders.He needs their support to get reform passed.  On the prime minister's travels, he'll come across a widespread appetite for change.Finland has just appointed a well-known Eurosceptic as its foreign and Europe minister, for example. Few believe the EU is working properly for its half a billion citizens right now.  But the changes called for elsewhere in Europe won't always be the ones David Cameron may have in mind. Germany applauds a call for less red tape and more single market, but will block any call to stop the freedom of movement.Poland will fight to the last the idea of cutting benefits for migrants. This is just the start of a long process. Real negotiations (read: wheeling, dealing and behind-the-scenes pact-making) can only begin after the prime minister formally presents his wish-list for reform. That's expected at the next EU leaders' summit late next month. In the meantime, David Cameron's hand will be much strengthened if he knows the positions of other EU countries. An influential figure in Brussels on Wednesday put it to me like this: when it comes to reform, of course EU institutions like the European Commission have a role to play, but it begins with EU country leaders and it ends with them too. The prime minister and a number of his cabinet ministers burned quite a few EU bridges in the long run-up to the general election.It was felt they played too much to the Eurosceptic gallery at home when abroad on EU business. The swagger with which Chancellor George Osborne pitched up to the first EU meeting following the UK elections didn't go down well, as he brashly announced that Britain would be changing the EU, also for the benefit of other EU citizens.   German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier recently muttered that he hoped, in the run-up to the referendum, that ""there is a debate in Britain that also respects how far Europe can go to meet it"".  EU leaders want to feel that the UK sees this initially as a discussion. A process, not a diktat.And this is why tone and attitude is as important as the content of UK concerns in this pre-negotiation period.  It seems as if the government has clocked this.This morning, on the BBC's Today programme, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond struck a very different note, when discussing EU reform and the need to work with partners abroad, to the strident Eurosceptic comments he espoused before the 7 May election.UK diplomats are known for their keen negotiating skills. Britain is known to often get a ""special deal"" in EU affairs. Take the UK rebate, for example, when it comes to contributing to the EU budget.But if you want to see clear evidence of how fundamental mood music is, look no further than Greece and the eurozone misery the government there finds itself in. When Syriza won the parliamentary elections back in January there was a lot of goodwill in the eurozone - sympathy for the fact that unadulterated, harsh austerity just wasn't working.But then Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis and co marched on to the EU stage announcing Greece would tear up all existing bailout agreements, threatening the most powerful EU player, Germany, while Greek media compared Germany's leaders to Nazis.Then, hey presto, the door of goodwill and flexibility was slammed firmly in Syriza's face. However brutal the domestic debate about the EU becomes, David Cameron is well-advised to remember that his European counterparts are key to his ability to present fundamental reforms to the British public ahead of the EU referendum - or not."
2015-05-28,Analysis,https://web.archive.org//web/20150529053538/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32896924,"This was the speech David Cameron fully expected the monarch to make. But under different circumstances.While he always thought a Conservative majority was possible, the pre-election polls pointed to a minority government.If that happened, today would have been a moment of high drama - would the combined forces of Labour and the SNP vote down the Queen's Speech? Would measures have to be withdrawn or would a new, Labour-led minority administration take over?Well, in the end, the voters and not the politicians delivered their verdict and while his working majority is small, just a few weeks ago when David Cameron said the polls had caused him stomach ulcers, he would have settled for this outcome.He is in the driving seat, and has had to park relatively few of his plans.Journalists have been deprived of the tension of a tight vote and the spectacle of a government teetering on the brink -  but that doesn't mean the first Queen's Speech by a Conservative government in nearly two decades was a damp squib.There were bills which immediately highlighted their freedom from Lib Dem shackles.Measures on welfare reform almost certainly wouldn't have been proposed in this form had there been a second coalition.The main rates of working-age benefits - including tax credits and child benefit - are to be frozen until 2017, the benefit cap is to be lowered, and entitlement to housing support for young adults is to be withdrawn.If the Lib Dems had signed up to this, they would have insisted on the withdrawal of some benefits from wealthy pensioners too and pushed for their ""mansions tax"" on high value properties -  but those measures are absent from the Queen's Speech. Similarly, further legislation to limit strike action would have been absent if Vince Cable had still been at the Business Department. But having swept aside their former coalition partners, politically the Conservatives are focussed on consolidating any ground taken from Labour.So their welfare reforms are encased in a bill entitled 'Full Employment and Welfare Benefits' - with a commitment to monitoring progress towards achieving full employment and providing more apprenticeships.The political message is clear - that the government will help ""working people"" but not those claiming benefits who, in the words if the prime minister, are ""sitting at home"". The Conservatives' own polling highlighted that this was a powerful message especially in the Midlands and southern marginals seized from, or defended from, Labour.The intention is to try to recreate the coalition, not with the Lib Dems, but with people who don't traditionally back the Conservatives, but whose parents may well have voted for Mrs Thatcher before deserting the party for Tony Blair.The prime minister is even using the language of 'One Nation' - briefly favoured by Ed Miliband.So there are measures to extend free child care, and the right to buy to housing association tenants, and to ensure those who work thirty hours a week for the minimum wage won't pay income tax.But it's also interesting to note what isn't in the Queen's Speech.Labour warned that VAT would have to rise. There will now be a bill to freeze the rate until the end of the parliament. There were warnings from the opposition, too, that child benefit might be cut further, or limited to the first two children. There is no mention of this. But some of the detail of the welfare cuts may not become apparent until the Chancellor delivers a fully Conservative Budget in just over a month's time.But in some areas, the drama is merely postponed, not defused.The government ensured that the Queen didn't just make mention of the referendum bill that might have kept some seats secure from UKIP - but that there would be ""early legislation"". So straight away the government are seen to deliver on an election promise - but the prime minister is also giving himself the option of holding the vote earlier than his deadline of the end of 2017.He has united the Conservatives in calling a referendum, but whenever it takes place, the divisions in his own party will become apparent. Inevitably some of his own MPs will denounce what has been re-negotiated as inadequate and call for a No vote.And the wafer-thin nature of David Cameron's majority has already become apparent. The manifesto commitment to scrap the Human Rights Act in favour of a new British Bill of Rights did rate a mention in the Queen's Speech.But while in most areas the monarch talked about ""legislation"" or ""measures"" being introduced, on the British Bill of Rights she merely mentioned 'proposals.' So further consultation is likely.The former frontbencher David Davis has taken this is a signal that the measure will be sidelined and said that it was right to ""listen about the folly of abolishing the human rights act in the 800th year of Magna Carta"".Already it would appear that a box marked ""difficult"" is on the PM's Downing Street desk, and this has been pushed inside.And there is likely to be trouble ahead, too, in passing the forthcoming Scotland Bill which the government wants on the statute books before the Holyrood elections in a year's time.Never before have so many SNP MPs occupied the green benches at Westminster and they intend to make their presence felt. So while the Queen read out the government's commitment to ""devolving wide ranging powers to Scotland"" and to work with devolved administrations ""on the basis of mutual respect"", the Scottish Nationalists will push for more  - and argue that English-based MPs should not determine the scope of the Scottish Parliament's remit.The government will also press ahead with plans to deliver English votes for English laws through amending the standing orders of Parliament rather than, for example, through a symbolic ""England Bill"". Some of the prime minister's backbenchers are likely to feel that these measures won't go far enough.But while much of the next two years will involve arguments around the constitution - from EU membership to human rights to the powers of the Scottish parliament and Welsh and Northern Irish assemblies - make no mistake that there is a majority for much of what is in the Queen's Speech.If David Cameron maintains that majority for the next few years, Britain will be transformed in ways which are likely to be controversial. The size of the state will reduce. Working age benefits will be less generous. The deficit will be eliminated. And, if successful, the idea of a 'Northern Powerhouse' will help re-balance the economy away from the south-east.The last Labour leader had hoped he would be in a position to defeat David Cameron's Queen's Speech today. The interim leader Harriet Harman didn't engage in any small talk with the prime minister as she walked alongside him to the House of Lords to hear what the monarch had to say.But she will know the next Labour leader will have to decide how much of this agenda to accept and how much to oppose. But he or she will also have the challenge of creating distinctive policies to appeal to the ""working people"" the Conservatives have in their sights."
2015-05-28,Data law,https://web.archive.org//web/20150529053538/http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-32900604,"Overdue modernisation of the way the authorities monitor criminals and terrorists - or a Snooper's Charter eroding our basic liberties? The proposal outlined in the Queen's Speech to ""modernise the law on communications data"" will divide opinion. But prepare for another long battle over the way that law is framed and the balance it strikes between privacy and public safety.The row over forcing internet service providers (ISPs) to hold on to far more data about their users' online activities has stretched over three parliaments. The idea first came up under the last Labour government, when it was quashed by Conservative and Liberal Democrat opposition. Then it was resurrected by the Coalition, with Theresa May's plans - immediately dubbed the Snooper's Charter - blocked by her Liberal Democrat partners.Now we have in the Queen's Speech what looks like a much wider proposal for a new Investigatory Powers Bill. The government says this will ""provide the police and intelligence agencies with the tools to keep you and your family safe"", will ""maintain the ability of our intelligence agencies to target the online communications of terrorists"", and will ""cover all investigatory powers including communications data, where the government has long maintained that the gap in capabilities are putting lives at risk"".So it is both sweeping and vague, promising to give the authorities the tools they need to track criminals in a complex online world without specifying as yet how far they will be allowed to go.The Open Rights Group (ORG), which campaigns against increased surveillance, is convinced this is the return of the so-called Snooper's Charter, with increased powers of data collection and retention aimed at the entire population, coupled with attacks on encryption.The ORG's executive director Jim Killock thinks the bill will have two aims - codifying existing practices by the intelligence agencies uncovered by Edward Snowden and expanding data retention by ISPs. But he believes that the increasing use of encryption by the likes of Google and Facebook means that ordering ISPs to store their customers' data won't be enough: ""There's going to be a very interesting discussion about whether government can break encryption or order companies to break it.""Those at the sharp end - the ISPs - are more circumspect in their response to the government's plans. Their trade body ISPA put out a statement welcoming the fact that the government had promised to factor in the independent Anderson review of the laws on intercepting communications data. But it warned of the need to ""properly balance security, privacy, costs to industry and to preserve the UK's reputation as a leading place to do business online"".  The ISPs also suspect that plans to attack encryption could be on the agenda. The government has a clear election mandate, and is under pressure from the police and intelligence agencies to give them more capabilities in their online battles. But the opposition to its plans - if they do involve cracking the codes that keep online communication secret - will be intense. And it is likely to come not so much from opposition politicians, but from the global technology giants. "

After talks with David Cameron, the German leader said her ""clear-cut"" view was that the UK should stay in the EU.While there was already ""common ground"" across many areas, she said progress on welfare would be ""more protracted"". The British prime minister said there was no ""magic"" solution to reform but ""where there's a will there's a way"".The PM, who is on a whistle-stop tour of Europe trying to gather support for changes he wants before holding the UK's EU membership referendum, also repeated his call for Fifa boss Sepp Blatter to stand down as soon as possible.Speaking at a press conference after their talks in Berlin, Mrs Merkel said the two leaders had begun to talk about ""specific issues"" of future reform after Mr Cameron's general election victory.She told journalists that Germany and other EU countries had ""red lines"" - such as upholding the principle of freedom of movement - but that she hoped as far as possible to accommodate the UK's demands.""Where there is a desire there is a way,"" she said. ""That should be our guiding principle.""She added: ""We would like to be a part of the process that is going on in Great Britain at the moment and we would like to be a constructive partner in this process.Mr Cameron repeated his belief that the changes could only be achieved through treaty change, a move opposed by some European countries, including France, but he said what mattered was the ""substance"" of the reforms not the method by which they would be achieved.""This is about starting the process,"" he said of the talks. ""Of course it is going to be difficult but the important thing is to get it under way.""On the prospect of treaty change, Mrs Merkel said: ""If we're convinced of the substance we shouldn't say it's impossible to change the treaty. We should concentrate on the substance, not too much on formalities.""The UK prime minister, who earlier concluded a brief visit to Poland, has not set out in full detail the reforms he is pushing for but they will include tougher rules to prevent migrants claiming benefits.He also wants safeguards to protect the City of London in the event of closer eurozone integration and an exemption for Britain from the EU drive for ""ever closer union"". Securing the backing of Ms Merkel, who leads Europe's largest economy, will be crucial to Mr Cameron's hopes of presenting a package reforms to voters ahead of the UK's in/out referendum, which will take place before the end of 2017.After Mr Cameron's breakfast meeting with Polish Prime Minister Ewa Kopacz, Downing Street said the UK and Poland agreed on the need for more powers for national parliaments and for countries outside the eurozone to be treated fairly in the event of closer integration within the single currency bloc. ""On immigration and welfare, Prime Minister Kopacz welcomed the prime minister's commitment to respect the principle of free movement,"" a No 10 spokesman added. ""They agreed that there were issues concerning the interaction between free movement and national welfare systems that should be discussed further.""Speaking ahead of the visit Rafal Trzaskowski, Poland's Minister for European Affairs, told the BBC they would listen but that any treaty change or attempt to restrict access to benefits for EU migrants would be difficult.""As far as treaty changes are concerned or the introduction of discriminatory measures, that would be a red line for Poland.""He added: ""If every country comes with a shopping list to change European Union policies, that will be the end of the European construction, it will simply implode.""The UKIP Independence Party, which wants the UK to leave the European Union, said David Cameron's promised referendum on the UK's future in Europe - due by the end of 2017 - was about who governs the country rather than the details of benefits policy.""David Cameron is trying to make the UK's relationship with the European Union simply a question of migrant access to benefits,"" said its leader Nigel Farage. ""In reality, this is a marginal detail of a far bigger problem - both with mass inward migration putting pressure on wages and causing huge problems in the provision of public services and housing and also in the broader sense of our relationship with an out of date, sclerotic, over-regulated bloc.""David Cameron is starting renegotiation of the terms of Britain's EU membership ahead of a referendum.

Andy Burnham said wealth creators were ""heroes"" and should be valued by Labour in the same way as teachers and nurses.Yvette Cooper urged Labour to focus on the jobs of the future and not get marooned in an ""analogue"" past.And Liz Kendall warned against ""taking the safe option"", saying investment in education was key to social mobility.All those hoping to succeed Mr Miliband are arguing the party must broaden its appeal and rethink its relationship with business.With nominations set to close on 15 June, the trio - as well as other candidate Mary Creagh - are seeking to build momentum and ensure that they have the backing of 35 MPs needed to get on the ballot paper.Addressing workers at Ernst & Young in London, Mr Burnham said Labour could not win a general election without business support.The party, he said, could only regain trust if it supports those who ""put in the hours, the sweat and the hard graft"" to succeed and not allow itself to be characterised as a party of welfare and high public spending. ""I have never believed in levelling down, denigrating success or the politics of envy,"" he said. ""Nor have I believed that people should be handed everything on a plate.""It worries me that, in some people's eyes, Labour has become associated with giving people who don't want to help themselves an easy ride. That must change before we can win again.""Under his leadership, Mr Burnham said society's wealth-creators will be valued as highly as NHS staff.""Far too rarely over the last few years has Labour spoken up in praise of the everyday heroes of our society. The small businessman or woman; the sole trader; the innovator, the inventor, the entrepreneur. The small businesses that become big businesses.""The people with the creative spark to think of a new idea and the get-up-and-go to make it work. Who often have to fight against the odds to succeed, but put in the hours, the sweat and the hard graft to do it. ""So I want this message to go out loud and clear today: in a Labour Party I lead, they will be as much our heroes as the nurse or the teacher.""Mr Burnham acknowledged Labour's appeal was ""too narrow"" under Ed Miliband but challenged those who say it should merely focus on middle-income voters in the south of England as a route back to power. ""Politicians make a terrible mistake when they try to compartmentalise the voters and speak only to the hope and dreams of some in certain parts of the country,"" he added.""Aspiration is not the preserve of those who shop at John Lewis. Aspiration is universal; it is felt by Asda and Aldi shoppers too.""Ahead of the official launch of her campaign in Yorkshire later, shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper has said she will set out on a ""listening tour"" across the UK to hear what people think Labour needs to do next. Speaking at tech City in London, she said the contest was in danger of getting ""stuck in the rhetoric and the battles of our party's past when it should be talking about our country's future"".Labour, she said, should be addressing the jobs of the future - incentivising new tech-start-ups outside London and taking advantage of new technology to reshape public services and move jobs not just outside London but out of the big cities too. ""Too many people are being left behind, too many women are not being included in those jobs, too many people are not getting the opportunity to be part of that,"" she said. Liz Kendall told supporters at De Montfort University in Leicestershire that increased investment in early years education was the key to tackling ""the crippling inequality that shames our nation and holds it back"".""We must end the scourge of illiteracy and innumeracy, broaden the horizons of our young people and give everyone a better chance in life,"" she said. ""Under my leadership, Labour will do just that.""And our economic credibility will be based on having a plan that starts before children are born and follows them through the ups and downs of their lives."""

Frankly, what we've seen is the ugly side of the beautiful game and he should go.  ""And the sooner that happens the better - the faster that organisation can start to rebuild its credibility, which is going to be so important because so many people around the world want to see this game properly managed, properly looked after, so we can all enjoy the World Cups of the future.""Mr Cameron, who is holding EU reform talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, said it was ""unthinkable"" that Mr Blatter should stay.He also said he would be ""guided"" by the Football Association (FA) chairman, Greg Dyke, over the question of whether the bids for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups should be opened.Mr Dyke suggested earlier that he would not rule out a boycott of the major football tournaments if Mr Blatter remains at the helm of Fifa.The Union of European Football Associations (Uefa), Europe's governing body, may consider boycotting future World Cups if Mr Blatter wins Friday's vote, according to Scottish FA chief executive Stewart Regan.Meanwhile, the SFO said it was actively assessing ""material in its possession"" relating to Fifa corruption allegations.It said it had ""made plain that it stands ready to assist ongoing international criminal investigations"".It said its probe had been ongoing for months, before Wednesday's indictments.Despite a global media and sporting storm, Fifa president Sepp Blatter is seeking re-election for a fifth term, with the only challenge coming from Jordan's Prince Ali bin al-Hussein.The vote is taking place at the Fifa World Congress meeting in Zurich, Switzerland.The SFO said it was not willing to comment further on the nature of material in its possession or current activity in this area.  It added that it had not launched a formal criminal investigation.  But it said there were two ways in which it could get involved - if the SFO opened a formal criminal investigation itself or provided ""mutual legal assistance"" to overseas law enforcement.It also says it has made plain to both US and Swiss authorities that it stands ready to assist.""There are currently international criminal investigations into allegations of corruption at Fifa. As such it would be inappropriate for the SFO to comment on the matter at this time,"" it said.In November the SFO asked for anyone with information regarding alleged corruption in the bidding for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to come forward.However, it will not now say if its current actions relate to either of the above tournaments."
2015-05-29,Legal bid to oust Carmichael as MP,https://web.archive.org//web/20150529152232/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32930488,"Campaigners have begun a legal attempt to overturn the election of the former cabinet minister Alistair Carmichael as the MP for Orkney and Shetland.The Lib Dem MP has faced calls to resign over the leak of a memo which suggested SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon wanted David Cameron as prime minister.A petition was lodged at the Court of Session in Edinburgh in the name of four islanders.They raised more than £40,000 through the internet to pay their legal costs.The petition alleges that Mr Carmichael, Scotland's only remaining Lib Dem MP, breached Section 106 of the Representation of the People Act 1983, which outlaws false statements in relation to the ""personal character or conduct"" of a candidate.Section 106 of the Representation of the People Act states that a person who ""makes or publishes any false statement of fact in relation to the candidate's personal character or conduct shall be guilty of an illegal practice, unless he can show that he had reasonable grounds for believing, and did believe, that statement to be true"".Read more here.It was presented to judge Lord Uist and will now be considered by the Election Court in what is believed to be the first case of its kind in Scotland for half a century.The court heard that the petition would focus on ""character"" rather than ""conduct"".""Today is the start of clearing the air which has become really poisonous in our islands,"" said Tim Morrison, one of the petitioners, outside the court in Edinburgh.""We would like Alistair Carmichael to stand down,"" he said, adding that it should be up to the voters of Orkney and Shetland to decide whether or not to re-elect him in a by-election.Mr Morrison and his fellow campaigners allege that the electorate was misled because Mr Carmichael lied about his knowledge of a controversial memo about the SNP leader.Last week, an official Cabinet Office inquiry found Mr Carmichael approved the leak of the memo, which was published at the start of the general election campaign on 3 April.The document, written by a civil servant in the Scotland Office, claimed Scotland's first minister told the French Ambassador to the UK that she would prefer Mr Cameron as prime minister rather than Ed Miliband.Both Ms Sturgeon and the ambassador insisted this was not the case, and the memo had contained a disclaimer that parts of the conversation may have been ""lost in translation"".The Lib Dem MP wrote to Ms Sturgeon to apologise, saying the ""publication was a serious breach of protocol and the details of that account are not correct"".At the time of the leak, Mr Carmichael had said he first heard of the memo when he was contacted by a journalist.He has since acknowledged that while he had not seen the document before it was published, he was aware of its content and agreed that it should be made public.Opponents said that if the truth about who leaked the memo had emerged during the general election campaign it could have altered the result in his constituency, where the former Secretary of State for Scotland was returned by a majority of just 817.Tim Morrison said he was a member of the Scottish National Party but insisted the action was not politically motivated.""I am here as a voter in my constituency,"" said Mr Morrison, 50, who flew from Kirkwall to Edinburgh on Friday morning and arrived at the court shortly after 15:00.""We hope this process redeems the individual and the nature of politics in one go.""There have been protests on the islands calling for Mr Carmichael to stand down but he insists he will not, saying he has apologised, forfeited his ministerial pay-off and will continue as MP.The parliamentary standards commissioner is considering whether to accept a complaint about his conduct. Police Scotland have also received a complaint."
2015-05-29,No senior black staff in the Lords,https://web.archive.org//web/20150529152232/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32932959,"There are no black or minority ethnic (BME) staff reported in the top seven pay levels of the House of Lords administration, according to data obtained by the BBC.All 89 of the most senior employees whose ethnicity has been declared are white (there are also three senior staff who have not stated this information).In contrast five out of six workers in the lowest pay grade are ethnic minorities.The Lord Speaker Baroness D'Souza, a cross-bench peer who chairs House sittings, described the data as ""disappointing"". She said she would be monitoring progress from now on.   Lord Ouseley, formerly chair of the Commission for Racial Equality, warned that the House's top positions form ""a 'no entry' area for BME employees"".The figures have been released by the House of Lords in response to a BBC Freedom of Information request about the ethnic profile of the House's own workforce, numbering nearly 600, from clerks to catering. It does not include researchers and other staff directly employed by peers themselves, or bicameral staff shared with the Commons.  The seven top pay bands range from £49,083 to £176,226 including the senior clerks and managers of administrative workers. The maximum salary in a pay range containing a declared black or ethnic minority employee is £42,686. The FOI request revealed black and minority ethnic workers are overwhelmingly concentrated in the House's lower pay bands, with over half the BME workforce employed in housekeeping, catering and retail. Five out of six workers at the lowest pay level are BME, earning between £17,135 and £17,744 a year. This is just above the annual London ""living wage"", which based on the Lords' 36 hour working week would be £17,128.80.  Overall, 13% of Lords staff have declared themselves as BME. London's working population is currently 37% BME. But in the chamber itself only 6% of peers are ethnic minority.The ethnic profile of House of Commons staff follows a similar pattern to the Lords, but is less extreme. It has just 6% BME representation in the top seven pay levels, with 40% at the catering level. The Commons launched a diversity scheme in 2012, aiming to improve minority representation at senior levels. It issues an annual report containing ethnic data of this sort.But the House of Lords has no equivalent formal published strategy with regular monitoring data.   A Lords spokesman said: ""The House values diversity in its staff and is working hard to improve its record in this area. Our record on diversity has not been good enough but is improving and will continue to do so.""The Lords administration argues that change at senior levels is slow because of the House's relatively low staff turnover rate, which is well down on the national average.The House has revamped its application process to promote equality and says it is widening access to development opportunities.But Lord Ouseley accused the House administration of recruiting and promoting from sources that are too restricted. He said: ""If it wants to achieve diversity at the middle and higher pay grades, the Lords will have to cut away from the sources which deliver more of the same and pursue avenues that would enhance the gathering of talent from a bigger and more diverse pool of talent.""It will only ever change if there is a political determination to make equality a reality, and that is not about to happen."""
2015-05-29,MEPs in new EU-US trade controversy,https://web.archive.org//web/20150529152232/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-32916750,"Euro MPs have called for transparent and public handling of trade disputes with the US, but they have softened their stance on much-criticised commercial courts.The MEP panel's report on EU-US free trade talks - called the TTIP talks - goes before the full European Parliament for a vote on 10 June.A major European consumer group, BEUC, criticised the report, as did Green and socialist MEPs.MEPs can veto an EU-US trade deal.The stakes are high in TTIP - it could create the world's biggest free trade zone, giving a much-needed boost to business on both sides of the Atlantic. The parliament's trade committee passed the package of recommendations by 28 votes to 13 on Thursday. A German Social Democrat, Bernd Lange, was the lead MEP who drafted report.The American Chamber of Commerce in the EU called the report ""a significant positive step of support towards the trade deal"" and noted the EU's ""commitment to transparency and democratic principles as key elements"". One of the most controversial aspects of TTIP is the investment rules. It remains unclear whether a foreign investor would have access to a system known as investor state dispute settlement, or ISDS. Critics say ISDS tribunals lack transparency and can give too much leverage to powerful corporations in disputes with states.The original draft of the MEPs' report said fair, non-discriminatory treatment of foreign investors ""can be achieved without the inclusion of an ISDS mechanism - such a mechanism is not necessary in TTIP given the EU's and US' developed legal systems"".However, a later amendment dropped that mention of ISDS. It called simply for investment cases to be treated ""in a transparent manner by publicly appointed, independent professional judges in public hearings"", with respect for national courts' jurisdiction.BEUC said that ""deplorably"" the MEPs ""took a very ambiguous stance"" on ISDS. ""We have yet to see any facts justifying its inclusion in an EU/US trade deal. We hope MEPs when voting in plenary will demand the exclusion of this outdated, discriminatory and unneeded mechanism.""And a leading Green MEP, Yannick Jadot, said the report ""does not reflect the ever growing concern among the public and civil society with the TTIP negotiations and their overt corporate agenda"".  But British Labour MEP David Martin praised the report's demand for ""strong protection of labour and environmental rules"" and ""bringing an end to secret investor tribunals"". The MEPs' views influence the European Commission's stance in the wide-ranging trade talks, covering issues such as food safety, data protection, trademarks and competition in transport and public procurement.

2015-05-29,Bill-by-bill: Queen's Speech,https://web.archive.org//web/20150529152232/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32898443,"The government's legislative plans for the year ahead have been unveiled in the Queen's Speech to Parliament. Here is a guide to the bills that were announced.This will pave the way for an in/out referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union. David Cameron has promised to renegotiate Britain's relationship with the 28-member bloc and put it to a public vote by 2017 at the latest. There is speculation it could be held as early as autumn 2016.This bill, as the name would suggest, is designed to achieve full employment ""and provide more people with the security of a job"". The aim is for two million more jobs and three million new apprenticeships to be created. Ministers will be required to report annually to Parliament on their progress. The legislation will also implement a planned reduction in the welfare cap - from £26,000 to £23,000, and freeze working-age benefits, tax credit and child benefit for two years. As part of the government's welfare reforms, young people will be required to ""earn or learn"", with automatic entitlement to housing benefit for 18-21-year-olds scrapped.Read more details on gov.ukThis bill will include measures to reduce regulation on small businesses in a bid to boost job creation. It will seek to cut red tape for British business by at least £10bn and, for the first time, require independent regulators to contribute to that target. In addition, it proposes to create a new Small Business Conciliation Service, to help settle disputes between small and large businesses, especially over late payment practices. The government also aims to improve the business rates system ahead of the 2017 revaluation, including by modernising the appeals system. And it proposes to introduce a cap on public sector redundancy payments. to six figures for the highest earners.This wide-ranging bill is designed to enact a series of tax pledges made by the Conservatives during the general election campaign. Specifically that there would be no rise in income tax rates, VAT or national insurance before 2020 and that ""no one working 30 hours on the minimum wage pays any income tax at all"". It will also enact a commitment to raise the threshold before which people pay income tax to £12,500 - a move ministers say will benefit 30 million people. The government says the purpose of the bill is to ""reward those who work hard and do the right thing"".A Childcare Bill will include measures to help working people ""by greatly increasing the provision of free childcare"". Under the proposals, parents in England would be entitled to 30 hours a week of free childcare for their three- and four-year-olds, for 38 weeks of the year. Currently, they are entitled to 570 hours of free early education or childcare a year, which works out as 15 hours each week over the 38-week period.Plans to support home ownership and extend the right-to-buy scheme to 1.3 million social housing tenants in England feature in a new Housing Bill. Under the plans, housing association tenants will be able to buy the homes they rent at a discount. There will also be help for first-time buyers, with 200,000 starter homes made available to under-40s at a 20% discount. Both are commitments which were included in the Conservatives' general election manifesto. The government says the bill will increase the housing supply and ensure local people have more control over planning.Measures will be introduced to ""increase energy security"" and ensure there will be ""affordable and reliable energy for businesses and families"". The government proposes to establish the Oil and Gas Authority as an independent regulator, charged with regulation of domestic oil and gas recovery. It would transfer responsibility for giving consent for any large onshore wind farms in England and Wales from Whitehall to local planning authorities.Read more details on gov.ukThe government is promising to ""control immigration"" and put ""hard-working British families first"". Its Immigration Bill is designed to support working people, clamp down on illegal immigration and protect public services. Specifically, it will include a new offence of illegal working - with police given the power to seize the wages paid to illegal workers as the ""proceeds of crime"". There are also proposals to deal with unscrupulous landlords and to evict illegal migrants more quickly, while all foreign criminals awaiting deportation will be fitted with satellite tracking tags. It will also become an offence for businesses and recruitment agencies to hire abroad without first advertising in the UK - a policy which featured prominently in Labour's election manifesto - and a new enforcement agency will be set up to tackle what the prime minister called ""the worst cases of exploitation""Read more details on gov.ukThis paves the way for powers over housing, transport, planning and policing to be devolved to England's cities as part of government plans for ""a balanced economic recovery"". Cities that want them will be able to have elected mayors. Chancellor George Osborne has said previously that Greater Manchester - which will take on the powers when electing a mayor in two years - should become a blueprint for other large cities.The government is pressing ahead with legislation that will eventually enable work to start on the £50bn HS2 high-speed rail link. Legislation which will give the government the legal powers to construct and operate the London to Birmingham first phase of HS2 is going through Parliament. If it progresses smoothly, it should receive Royal Assent around the end of 2016, with work beginning on the project in 2017, with a finishing date of 2026.Read more details on gov.ukThe government will press ahead with further Scottish devolution as part of plans to deliver ""a strong and lasting constitutional settlement"". The Scottish Parliament will be given new tax and welfare powers, under the proposals. It follows the recommendations of the Smith Commission on Scottish devolution.There will also be further devolution of powers to Wales, under the government's plans, including a new reserved powers model to clarify the division of powers between the Welsh Assembly and Parliament. The assembly will also be given more powers over energy, transport and local government elections in Wales.Continuing the devolution theme, there will be a bill to give effect to the Stormont House Agreement in Northern Ireland. It will provide for full and independent investigations into ""unsolved Troubles-related deaths"", the government says.Read more details on gov.ukLegislation to introduce a blanket ban on so-called legal highs featured in the Queen's Speech. The government says the move is to ""protect UK citizens from the risks posed by untested, unknown and potentially harmful drugs"". It would be an offence to produce, supply, offer to supply, possess, import or export psychoactive substances. The proposal was included in the Conservatives' general election manifesto.Read more details on gov.ukThis includes measures to tackle broadcasting of extremist material. The government wants to strengthen watchdog Ofcom so that it can take action against channels that transmit extremist content. The legislation will also propose the introduction of banning orders for extremist organisations who use hate speech in public places, but whose activities fall short of proscription. A new power to allow police and local authorities to close down premises used to support extremism will also feature. And employers will be able to check whether an individual is an extremist and barring them from working with children.""New legislation will modernise the law on communications data,"" the speech said. An Investigatory Powers Bill will revive plans to give intelligence agencies new tools to target communications data - branded a ""snooper's charter"" by critics. The government says it will equip the police intelligence agencies with the tools to keep people safe.The government is promising to ""improve the law"" in this area to make communities ""safer"" and to ""build confidence and improve efficiency"" in the criminal justice system. It includes plans to reform pre-charge bail in England and Wales - with an initial 28-day limit, and to ban the use of police cells for the emergency detention of mentally ill people under the Mental Health Act. There are also proposals to reform the Police Federation in England and Wales, and plans to extend police-led prosecutions and overhaul the complaints system. Measures to beef up child protection also feature.Read more details on gov.ukThe main elements of the Bill are a 50% voting threshold for union strike ballot turnouts, and a requirement that 40% of those entitled to vote must back action in essential public services - health, education, fire and transport. Time limits will also be introduced on a mandate following a ballot for industrial action. The government says the aim is to ensure that strikes are the result of ""clear, positive and recent decisions"" by union members as well as ensuring that disruption to essential public services has a democratic mandate. There will also be the introduction of ""a transparent opt-in process for the political fund element of trade union subscriptions"", along the lines of the Northern Ireland system. Read more details on gov.ukThis bill is designed to raise standards in schools. Under the plans, new powers would be brought forward to speed up the process of changing a failing school's leadership and turning it into an academy. Those considered to be ""coasting"" - not performing as well as they could be - would also face being taken over. The bill will also give the education secretary new powers to force local councils to hand over their responsibilities for adoption to another authority or agency.This bill is designed to continue in force the legislation governing the Armed Forces. It would also make provision for other defence matters. Read more details on gov.ukThis piece of legislation is designed to ""further strengthen"" the governance and accountability of the Bank of England, according to the government. It will include measures working towards aligning monetary policy, macro prudential policy and micro prudential regulation. Read more details on gov.ukMeasures to protect charities from abuse and to strengthen the powers of the Charity Commission for England and Wales feature in this bill. It is also designed to enable charities to more easily undertake social investments. Read more details on gov.ukThe speech set out plans for legislation to scrap the current 15-year time limit on UK citizens living abroad voting in Westminster and European elections. The government says it would make it easier for overseas electors to cast their votes in time to be counted, and encourage larger numbers of British citizens living abroad to register to vote in UK elections. Read more details on gov.ukThe purpose of this bill is to give UK approval to the financing aspect of the seven year EU Budget deal agreed in 2013, which saw a real-terms cut in EU spending. It would preserve the UK's rebate, and prevent new EU-wide taxes to finance EU spending, the government says. Read more details on gov.ukThis bill would provide the option for combined authority areas with directly-elected mayors to be responsible for the running of their local bus services. The government says the move would allow cities to promote an integrated transport system. Read more details on gov.ukThis is the one draft bill to feature in the Queen's Speech. It proposed to reform and modernise the Public Service Ombudsman sector to provide ""a more effective and accessible final tier of complaints redress within the public sector"". It would absorb the functions of the Parliamentary Ombudsman, the Health Ombudsman, and the Local Government Ombudsman and potentially the Housing Ombudsman.Although it appears in the Queen's Speech, there is no legislation, either in full or draft form, on a British Bill of Rights. Instead, ministers will consult on the pros of replacing the Human Rights Act with a new legal framework of rights and responsibilities. There is no mention of any plan to repeal the ban on hunting of wild mammals with hounds, in force since 2005. Ministers have suggested MPs will be given an opportunity to decide on the matter by 2020, and will be given a free vote. "

He said he had spoken to half the Labour 80 candidates standing in Tory seats targeted by the party and other MPs before making his announcement. However, three days later Mr Umunna withdrew from the leadership contest. He said in a statement posted on his Twitter feed that had been uncomfortable with the level of ""sheer pressure"" and scrutiny that came with being a candidate.The 36-year-old added that it had perhaps been ""too soon"" for him to launch a leadership bid.Another rising star of the 2010 intake, the MP for Leeds West was appointed shadow chief secretary to the Treasury in 2011 and shadow work and pensions secretary in 2013.During the election campaign, she attacked the so-called bedroom tax, whereby housing benefit payments are reduced for tenants in council and social housing deemed to have spare rooms.However, she also suggested Labour would consider reducing the overall welfare cap in some areas.She told BBC News Labour needs ""to be in the centre ground to win a general election"" but ruled herself out of a leadership bid.A former home secretary and shadow chancellor, Alan Johnson is the Labour leadership candidate who never quite was.The popular MP declined to stand in 2010 and stepped down from his shadow cabinet role in 2011 for personal reasons.Earlier this year it was reported that senior New Labour figures Lord Mandelson and Alistair Campbell approached Mr Johnson over a leadership bid, although all three later distanced themselves from the story.But the former postman, who has been MP for Hull West and Hessle since 1997, had seemingly ruled himself out again, saying it is a ""10-year job"" and he does not have the ""right qualities"". Former army officer Dan Jarvis was elected MP for Barnsley Central in a by-election in 2011, having resigned his commission as a major in the Parachute Regiment to contest the seat.He held onto his seat at the general election, taking time out from campaigning to run the London Marathon last month.After entering Parliament in 2010, he quickly became a shadow culture, media and sport minister and later a shadow justice minister.In 2011, Mr Jarvis became the first serving politician in more than 60 years to be awarded a military honour, when he was made an MBE for his services to the armed forces.He has been touted by some colleagues as a future Labour leader but Mr Jarvis, who was widowed in 2010 and has a young family, ruled himself out, saying it is not the ""right time"" for him and his family. Historian and journalist Tristram Hunt entered Parliament in 2010 as Labour MP for Stoke-on-Trent Central.Ed Miliband made him shadow education secretary in 2013 and he has been a fierce critic of the coalition's education policies in England.Speaking in the aftermath of the election results, he called on Labour's ruling National Executive Committee ""not to rush our election"", saying there was time for a ""brutal post-mortem"" about Labour's ""underlying philosophy and thinking"".As for his own ambitions, he said ""it's about the lyrics as much as the lead singer I think"".He later said he was not confident of getting enough nominations to stand, and would support Liz Kendall.The MP for Rochdale says the deputy leader vacancy has ""come a bit too soon"" for him.He previously said a number of colleagues had asked him to put his name forward for the role.Mr Danczuk is well known for his prominent campaigning against child sex abuse and leading calls for an inquiry into allegations of historical child sex abuse by senior figures at Westminster.He was a vocal critic of Ed Miliband and in an article for the Daily Telegraph on Thursday he said Labour needed to ""step out if its Metropolitan comfort zone"" and ""reach out to the country once more.""The former director of public prosecutions has only just become an MP after being elected in Frank Dobson's old seat of Holborn and St Pancras, in North London at the general election.He was forced to rule himself out of the race to be Labour leader following a social media campaign urging him to stand.He said he was ""flattered"" by the campaign but the party needed someone with ""more political experience"".The older brother of ex-leader Ed, David Miliband was frontrunner to replace Gordon Brown in 2010, until his sibling beat him by a whisker.A former foreign secretary and MP for South Shields, he was the Blairite choice for leader but eventually quit Parliament to become head of the International Rescue Committee charity in New York in 2013.Speaking to the BBC from the US on the Monday after the general election, Mr Miliband criticised his brother's campaign in the 2015 general election, saying he and Mr Brown had ""allowed themselves to be portrayed as moving backwards from the principles of aspiration and inclusion that are the absolute heart of any successful progressive political project"".While he acknowledged the two men were ""brothers for life"", he also confirmed he was not eligible to stand for the party leadership as he is not an MP.Labour's election rulesMPs wishing to stand as leader and deputy leader have to be nominated by 15% of their colleagues in the Parliamentary Labour Party to be eligible to stand.As Labour now has 232 MPs, this means prospective candidates must get at least 34 signatures. That means the maximum size of any field is six contenders.Under rules agreed last year, all Labour Party members, registered supporters and affiliated supporters - including union members - will be allowed a maximum of one vote each on a one member, one vote system. When the election is held, they will be asked to rank candidates in order of preference.If no candidate gets 50% of all votes cast, the votes will be added up and the candidate with the fewest votes eliminated. Their 2nd preference votes will then be redistributed until one candidate has 50% of all votes cast."

2015-05-29,Round-up: BBC experts' analysis,https://web.archive.org//web/20150529152232/http://www.bbc.com/news/election-2015-32650417,"The political future of the United Kingdom has become clearer after the results of the general election emerged around the country.David Cameron says he hopes to govern for all of the UK after the Conservatives took 331 seats - enough to form a slender majority in the Commons.Labour has been all but wiped out by the SNP in Scotland and suffered a disappointing set of results elsewhere, while the Lib Dems are left with just eight MPs after many party heavyweights such as Vince Cable and Danny Alexander lost their seats.So with battles won and lost and the fall-out and celebrations beginning, BBC correspondents examine the implications and challenges that lie ahead for the new government - and for those whose political careers have been ended by voters.No pollster, no pundit, no political leader saw it coming - not even David Cameron himself.Governing parties don't gain seats. Parties that have implemented painful cuts and are promising more certainly don't. Until that is the Conservative Party did - achieving what had seemed to be Mission Impossible - a Tory majority.Until that is David Cameron's personal triumph which triggered the near simultaneous resignation of his three principle opponents - Messrs Miliband, Clegg and Farage.They did so in part because they helped to crush their partners in coalition these last five years - reducing the Liberal Democrat parliamentary party to a size when it can fit into two London taxis and still have two seats to spare.In part because the extraordinary tidal wave of support for the SNP swept dozens of once safe Labour seats away.In part because Nigel Farage persuaded millions to vote for him but secured just one seat - not, though, the one he was standing in.Read more from Nick Robinson hereThe question uppermost in the prime minister's mind as he assembles his new government is how to keep the kingdom united.""Above all I want to bring our country together,"" he revealed after the result, ""to reclaim a mantle we should never have lost - the mantle of one nation, one United Kingdom"".Looking at the political landscape from Land's End today is very different to the view from John O'Groats.A sea of Conservative and Unionist blue dominates the scene across much of England, while a field of SNP nationalist yellow stretches to the horizon and beyond from the north.David Cameron's greatest challenge is to prevent the union he supports being torn apart by mutual resentment - resentment from Scotland at a Westminster government dominated by English Tories, and resentment from England at the preferential treatment people think is being given to the Scots.Those who assumed the future of the Union had been safeguarded by the Scottish referendum must think again.Read more from Mark Easton hereOne thing is rock-solid true: the Conservatives who worked on this campaign are as surprised by the result as the pollsters, pundits, politicians and general population.Maybe they shouldn't be - the economy is in good shape and the Conservatives had incumbency advantage.But when I travelled back from the prime minister's last rally with a group of exhausted Conservative campaign officials it was clear that 290 seats was a hoped-for target.No-one talked about anything over 300 seats, and no-one even mentioned an overall majority.So what special sauce pushed David Cameron into No 10 with a Commons majority?Mr Cameron had two simple messages in the campaign and he rarely veered away from them; the first - the economy is in good shape and the recovery is threatened by Labour. And the second - the SNP would hold a Labour-led government to ransom.Read more from Jonny Dymond hereBrian Taylor, BBC political editor, ScotlandOf all the comments on the overnight apocalypse, undoubtedly the most straightforward came from a defeated Scottish Labour MP.Since there were quite a few of them, let me narrow the focus a little. Come on down, Tom Harris.Mr Harris had plainly anticipated defeat. Nonetheless, he looked suitably lugubrious as his fate was confirmed.Why, he was asked eagerly, had Labour lost? ""Because we did not win enough votes.""Psephologically, it is perfect. Complete in itself. Psychologically, it sums up Labour's gloom without descending into subsidiary matters such as leadership, strategy and the rest. As a forward-thinking strategy, it is ideal. Win more votes. Simple.Read more from Brian Taylor hereThis has been an election which may have more profound consequences than almost any in living memory.We now face a generational decision about our future in Europe, with an EU referendum in two years' time almost certain.There will also be serious questions about the future of the Union, following an SNP landslide that has turned Scotland into a virtual one-party state.David Cameron's victory also represents a colossal achievement.Only once before in recent history has an incumbent government increased its majority - and that was Mrs Thatcher in her prime in the 1980s.It is also a significant personal victory for Mr Cameron and a rebuff for those in his party who had become increasingly sceptical about his ability to win.But while it may represent a defeat for those Tories who saw this election as a potential opportunity to rid themselves of David Cameron, he must now govern with a wafer-thin majority.For the SNP, their stunning victory can only increase the pressure on Nicola Sturgeon to include a commitment to a second independence referendum in her party's manifesto for next year's Scottish elections.It is an election which has not just defied all the predictions of the pollsters and pundits - but which may yet prompt the most fundamental re-casting of British politics for a generation.Read more from Norman Smith hereAfter an extraordinary night, some brief conclusions:Read more from James Landale hereIs this the end of the union?That is the question many people will be asking this morning after the party which has fought for Scottish independence for 80 years swept to victory.The answer from the jubilant Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon is a firm ""No"".She insists that her MPs will speak for all of Scotland, not just for the 45% who voted for the country to leave the United Kingdom last September.In the closing hours of the most extraordinary election campaign which anyone in Scotland can remember, Ms Sturgeon turned to talk of ""legitimacy.""That will be her watchword in the coming days as she argues that the prime minister cannot ignore the democratic will of the Scottish people.Politically, Scotland and England this morning look and feel like very different countries.Read more from James Cook hereAfter weeks of chatter about an election too close to call, it wasn't that close at all.David Cameron will be continuing as our prime minister.So, what is all this likely to mean?A referendum on whether the UK stays in, or leaves, the European Union, within the next two-and-a-half years.A race to be the next leader of the Labour Party.A race to be the next leader of the Liberal Democrats.And a huge new presence of Scottish National Party MPs at Westminster.And so here's another thing we know for certain this morning: Politics ain't going to be boring any time soon.Read more from Chris Mason hereFor Labour the story of their terrible night is rapidly turning into the search for a new leader. So who will that be?Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, is almost certain to run.  Even before this election, both he and another almost inevitable candidate, Chuka Umunna, had raised eyebrows inside the party at the work they had put in, preparing the ground with members and the unions for potential bids.Yvette Cooper, before the election, was still thought not to have made up her mind over whether to run. That decision has been made perhaps a little easier as her husband, Ed Balls, has lost his seat.She is certainly potentially in the frame, along with two lesser known names - Liz Kendall and Dan Jarvis - two MPs who were only elected in 2010 for the first time. This could be their moment. But whoever is in the job, they face a monumental task.Read Laura Kuenssberg's Twitter hereSterling is up (the most for seven years against the euro), share prices are up (especially bank shares like Lloyds and RBS, and energy shares such as Centrica), government bond prices are up.To state the obvious, investors love the Tories' general election victory.There are a few reasons.One (no surprise here) is that Labour's threat of breaking up banks and imposing energy price caps has been lifted.Second is that investors have been discounting days and weeks of wrangling after polling day over who would form the government - and so they are semi-euphoric that we already know who's in charge.Third, many investors tend to be economically conservative and instinctively Conservative.But although the City may be a bit drunk on the result, its pleasure in Ed Miliband's and Ed Balls' humiliation may be making it a bit blind - perhaps dangerously so - to some bumps in the economic road ahead.Read more from Robert Peston hereNigel Farage dreamed of holding the balance of power, but in the end his UKIP party is now worse off than when it came into the election.At the seventh time of asking he was rejected - this time by the people of Thanet South. It was a similar story in Rochester and Strood where Mark Reckless, who sensationally defected from the Tories last year, was also sent packing.In seats on UKIP's target list, like Thurrock in Essex, the party failed to make gains. In Grimsby - where Mr Farage went twice in the last six weeks - they came third.UKIP got around four million votes - with especially strong showings in north-east and south-east England - but it's ended up with just one MP, and a vacancy at the top. This has led to UKIP attacking the current system of choosing MPs, which it's described as ""busted"" and ""dysfunctional"".In one sense, this campaign was a complete failure and it's left an aftermath of angry voters, and others wondering if the UKIP bubble has burst.Read Robin Brant's Twitter hereI monitored 91 GB-wide voting intention polls during the 2015 election campaign and found nothing in them to prepare me for the final outcome.The good news for the pollsters was that their share for the Lib Dems was pretty close, as were the shares for UKIP, the Greens and the catch-all category of Others.The bad news for the polling industry was that the crucial shares for Conservative and Labour were the ones where they came most adrift.When all the qualifications of margins of error are allowed, there did appear to be a systematic overstatement of the Labour share and an equally systematic understatement of the Conservative one.It is for the pollsters to decide whether to conduct a review of their performance but I trust they will avoid the initial knee-jerk reaction of the immediate aftermath of the 1992 polls debacle.This general election performance follows the performance of the polls in the 2014 Scottish referendum where the choice was simply binary and yet all the polls were out by between 4-6%.Something is wrong. A lot of us would like to know what it is.Read more from David Cowling hereThe words ""political earthquake"" have been translated into numerous European languages, making front page news across the continent.While Britons now examine the domestic minutiae of the election result, here in mainland Europe the vote means one thing: a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU. And that has the potential to create an earthquake of its own.The guardian of the EU treaties Mr Cameron wants to change - Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker - has said again he'd listen to what Britain's new government proposed.Read more from Katya Adler here"

2015-05-29,"EU referendum: What, when and why?",https://web.archive.org//web/20150529152232/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"The UK is set to have a referendum by the end of 2017 on whether or not to remain a member of the European Union.The Conservatives' election manifesto promised to hold a referendum (a nationwide vote) on whether or not the UK should stay in or leave the European Union. They won the election so it's all systems go.A referendum is basically a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part, normally giving a ""Yes"" or ""No"" answer to a question. Whichever side gets more than half of all votes cast is considered to have won.The European Union is an economic and political partnership between 28 European countries. It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, its own parliament and it now sets the rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things like mobile phone charges.The one thing we know for sure is that Prime Minister David Cameron has said it will happen by the end of 2017. The most likely times of the year for referendums are generally May or September, and some people think it should be held as soon as possible - possibly even in May 2016, to coincide with elections in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and London, rather than waiting for 2017. When David Cameron announced in January 2013 his pledge to hold a referendum, a key element was that he would seek to make changes to the way the European Union works - or at least the rules covering the UK as a European Union member. Only once this renegotiation of British membership had been completed would he put the new arrangement to the public vote.During the election the Lib Dems and Labour both said they did not want a referendum unless there were plans to transfer more powers from the UK to the EU. Labour has since dropped its opposition, so the Conservatives are expected to get their Referendum Bill passed easily. The House of Lords could delay it, but as the referendum was promised in the Conservative election manifesto (a manifesto is a document setting out what a party would do if they won the election) it is not likely to reject the bill once MPs back it.The question is always crucial in any referendum and there is already debate about what it should be. The 2013 suggestion from the Conservatives was: ""Do you think that the United Kingdom should remain a member of the European Union?"" Some people thought this phrasing leaned too far towards the status quo - the current state of affairs - and the Electoral Commission, which has to approve the question, said it was not clear enough and proposed:""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union?""Read more: Does the wording of a referendum question matter?British, Irish and Commonwealth citizens over 18 who are resident in the UK, along with UK nationals who have lived overseas for less than 15 years. Members of the House of Lords and Commonwealth citizens in Gibraltar will also be eligible, unlike in a general election. Citizens from EU countries - apart from Ireland, Malta and Cyprus - will not get a vote.Mr Cameron is not revealing the full details of what he wants from the other EU leaders ahead of negotiations - but he is expected to demand an opt-out from one of its core principles of forging an ""ever-closer union"" between member states. He will also try to get restrictions on welfare benefits - in particular, tax credits - for migrants and more powers to block or opt out of new EU laws.Read more: Q&A: What Britain wants from EuropeBritain had a referendum in 1975 shortly after it had joined the EU, or the Common Market as it was then called. The country voted to stay in then but there have been growing calls, from the public and politicians, for another vote because, they argue, the EU has changed a lot over the past 40 years, with many more countries joining and the organisation extending its control over more aspects of daily lives. David Cameron initially resisted these calls but in 2013 he changed his mind.About 33% of the British public, according to the latest opinion polls. The UK Independence Party, which won the last European elections, and received nearly four million votes, 13% of those cast, in May's general election, campaigns for Britain's exit from the EU. A fair number of Conservative MPs - and several Labour ones - are also thought to be strongly in favour of leaving.They believe Britain is being held back by the EU, which they say imposes too many rules on business and charges billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also want Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. They also object to the idea of ""ever closer union"" and the belief that the ultimate goal is to create a ""United States of Europe"".David Cameron wants Britain to stay in the EU, once he has got some powers back from it. He has so far refused to say whether he would start calling for Britain to leave if he does not get what he wants from the other EU leaders. The Labour Party, SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems are also in favour of staying in. Latest opinion polls suggest 45% of the British public agree with them.They believe Britain gets a big boost from EU membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argue, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also believe Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving.It depends which way you look at it - or what you believe is important. Leaving the EU would be a big step - arguably far more important than who wins the next general election - but would it set the nation free or condemn it to economic ruin? Here is a rundown of the arguments for and against.Big business - with a few exceptions - tends to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. The CBI president and BT chief Sir Mike Rake says there are ""no credible alternatives"" to staying in the EU. But others disagree, such as Lord Bamford, chairman of JCB, who says an EU exit would allow the UK to negotiate trade deals as our country ""rather than being one of 28 nations"". Many small- and medium-sized firms would welcome a cut in red tape and what they see as petty regulations, but a lot hangs on what deal Mr Cameron renegotiates. The British Chambers of Commerce says 55% of members back staying in a reformed EU.Find out more: Business for Britain wants big changes to the UK's relations with the EU and says the UK should be prepared to vote to leave if the changes are not achievedBusiness for New Europe is a coalition of business leaders who support the UK's membership of the EU and ""oppose withdrawal to the margins"".The Electoral Commission will be in charge of making sure it's a fair contest.  There will be official ""Yes"" and ""No"" campaigns, selected by the Commission, which will have to abide by strict spending limits. Anyone wanting to launch their own Yes or No campaign will have to register with the Commission if they plan to spend more than £10,000. They must be UK-based. The Commission says MPs should decide what kinds of organisations should be allowed to take part. Business groups, trade unions and pressure groups are all likely to want to have their say.There will also be rules to prevent organisations trying to get round the spending limits through multiple registrations. Political parties will also be allowed to campaign for the result they want to see.Anyone who runs an unregistered campaign will be limited to spending less than £10,000. The idea is to prevent wealthy foreigners, companies or governments trying to influence the outcome. The Electoral Commission has published preliminary guidelines.That is yet to be decided and will partly depend on what Mr Cameron achieves in his renegotiation of the terms of the UK's membership of the EU. He says he is confident he can get what he wants, in which case he would be expected to lead the ""staying in"" side. The highest profile supporter of leaving the EU is UKIP leader Nigel Farage, but there are likely to be other high profile politicians who support withdrawal - or, as with the anti-euro campaign a few years back, celebrities or business people could front an ""anti-politics"" campaign.Conservatives' election manifesto - including referendum pledgeTry these features:How to win a referendumWhat David Cameron wants from the EU negotiationsTimeline: Campaigns for a European Union referendumBusinesses give their views on a possible EU exit"
2015-05-29,What Britain wants from Europe,https://web.archive.org//web/20150529152232/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32695399,"David Cameron says he has a mandate to pursue EU reform following the Conservatives' general election victory. The PM, who will be hoping his majority government will give him extra leverage in Brussels, wants to renegotiate the terms of the UK's membership ahead of a referendum by the end of 2017. He has said he will campaign for Britain to remain in the EU if he gets the reforms he wants.Mr Cameron has said he does not want to reveal full details of his negotiating hand but he has given a broad indication, in a series of speeches and newspaper articles, of his priorities when he goes into talks with other EU leaders.These are: The prime minister has said Britain would resist any move towards a European Army and that he wants to free British police forces from EU interference. He has also ruled out Britain joining the euro.But he has placed less emphasis in recent years on demanding changes to EU social policy, such as the maximum 48-hour working week, agency workers, maternity leave and non-discrimination rules.The official UK government position is that a referendum will be held by the end of 2017 but Downing Street sources have said: ""If we can do it earlier we will.""There is speculation David Cameron is planning to hold the vote in 2016 to avoid a clash with French and German elections in 2017.The prime minister wants treaty change but even if the referendum was held in 2017 there may not be enough time to legally incorporate any reforms into a treaty and it would have to be done at a later stage.An early referendum would anger Eurosceptics who believe it would not allow enough time to make the case for exit or negotiate any meaningful concessions.""A rushed process would severely undermine the chances to secure a significant deal that both British business and voters could support and would waste the opportunity of a lifetime,"" Matthew Elliott, chief executive of Business for Britain told Breitbart London.The question is always crucial in any referendum and there is already a debate about what it should be. The Draft European Union (Referendum) Bill, published by the Conservatives in 2013, proposed this form of words: ""Do you think that the United Kingdom should remain a member of the European Union?""Some thought that leaned too far towards the status quo, encouraging a yes vote, and the Electoral Commission said it was not clear and direct enough. The watchdog proposed this form of words instead: ""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union?""The new Conservative government will attempt to repeal the Human Rights Act, which requires UK courts to treat the European Court of Human Rights as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. The European Court of Human Rights is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe (CoE), which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine.The freedom for people to move around Europe, enshrined in the EU treaties, works in parallel with the other three basic freedoms in the single market: freedom of goods, capital and services.It is likely to be a ""red line"" for other EU leaders, who do not want to see it eroded.Mr Cameron has steered clear of tackling it directly - for example by asking for an emergency ""brake"" on free movement, or a cap on numbers - focusing instead on reducing the incentive provided by welfare payments. In a speech last November, David Cameron set out measures to reduce the number of EU nationals moving to the UK.His main proposals were:Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission, has said he is ready to work with Mr Cameron to ""strike a fair deal for the United Kingdom in the EU"". The leaders of other EU nations have previously warned they are unlikely to support major changes to EU treaties to accommodate British demands. But Mr Cameron's general election victory may have given him extra leverage. ""The ball is very much in the court of the UK now,"" a senior EU official told The Guardian. ""It's up to the British to define what they want."" The key figure will be German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is very keen to keep Britain in the EU but has so far been unwilling to make major concessions to enable that to happen. There are fears that a ""pick and mix"" approach to EU treaties would undermine EU cohesion.Mr Cameron has said there is ""no doubt"" his planned reforms will require changes to the treaties governing the European Union. But this would require the unanimous support of all EU members, and may not be possible within the deadline he has set of a referendum before the end of 2017. Any attempt to change EU laws on free movement would meet fierce resistance from some EU nations, particularly Eastern European states. Mr Juncker has said free movement is non-negotiable.Mr Cameron may find it difficult to get unanimous support for his proposals for a four-year waiting period for migrant workers claiming UK benefits. East European EU members would be likely to oppose this, on the grounds that it would discriminate against their citizens.  Attempts to secure opt-outs for the City are unlikely to go down well with other European leaders.However, there are precedents for EU treaty changes to accommodate some countries' specific concerns - for example, the protocol attached to the Lisbon Treaty for Ireland.Mr Cameron has faced repeated calls to say whether he would campaign for Britain's exit from the EU in the referendum if he fails to get what he wants from the renegotiation process. All he has said is that he will ""rule nothing out"". Some Conservative MPs want Britain to leave the EU no matter what David Cameron manages to renegotiate. A larger group are likely to want more concessions than Mr Cameron has so far indicated he is prepared to demand.Senior backbencher David Davis, who was defeated by Mr Cameron for the Tory leadership in 2005, told the Daily Telegraph the majority of the 332 Conservative MPs want Mr Cameron to negotiate an ""opt-out"" power to stop individual EU laws from applying to Britain. The prime minister has said this would be ""impossible"" without Britain leaving the EU.Mr Davis claims as many as 60 Tory MPs would be prepared to rebel and vote for Britain's exit from the EU if the prime minister fails to deliver.Graham Brady, chairman of the Tory backbench 1922 committee, which represents backbenchers, has urged David Cameron to give all Conservative MPs, including ministers, a free vote in the EU referendum.In January, Mr Cameron warned that serving cabinet ministers would have to quit the government if they wanted to campaign to leave the EU if he had secured the reforms to it he wants.In the 1975 referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Economic Community, as the EU was then called, Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson decided to suspend collective responsibility because his cabinet was split on the issue. Ministers were allowed to vote with their consciences and campaign against each other. The majority of them, including Mr Wilson, joined the Yes camp, but left-wingers, such as Tony Benn, played a leading role in the No campaign. The Yes campaign won easily with 67% of the vote."
2015-05-29,UK and the EU: Better off out or in?,https://web.archive.org//web/20150529152232/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32793642,"David Cameron has promised a referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Union by the end of 2017. Here is a summary of the key arguments for and against British membership.If Britain votes to leave the EU, it will have to negotiate a new trading relationship with what would now be a 27 member organisation, to allow British firms to sell goods and services to EU countries without being hit by excessive tariffs and other restrictions.Better off out: Britain could negotiate an ""amicable divorce"", but retain strong trading links with EU nations, say those campaigning for Britain's exit. There are several potential scenarios:Better off in: An ""amicable divorce"" is a pipe dream, pro-EU campaigners argue. France, Germany and other leading EU nations would never allow Britain a ""pick and mix"" approach to the bloc's rules. Norway and Switzerland have to abide by many EU rules without any influence over how they are formed. Negotiating a comprehensive free trade agreement could take years and have an uncertain outcome. And if Britain went for a completely clean break with the EU its exports would be subject to tariffs and would still have to meet EU production standards, harming the competitiveness of British business.The run-up to the EU referendum is likely to be dominated by competing claims about how many millions of jobs will be lost or gained by Britain's exit. All such claims come with a health warning. Coming up with a precise figure is difficult as there is no way of knowing if threats by foreign companies to scale back their operations in the UK would come to pass or, indeed, how many jobs would be created by the reshaped economy that might emerge in the wake of an exit.Better off out: There would be a jobs boom as firms are freed from EU regulations and red tape, say those arguing for an exit, with small- and medium-sized companies who don't trade with the EU benefiting the most. In its recent paper, the EU Jobs Myth, the free market Institute for Economic Affairs seeks to debunk the claim that 3-4 million jobs would be lost if Britain left. ""Jobs are associated with trade, not membership of a political union, and there is little evidence to suggest that trade would substantially fall between British businesses and European consumers in the event the UK was outside the EU,"" it argues. ""The UK labour market is incredibly dynamic, and would adapt quickly to changed relationships with the EU.""Better off in: Millions of jobs would be lost as global manufacturers moved to lower-cost EU countries. Britain's large, foreign-owned car industry would be particularly at risk. ""The attractiveness of the UK as a place to invest and do automotive business is clearly underpinned by the UK's influential membership of the EU,"" said a KPMG report on the car industry last year. The financial services sector, which employs about 2.1 million people in the UK, also has concerns about a British exit. ""The success of the UK financial services industry is to a large extent built on EU Internal Market legislation. To abandon this for some untried, unknown and unpredictable alternative would carry very significant risks,"" said global law firm Clifford Chance in a report by think tank TheCityUK last year.Much would depend on the trade deals Britain managed to negotiate with the EU and rest of the world after its exit. The best-case scenario, according to think tank Open Europe, is that the UK would be better off by 1.6% of GDP a year by 2030. That is assuming the UK carried out widespread deregulation after its exit and managed to strike favourable trade deals. The think tank adds: ""A far more realistic range is between a 0.8% permanent loss to GDP in 2030 and a 0.6% permanent gain in GDP in 2030, in scenarios where Britain mixes policy approaches"".The Centre for Economic Performance, at the London School of Economics, says the worst-case scenario is a 6.3% to 9.5% reduction in GDP, ""a loss of a similar size to that resulting from the global financial crisis of 2008/09"". The best case, according to their analysis, is a loss of 2.2% of GDP.Better off out: Britain would regain full control of its borders. UKIP wants to see a work permit system introduced, so that EU nationals would face the same visa restrictions as those from outside the EU, which it says would reduce population growth from current levels of 298,000 a year to about 50,000. This would create job opportunities for British workers and boost wages, as well as easing pressure on schools, hospitals and other public services. Better off in: Britain might have to agree to allow free movement of EU migrants as the price of being allowed access to the free market. In any case, immigration from the rest of the EU has been good for Britain's economy. The UK's growth forecasts are based, in part, on continued high levels of net migration. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility says the economy relies on migrant labour and taxes paid by immigrants to keep funding public services.The UK's net contribution to the EU, taking into account the rebate, was £11.3bn in 2013. That is more than four times what it was in 2008. It is about the same amount as the UK government spends on transport every year.Better off out: The UK would save billions in membership fees, and end the ""hidden tariff"" paid by UK taxpayers when goods are exported to the EU, caused by red tape, waste, fraud and other factors. Better off in: The UK's contribution to the EU budget is a drop in the ocean compared with the benefits to business of being in the single market. Better off out: The EU is not as important to British trade as it used to be, and continuing turmoil in the eurozone will make it even less so. Even if Britain did not manage to negotiate a free trade deal with the EU it would not be as disastrous as EU-enthusiasts claim, argues economist Roger Bootle in his book The Trouble with Europe: ""It would place the UK in the same position as the US is currently in, along with India, China and Japan, all of which manage to export to the EU relatively easily."" The UK would be free to establish bilateral trade agreements with fast-growing export markets such as China, Singapore, Brazil, Russia and India through the World Trade Organisation. Better off in: The EU is the UK's main trading partner, worth more than £400bn a year, or 52% of the total trade in goods and services. Complete withdrawal from the EU would see trade barriers erected, with car exports to the EU, for example, facing a 15% tariff and imports a tariff of 10%.  ""The idea that the UK would be freer outside the EU is based on a series of misconceptions, that a medium-sized, open economy could hold sway in an increasingly fractured trading system dominated by the US, the EU and China; that the EU makes it harder for Britain to penetrate emerging markets; and that foreign capital would be more attracted to Britain's economy if it were no longer part of the single market,"" the pro-EU Centre for European Reform said in a recent report.Better off out: The UK would remain a key part of Nato and the UN Security Council and a nuclear power, with a powerful global voice in its own right. The Eurosceptic Bruges Group wants an end to the ""discredited"" principle that Britain acts as a transatlantic bridge between the US and Europe, saying the country should make self-reliance its guiding principle.Better off in: Stripped of influence in Brussels, Berlin and Paris, Britain would find itself increasingly ignored by Washington and sidelined on big transnational issues such as the environment, security and trade. America and other allies want Britain to remain in the EU. The UK risks becoming a maverick, isolated state if it leaves.Better off out: Britain would gain full control of its own borders, with migration in and out of the country regulated solely by British law. It would be more difficult for EU citizens to move to the UK, although those already living here are unlikely to be removed. Better off in: A lot would depend on what kind of deal was reached with the other EU nations. Britons may have to apply for visas to enter EU countries and those already living there may face integration rules, such as proving they can speak the language before gaining long-term residency rights. There would also be uncertainty for many EU workers now paying taxes in the UK - what benefits, if any, would they be entitled to?Better off out: The EU has limited power over tax, which is largely a matter for national governments. The exception is VAT, which has bands agreed at the EU level. Outside the EU, the UK would potentially have more flexibility.Better off in:  ""Tax avoidance and evasion will reach crippling levels as our economy becomes increasingly wholly owned by foreign multinationals that make tax avoidance in Britain central to their business strategy,"" argued the pro-European The Observer newspaper in an editorial.Better off out: It would be a major shot in the arm for British democracy as the Westminster parliament regained its sovereignty and reconnected with voters. The country would be free from the European Arrest Warrant and other law and order measures.Better off in: Britons benefit from EU employment laws and social protections, which would be stripped away. Withdrawal from the European Arrest Warrant could mean delays for the UK in extraditing suspects from other European countries; and the UK already has some opt-outs from EU labour law, including the Working Time Directive."
2015-05-29,Seeing eye-to-eye?,https://web.archive.org//web/20150529152232/http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-eu-32929957,"""David Cameron has to be realistic,"" said Poland's Europe Minister Rafal Trzaskowski, ""and I'm sure he will be"".It is a message Mr Cameron will hear repeated in capitals across the continent as he sets out on his campaign to renegotiate the UK's role in the European Union. After a brief breakfast meeting with his Polish counterpart Ewa Kopacz, at a former royal palace in Warsaw, the British prime minister will be in no doubt about Poland's position.Any British attempt to restrict the rights of migrant workers from other EU countries while they are in the UK will be resisted. Abuse of the welfare system is a different matter. On that issue, progress can and will be made. But suggestions that Mr Cameron might seek to prevent other EU citizens claiming in-work benefits such as tax credits are seen as unacceptable.""We can't accept discrimination,"" Mr Trzaskowski said, ""it's a red line"".There are other issues, though, on which Poland and the UK clearly see eye-to-eye. After Mr Cameron's meeting with Mrs Kopacz, a Downing Street spokesperson said: ""There was much they could agree on - making Europe more competitive by strengthening the single market, cutting back red tape, ensuring fairness between euro-ins and euro-outs and more subsidiarity, respecting the sovereignty of member states.""The Poles will welcome British efforts to guarantee that the interests of EU countries outside the eurozone are protected. The notion that national parliaments should play a more active role in assessing EU legislation will also find favour. But the big political change in Poland this week has not been in parliament but in the presidency. The conservative Andrzej Duda has - rather surprisingly - been elected president, after gaining strong support from a younger generation of voters.  Mr Duda was the candidate of the Law and Justice Party, which belongs to the same political group as the British Conservatives in the European Parliament. ""We are strongly against building an artificial European federal state,"" Jaroslaw Sellin from Law and Justice told me. ""We need to co-operate as independent countries within the EU, and the main focus should always be on the economy."" In other words there is plenty of political opinion in Poland that David Cameron can appeal to. But British renegotiation needs to be based on the idea of working together, not on dictating terms - that won't work, in Warsaw or elsewhere. David Cameron is starting renegotiation of the terms of Britain's EU membership ahead of a referendum. Here is some further reading on what it all means: What Britain wants from EuropeThe UK and the EU: Better off in or out?EU reform: What's in it for the others?"
2015-05-29,UKIP v Labour,https://web.archive.org//web/20150529152232/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32928391,"The fight between Labour and UKIP is heading to Wales. Nigel Farage's party is challenging in seats where Labour traditionally dominate at the general election, and it could be on course for electoral success there within the year.Voters in Caerphilly have always elected Labour MPs. But on 7 May this was one of 120 constituencies where UKIP came second, and soon there will be another election here on terms likely to suit Nigel Farage's party.Professor Roger Scully, of Cardiff University, tells BBC Radio 4's the World at One that at the moment UKIP are on course to win six or seven seats in the Welsh Assembly next year.The campaign here will be one of the first jobs on the to-do list of a new Labour leader, and will pose a fundamental question: what should Labour do about the threat from UKIP?The voting system for the Assembly election next year combines first-past-the-post contests and proportional representation, giving smaller parties like UKIP a much better chance than in Westminster contests.Sam Gould was UKIP's candidate in Caerphilly at the general election, winning almost a fifth of the vote, its most improved result in Wales.A former Labour voter, he has only joined UKIP in the last year. A few months ago the party had no presence in the town.Showing me around the Lansbury Park estate there, he says: ""We've only been organised as a party for a matter of three months and so for us to get to 20% of the vote after only organising ourselves and running a three month campaign is tremendous. So what can we do in a year?""There has never been a rush to vote Tory in much of south east Wales. The legacy of mines long since closed still marks the landscape, politics and cultural identity of the area. But Professor Scully says that doesn't guarantee an unchanging allegiance to the Labour party.He says: ""There was an element of the Labour vote in the South Wales valleys, an element of sort of socially conservative working class voters in much of Wales, that was unenthusiastic Labour and that was ready and waiting you might say for UKIP to come along and try to attract them.""You might think that a deeply worrying analysis for the Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones. Yet he appears far from panicked, instead suggesting other parties will suffer at UKIP's hands.He says: ""All the opinion polls seem to suggest that the seats would come from other parties not from us, bearing in mind we have 30 out of the 60 seats and 28 of them are first past the post.  ""In terms of losing seats in the proportional representation section, actually it's other parties that would lose the seats other than ourselves.""Labour's near-wipe-out in Scotland is recent, raw and devastating. It seemed unthinkable, until it happened. Wales' politics are very different; neither UKIP nor the Welsh nationalists Plaid Cymru have enjoyed an SNP-like surge. But after its Scottish trauma Labour must wonder whether the party in Wales - and its leader - accused by opponents of taking traditional support for granted and facing fresh threats, could suffer a similar fate.The Welsh First Minister says the possibility is ""always there in the forefront of our minds"".But he adds: ""We wanted to make sure that people saw us as a party that would stand up for Wales, a party that was devolutionist in its outlook while at the same time not a party that supported independence and that was the basis for our success in 2011. ""In Scotland I get the impression that Scottish Labour went the other way and left that contested ground to the SNP. It's not a mistake that we're going to make.""He suggests Labour's leaders in Scotland made errors that he has already managed to avoid. His analysis will be tested by voters in Wales next May. With Scottish and London Mayoral and Assembly elections due on the same day, it could be a moment to help demonstrate whether Labour has learned how to win back voters, or whether it has been abandoned by some of its traditional supporters for good."
2015-05-29,Legal challenge,https://web.archive.org//web/20150529152232/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-32930228,"An online appeal to raise funds for a legal challenge to the election of Orkney and Shetland MP Alistair Carmichael has raised more than £42,000 in four days.The People Versus Carmichael was launched on crowdfunding site Indiegogo by ""residents of Orkney and Shetland who are disappointed in the behaviour of their MP and want our politics conducted honestly and without smears"".Its stated goal is to ""raise an election petition in the courts"". It says: ""This could begin a process which could have the recent result in Orkney and Shetland overturned."" Mr Carmichael has been the Liberal Democrat MP for Orkney and Shetland since 2001. Before the general election he was Scottish secretary, a cabinet minister in the UK government.It was a position of power and influence that gave him access to confidential government documents.On 3 April, during the election campaign, the Daily Telegraph reported a leaked memo which gave an account of a private conversation between Nicola Sturgeon and the French Ambassador which suggested that the SNP leader wanted Tory leader David Cameron to remain prime minister.Ms Sturgeon denied the account and demanded an inquiry into the leak. The Cabinet Office inquiry concluded that Mr Carmichael and his special advisor Euan Roddin were responsible for the leak. When asked about the leak at the time, Carmichael said: ""The first I heard of this was when I received a phone call from a journalist"".In a letter of apology, Mr Carmichael said: ""Had I still been a government minister I would have considered this to be a matter that required my resignation. I have therefore informed the Cabinet Secretary that I will decline my ministerial severance payment.""For many this sanction is not enough and they feel he is not fit to be an MP.Those behind the crowdfunding petition says they want to hold Mr Carmichael ""accountable for his behaviour before, during and after the election campaign"".They are hoping to raise enough money for a legal challenge under the Representation of the People Act 1983.It states that electors or disappointed candidates can question the result of a parliamentary election if a candidate or their agents engage in ""corrupt or illegal practices"". The practices set out in the act include bribery (making illegal payments) and paying canvassers.Whether Mr Carmichael's actions are covered by  ""corrupt or illegal practices"" is the matter a court would have to decide.Last month the election of the Mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, was voided for a range of breaches of election law including voting fraud, false statements, bribery and spiritual influence, telling Bengali voters it was their ""religious duty"" to vote for him.However, the case of Labour's Phil Woolas in the 2010 general election is perhaps more relevant.He was removed from his Oldham East and Saddleworth seat for circulating lies about the personal character of his Liberal Democratic opponent during the general election campaign. He was the first MP to lose his seat in this way for almost a century. The specially convened election court ruled that comments in campaign material suggesting Lib Dem candidate Elwyn Watkins had tried to ""woo"" the votes of Muslim extremists clearly amounted to an attack on his personal character and conduct.Section 106 of the Representation of the People Act states that a person who ""makes or publishes any false statement of fact in relation to the candidate's personal character or conduct shall be guilty of an illegal practice, unless he can show that he had reasonable grounds for believing, and did believe, that statement to be true"".Alistair Carmichael, who won the Orkney and Shetland seat with a majority of just 817 votes, says he believed at the time that he authorised the leak that the comments made about Ms Sturgeon in the memo were a true account of her conversation.Christine O'Neill, chairman of Brodies LLP and expert in public law, told BBC Scotland: ""One issue here of course is that the first minister (Nicola Sturgeon) was not a candidate in this election.  ""The false statement must have been made with the aim of influencing the outcome of the election - and in order to see the successful candidate unseated it is also necessary to show that there was an actual impact on the outcome of the election.""There are few election petitions and fewer which are successful.  One of the most recent cases on false statements makes it clear that there is a distinction between saying something false about a candidate's personal conduct and character and making false statements about their political activities or conduct.""In the months before the end of the last parliament the Recall of MPs Act 2015 was given Royal Assent.It allows for a recall petition to be triggered if a MP is sentenced to a prison term or is suspended from the House of Commons for at least 21 sitting days. If 10% of the eligible electors in the MP's constituency signed a petition, the seat would be declared vacant and a by-election would follow. Mr Carmichael has not been convicted of a criminal offence or suspended from the House of Commons so this new law would not apply."
2015-05-29,Claptrap,https://web.archive.org//web/20150529152232/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32913113,"Britain's Parliament has some pretty bizarre rules - as the new intake of SNP MPs found out when they were given a stern warning for clapping during the Queen's Speech debate. So why is applause banned in the Commons?You can wave your order papers, shout until you are purple in the face, hurl abuse across the Chamber, join in with frankly weird displays of mass groaning or that elongated ""hear, hear"" thing they do.But try joining your party comrades in a sincere appreciation of a point well made in the traditional way and you will have Speaker John Bercow on his feet telling you to respect the traditions of the House.At least, that's what the 56 new SNP MPs found on Wednesday, when they broke into applause to support Angus Robertson, their leader at Westminster, who was hitting back at a furious attack on the party by Labour MP Ian Austin.""May I say at the start of the Parliament,"" said Mr Bercow, ""that the convention that we do not clap in this Chamber is very, very long established and widely respected, and it would be appreciated if Members showed some respect for that convention.""They will get their speaking rights from this Chair - of that they can be assured. They will be respected, but I would invite them to show some respect for the traditions of this Chamber of the House of Commons.""But like many other things in Britain's elasticated, unwritten constitution, the no-clapping convention is there to be broken.The most famous occasion was on the 27 July, 2007 when Tony Blair gave his farewell speech to the House of Commons.With wavering voice, the outgoing Labour prime minister admitted he was not really a Commons man, but he respected the place and the ""noble"" profession of politics, and with a final thespian flourish spoke his final words to the Chamber: ""I wish everyone, friend or foe, well and that's that, the end."" A ripple of applause on the Labour benches soon spread across the floor before turning into an unprecedented cross-party standing ovation.  It was an extraordinary scene - and one the then Speaker Michael Martin did nothing to stop.John Bercow himself has not always enforced the no-clapping rule as vigorously as he did on Wednesday.When the previous government mounted a last minute attempt to oust him as Speaker, on the final day of Parliament in March this year, Tory MP and friend of the speaker Charles Walker delivered an emotional speech denouncing what he saw as the underhand tactics of then-chief whip Michael Gove.The Speaker's supporters got to their feet to give Mr Walker a standing ovation.  A clearly overcome Mr Bercow let it go.Making a noise with the hands to show appreciation or disapproval is as old as civilisation itself.In ancient Rome, clapping was part of a repertoire of gestures, including the snapping of the finger and thumb and the flapping of togas, used by audiences at public performances.In French theatre, groups of professional clappers, known as ""claques"", were hired by performers to make them appear more popular with audiences.In politics, the length of the ovation at the end of a speech is sometimes seen as a sign of how well it went down.This took on a more sinister dimension in Soviet Russia, when party leaders would give long speeches with orchestrated applause and ovations.In the book Gulag Archipelago, author Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn recalls how someone toasted Stalin at a local Communist Party conference and ""stormy applause, rising to an ovation"", broke out. The great leader was not present but the applause continued regardless. ""Palms were getting sore and raised arms were already aching... however, who would dare be the first to stop?""So why is applause normally banned in the Commons?There is certainly plenty of claptrap spoken in the House (in the traditional sense of the word, meaning something designed to elicit applause).But MPs and members of the House of Lords are encouraged to find other outlets for their approval, mainly through the shouting of ""hear, hear!"", which started life in the 17th Century as a cry of ""hear him! hear him!"".The rules are laid out in the Parliamentary etiquette bible Erskine May, which says: ""Members must not disturb a Member who is speaking by hissing, chanting, clapping, booing, exclamations or other interruption."" But it adds: ""When not uttered till the end of a sentence, the cry of 'hear, hear,' offers no interruption of the speech."" MPs are well aware of how absurd this can sound to the uninitiated.The modernisation committee, set up by Tony Blair's government in an effort to drag the Commons into the 20th Century, said new MPs found it ""incomprehensible that it is not in order to clap at the end of a speech, a practice which is commonplace in other gatherings and indeed in other Parliaments"".But the committee backed the applause ban in a 1998 report:  ""While we agree that spontaneous clapping at the end of a speech could in no way be interpreted as disturbance of the speaker, there is a danger that such a practice might be open to abuse and could lead in certain circumstances to orchestration of what would amount to standing ovations with the success or failure of a speech being judged not by its content but by the relative length of the ovation at the end.""This might not disrupt an individual speech, but would disrupt the tenor of the debate, as indeed would slow handclapping.""So it looks as if MPs will have to continue sitting on their hands. And the SNP will have to find a new way to show their appreciation."
2015-05-29,Labour's battle,https://web.archive.org//web/20150529152232/http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-32913465,"Former Militant councillor Derek Hatton is attempting to rejoin the Labour Party. But what was Militant, asks Finlo Rohrer.The battle between the Labour Party and its Militant faction was one of the biggest political controversies in British politics in the 1980s. The Militant grouping had grown out of the Revolutionary Socialist League and was widely categorised as Trotskyist. From the mid-1970s its critics claimed it pursued an ""entryist"" policy of attempting to gain key positions within the Labour Party in an effort to promote its policies - including widespread nationalisation and a large programme of public works. Its most notable success was in Liverpool where the local Labour Party - dominated by Militant members - took control of the city council in 1983. Despite being only deputy leader, former firefighter Derek Hatton was seen as effectively in charge.""The best way to think of Militant is to think of Marxist-inspired socialists within the Labour Party,"" says Dr Peter North, author of Militant Liverpool: A City on the Edge.  Liverpool was particularly receptive to Militant's ideas because it had found itself ""on the wrong side of all the changes in global trade"", says North. A move to ""containerisation"" - increased use of shipping containers - was taking traffic away from the port. That and a partly associated decline in heavy industry were exacerbating unemployment and deprivation in the city. Militant started vehement opposition to the Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher, attempting to resist a reduction in the city's grant from central government by setting an illegal budget that allowed for more spending than there was income. ""They were in breach of Labour Party policies,"" says Peter Kilfoyle, a noted opponent of Militant who was a regional organiser for the Labour Party in the 1980s. ""They sought to go illegally against the government of the day when Labour Party policy was not to.""They were a party within a party. Their sole intention was to eat away at the Labour Party from the inside - taking away members and funding. They did it successfully."" Supporters of Militant point to the wave of building it initiated in Liverpool, replacing slum housing and improving sports and other leisure facilities. But the council did not have enough money to pay for its programme, and action by the district auditor was averted only by taking out loans. A move to apparently issue redundancy notices to every single council employee - ostensibly as a negotiating tactic - was widely criticised. Labour leader Neil Kinnock used a conference speech to attack Militant for ""the grotesque chaos of a Labour council hiring taxis to scuttle round a city handing out redundancy notices to its own workers"".In June 1986 Hatton was expelled from the Labour Party after a disciplinary hearing. A number of other politicians and activists were also thrown out. ""The decision was made to get rid of them,"" says Kilfoyle. ""They were in breach of the rules of the Labour Party.""But North argues that Militant were harshly treated. ""My view is that political parties that have a variety of attitudes within them are more democratic and healthy.""How an extreme group of left-wingers took over Liverpool City Council 30 years ago and opposed Margaret Thatcher's central government.

Mr Ladwa, Mr Modi's director of communications during India's general election in 2014, says Labour needs to do more to appeal to aspirational Indian voters in the UK following its disastrous election result.A lifelong Labour supporter, Mr Ladwa says the message from Indian doorsteps during the election campaign was clear - Labour needs to re-engage with Indians in Britain. ""A lot of British Indians that I've been speaking to feel that the Labour Party did not address the aspirational vote,"" he told the BBC Asian Network, in an exclusive interview. ""What about the people in the middle classes, people that traditionally have small businesses, are professionals, that have been sympathetic to the Labour Party, and often significant tax payers.""That's a view echoed by company director Senna Atwal. Although he voted for Labour in previous elections, he said he didn't feel the party offered anything for him in 2015. ""I don't think Labour. . . has any support for businesses, and they don't think about entrepreneurial individuals. It was really evident that they were on the back foot.""It is highly likely that Labour politicians have heard this many times since 8 May, but they seem to be in a listening mood. ""We have to have the humility to recognise that the voters are always right,"" says Sadiq Khan, the Labour MP for Tooting in South London, who is seeking the party's nomination to be London mayor.""We've got to ask ourselves the questions, to learn the lesson of that defeat and win back the trust and confidence of people who in the past have voted Labour, but now are not.""British Asian voters have traditionally been Labour supporters, but in a BBC Asian Network/ICM poll before the election nearly 25% were undecided about which party to support and 39% said they may change their minds.  A poll for think tank British Future conducted after the election suggests the Conservatives are gaining a greater share of the ethnic minority vote. In 2010, Labour had 68% of the ethnic minority vote, compared with the Conservatives' 16%. In 2015, Labour was still in the lead at 52%, but the Conservatives managed to get a third of ethnic minority votes, with the biggest leap amongst British Asians.  Nearly half of Hindus and Sikhs questioned for the Survation survey - in which more than 2,000 people took part - said they voted Conservative. This compared with 25% of Muslims.If these results were extrapolated across the estimated three million ethnic minority voters in the UK as a whole, the think tank said it would equate to 1.6 million votes for Labour and a million for the Conservatives - the Tories' largest ever figure. Dr Maria Sobolewska, a lecturer in politics at the University of Manchester, says Labour should be focusing on retaining all ethnic minority voters, rather than concentrating on Indian voters. ""We know that their emotional attachment to the party is getting weaker and weaker,"" she says.""At every single election, we see fewer of them identifying as Labour Party supporters, so it's not just the Indians, even though the Indians are the ones who seem to be going the fastest.""Whether the Labour Party and its politicians are able to translate new aspirational policies to attract Indian voters remains to be seen.  The party's desire to reset its appeal to entrepreneurs and middle class voters is a work in progress and Sadiq Khan says they have a lot of work to do before the next election in 2020. ""We've got to be going far more door to door, temple to temple, mosque to mosque to mosque, gurdwara to gurdwara,"" he says. ""We've got to get away from this 'gatekeeper' politics. Lazy politicians of all parties have relied upon community elders to pass the message to them (voters). We've got to move on from that.""Manoj Ladwa hopes to reiterate this message through Indians for Labour, not just to reconnect voters with the party, but because he thinks Indians in Britain have a crucial role to play economically and culturally. ""There are 1.5 million Indians in this country and India as a country is now emerging as a great economic superpower. Therefore Indians in this country will play a very important role as bridge builders between the UK and India.""You can hear more on Asian Network Reports at 13:00 and 17:00, BBC Asian Network Thursday 28 May."

Some MPs, including shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt, have suggested the next leader must seek re-election or re-endorsement before 2020.But interim Labour leader Ms Harman said whoever was elected should get on with the job for the next five years.A ""truth and reconciliation"" probe will examine Labour's defeat, she added.In an interview with the Observer, Ms Harman said that once a leader was elected it was ""for them to be getting on and doing that job"" until the next election, in 2020.It comes as Mr Hunt - who has ruled out standing in the leadership context - said the party should hold another leadership campaign in three years to make sure it had made the right choice as leader.Ms Harman said she had also warned leadership contenders at a recent shadow cabinet meeting that they should demonstrate their effectiveness as opposition politicians.She had told them ""the eyes of the party"" were on them, she said.Yvette Cooper, Andy Burnham, Liz Kendall and Mary Creagh have announced they will stand for the Labour leadership.Candidates must get the support of 35 of the party's MPs in order to stand in the contest, which will be decided in September.Ms Harman said ex-deputy leader Margaret Beckett would also lead a commission to examine ""in a forensic way"" the reasons behind Labour's election defeat.""We want at the end of this truth and reconciliation commission to have a better and honest understanding of why we ended up in this situation, but we need to be united and coherent in order to be attacking the government and also to make sure we are in a united position to go forward,"" she told the newspaper.Ms Harman said she believed voters had only made their minds up late on in the campaign not to back the party.There were ""a large number"" of undecided voters who had made up their minds at the last minute and ""stuck with the devil they knew"", she told the Observer.""There is some anecdotal information about people hovering outside the polling stations thinking 'Should I do this or that?' It is down to us to find out why we couldn't convince people to trust us,"" she added."
2015-05-30,Merkel: I'll work with UK on EU change,https://web.archive.org//web/20150531005125/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32925582,"Angela Merkel has said she does not rule out future treaty changes in Europe and will be a ""constructive partner"" to the UK in getting reforms. After talks with David Cameron, the German leader said her ""clear-cut"" view was that the UK should stay in the EU.While there was already ""common ground"" across many areas, she said progress on welfare would be ""more protracted"". The British prime minister said there was no ""magic"" solution to reform but ""where there's a will there's a way"".The PM, who is on a whistle-stop tour of Europe trying to gather support for changes he wants before holding the UK's EU membership referendum, also repeated his call for Fifa boss Sepp Blatter to stand down as soon as possible.Speaking at a press conference after their talks in Berlin, Mrs Merkel said the two leaders had begun to talk about ""specific issues"" of future reform after Mr Cameron's general election victory.She told journalists that Germany and other EU countries had ""red lines"" - such as upholding the principle of freedom of movement - but that she hoped as far as possible to accommodate the UK's demands.""Where there is a desire there is a way,"" she said. ""That should be our guiding principle.""She added: ""We would like to be a part of the process that is going on in Great Britain at the moment and we would like to be a constructive partner in this process.The picture on the German news site Spiegel is striking: the British prime minister leaning in close to kiss a smiling German chancellor. But the accompanying headline was more of a surprise to Germans: ""Merkel doesn't rule out treaty change!""Because Mrs Merkel, like the leaders of France and Poland, has thus far drawn the line at treaty change.  Now she seems to be saying: ""Let's look at the content of what Mr Cameron wants before we assess how - and if - we can achieve it"".  Today's working lunch at the chancellery (which reportedly consisted of shrimp tartar with salad, veal escalope, asparagus and potatoes, followed by strawberries) seems to have set a conciliatory tone. Her apparent willingness to compromise may irritate some. A senior German business figure told me that Mrs Merkel should refuse to negotiate with Mr Cameron while he's threatening to pull Britain out of the EU. Volker Treier, who represents the German Chambers of Industry and Commerce, said they were all ""astonished"" by the prospect of a referendum on UK membership. And the overwhelming view from Berlin is: Germany needs Britain in the EU. It's an important political and economic ally and, in the words of one senior conservative politician, ""we're ready to do anything that can be done to keep Britain in the EU"".  Mr Cameron repeated his belief that the changes could only be achieved through treaty change, a move opposed by some European countries, including France, but he said what mattered was the ""substance"" of the reforms not the method by which they would be achieved.""This is about starting the process,"" he said of the talks. ""Of course it is going to be difficult but the important thing is to get it under way.""On the prospect of treaty change, Mrs Merkel said: ""If we're convinced of the substance we shouldn't say it's impossible to change the treaty. We should concentrate on the substance, not too much on formalities.""The UK prime minister, who earlier concluded a brief visit to Poland, has not set out in full detail the reforms he is pushing for but they will include tougher rules to prevent migrants claiming benefits.He also wants safeguards to protect the City of London in the event of closer eurozone integration and an exemption for Britain from the EU drive for ""ever closer union"". Securing the backing of Ms Merkel, who leads Europe's largest economy, will be crucial to Mr Cameron's hopes of presenting a package reforms to voters ahead of the UK's in/out referendum, which will take place before the end of 2017.After Mr Cameron's breakfast meeting with Polish Prime Minister Ewa Kopacz, Downing Street said the UK and Poland agreed on the need for more powers for national parliaments and for countries outside the eurozone to be treated fairly in the event of closer integration within the single currency bloc. ""On immigration and welfare, Prime Minister Kopacz welcomed the prime minister's commitment to respect the principle of free movement,"" a No 10 spokesman added. ""They agreed that there were issues concerning the interaction between free movement and national welfare systems that should be discussed further.""Speaking ahead of the visit Rafal Trzaskowski, Poland's Minister for European Affairs, told the BBC they would listen but that any treaty change or attempt to restrict access to benefits for EU migrants would be difficult.""As far as treaty changes are concerned or the introduction of discriminatory measures, that would be a red line for Poland.""He added: ""If every country comes with a shopping list to change European Union policies, that will be the end of the European construction, it will simply implode.""The UKIP Independence Party, which wants the UK to leave the European Union, said David Cameron's promised referendum on the UK's future in Europe - due by the end of 2017 - was about who governs the country rather than the details of benefits policy.""David Cameron is trying to make the UK's relationship with the European Union simply a question of migrant access to benefits,"" said its leader Nigel Farage. ""In reality, this is a marginal detail of a far bigger problem - both with mass inward migration putting pressure on wages and causing huge problems in the provision of public services and housing and also in the broader sense of our relationship with an out of date, sclerotic, over-regulated bloc.""David Cameron is starting renegotiation of the terms of Britain's EU membership ahead of a referendum.

2015-05-30,Legal bid to oust Carmichael as MP,https://web.archive.org//web/20150531005125/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32930488,"Campaigners have begun a legal attempt to overturn the election of the former cabinet minister Alistair Carmichael as the MP for Orkney and Shetland.The Lib Dem MP has faced calls to resign over the leak of a memo which suggested SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon wanted David Cameron as prime minister.A petition was lodged at the Court of Session in Edinburgh in the name of four islanders.They raised more than £40,000 through the internet to pay their legal costs.The petition alleges that Mr Carmichael, Scotland's only remaining Lib Dem MP, breached Section 106 of the Representation of the People Act 1983, which outlaws false statements in relation to the ""personal character or conduct"" of a candidate.Section 106 of the Representation of the People Act states that a person who ""makes or publishes any false statement of fact in relation to the candidate's personal character or conduct shall be guilty of an illegal practice, unless he can show that he had reasonable grounds for believing, and did believe, that statement to be true"".Read more here.It was presented to judge Lord Uist and will now be considered by the Election Court in what is believed to be the first case of its kind in Scotland for half a century.The court heard that the petition would focus on ""character"" rather than ""conduct"".""Today is the start of clearing the air which has become really poisonous in our islands,"" said Tim Morrison, one of the petitioners, outside the court in Edinburgh.""We would like Alistair Carmichael to stand down,"" he said, adding that it should be up to the voters of Orkney and Shetland to decide whether or not to re-elect him in a by-election.Mr Morrison and his fellow campaigners allege that the electorate was misled because Mr Carmichael lied about his knowledge of a controversial memo about the SNP leader.Last week, an official Cabinet Office inquiry found Mr Carmichael approved the leak of the memo, which was published at the start of the general election campaign on 3 April.The document, written by a civil servant in the Scotland Office, claimed Scotland's first minister told the French Ambassador to the UK that she would prefer Mr Cameron as prime minister rather than Ed Miliband.Both Ms Sturgeon and the ambassador insisted this was not the case, and the memo had contained a disclaimer that parts of the conversation may have been ""lost in translation"".The Lib Dem MP wrote to Ms Sturgeon to apologise, saying the ""publication was a serious breach of protocol and the details of that account are not correct"".At the time of the leak, Mr Carmichael had said he first heard of the memo when he was contacted by a journalist.He has since acknowledged that while he had not seen the document before it was published, he was aware of its content and agreed that it should be made public.Opponents said that if the truth about who leaked the memo had emerged during the general election campaign it could have altered the result in his constituency, where the former Secretary of State for Scotland was returned by a majority of just 817.Tim Morrison said he was a member of the Scottish National Party but insisted the action was not politically motivated.""I am here as a voter in my constituency,"" said Mr Morrison, 50, who flew from Kirkwall to Edinburgh on Friday morning and arrived at the court shortly after 15:00.""We hope this process redeems the individual and the nature of politics in one go.""There have been protests on the islands calling for Mr Carmichael to stand down but he insists he will not, saying he has apologised, forfeited his ministerial pay-off and will continue as MP.The parliamentary standards commissioner is considering whether to accept a complaint about his conduct. Police Scotland have also received a complaint."

At present there are 171,000 people from elsewhere in the European Union who live and work in Scotland.""They contribute hugely to the diversity of our culture, the prosperity of our economy, and the strength of our society.""She will add: ""Polls in Scotland consistently show strong support for EU membership. That is why we will propose a 'double lock', meaning that exit from the European Union would only be possible if all UK nations agreed. That way Scotland couldn't be forced out of the European Union against our will.""Speaking to business leaders in Edinburgh last week, Ms Sturgeon reiterated her opposition to the Tories' in-out referendum on UK membership of the EU, and said her Government would ""work to protect Scotland's interests"".During a speech in Glasgow on Saturday, Scottish Labour leader candidate Kezia Dugdale called for EU nationals who have made the UK their home to allowed to vote in the referendum on Europe.Earlier this week, No 10 said citizens from most EU countries living in the UK would not get a vote.The SNP has also said it is ""absolutely vital"" the referendum on Europe is as inclusive as possible."
2015-05-30,'Named person' campaign steps up,https://web.archive.org//web/20150531005125/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32945282,"Opponents of plans to appoint a ""named person"" for every child in Scotland have stepped up their campaign ahead of legal action against the policy.The measure, which assigns a single point of contact to look out for under-18s, is already being piloted.But the No To Named Persons (NO2NP) coalition claimed the policy breached data protection and human rights laws.The Scottish government said the policy represented the ""best interests"" of young people.The initiative, part of the Children and Young People's (Scotland) Act is already being rolled out in parts of Scotland including Highland, Edinburgh, Fife, Angus and South Ayrshire, and means every child in Scotland will have a ""named"" teacher, health visitor or other professional looking out for their welfare.It is due to be extended to other parts of Scotland in 2016.Ministers have said the person would act as a liaison between the child, their family and access to any services they may need.Those in favour also believe it would help stop vulnerable children slipping through the net.However, critics - including some Christian groups - have said the policy is ""anti-democratic"" and diminishes the role of parents.The Scottish courts have already refused a petition for a judicial review of the legislation at the Court of Session, but NO2NP appealed the decision.A panel of three judges will now consider the case again during a two-day hearing at the court due to start on Wednesday.A spokesman for NO2NP, which has been gathering signatures from parents against the move, said: ""We remain deeply concerned about the threats to the human rights of families to their privacy in their own homes as well as the breaches of data protection laws as the state passes confidential family information to and from different public bodies.""It is anti-democratic, breaches the privacy of families and is an unwelcome intrusion into the lives of ordinary mums and dads trying to do their best to bring up their children.""The state thinks the named person - a health visitor, a teacher or other professional - can fulfil the role better than mums and dads which is ridiculous.""The legal challenge is being led by the Christian Institute with the support of the Christian charity Care, the Tymes Trust and the Family Education Trust as well as some academics and parents.A spokesman for the Scottish government said the courts had ruled that the policy does not contravene ECHR rights or EU law.He added: ""The ruling also found that the service was developed carefully over more than a decade with extensive input and wide support from experts and encourages professionals to work together. ""It also recognised that through prevention and early intervention, the service seeks to put the best interests of every child at the heart of decision making.""The 'named person' will offer advice or assistance when it's needed, there is no obligation on parents or children to approach the service.""

2015-05-30,Labour 'squeamish' on immigration,https://web.archive.org//web/20150531005125/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32936954,"Labour was ""squeamish"" about talking about immigration in the past, Yvette Cooper has said. In an interview broadcast on BBC Newsnight, the party's leadership contender said immigration needed to be ""controlled"" and ""managed"".She also said that ""ideally"" the Labour government should have had a financial surplus before the crisis of 2008.   Ms Cooper is one of four MPs who have announced they will stand for the Labour leadership.Andy Burnham,  Liz Kendall and Mary Creagh are also standing.Candidates are required to gather the signatures of 35 MPs by 15 June to make it on to the ballot paper.The winner will be announced on 12 September.Speaking to Newsnight's chief correspondent Laura Kuenssberg, Ms Cooper said: ""I think it's not so much about exactly what the detail of the policies are, it's about not being squeamish about talking about immigration. ""Because it's important for Britain, but it has to be controlled and managed so that the system is fair... we should talk about the way we control and manage it but also the way you can benefit from high skilled migration from students coming from Britain.""Ms Cooper also said people like Alan Milburn and John Hutton, who have called for the party to skip a generation when choosing a new leader, were ""trapped in the past"".She said they were ""fighting battles from 2004 and 2005... wanting to settle old scores from the Labour Party's history.""She also said that she made ""no apology for having experience"" when the job is so tough. Asked if it was wrong for the party to have run up a deficit before the financial crash, Yvette Cooper admitted: ""I'm saying that ideally you would have had it in surplus, so yes, we should have had it in surplus by that time. ""However, what was the consequence of that? The Tories want to say that either it caused the financial crisis which it clearly didn't, or they want to say that it made it harder to deal with the financial crisis which it also didn't."""

2015-05-30,Jewish sect female drive ban condemned,https://web.archive.org//web/20150531005125/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32935767,"A ban on women driving their children to school issued by a Jewish education institution is ""unacceptable"", Education Secretary Nicky Morgan says.Leaders of the ultra-Orthodox Belz sect in north London wrote to parents saying ""no child will be allowed to learn in our school"" if their mother drives. Women driving ""goes against the laws of modesty within our society"", it said.A spokesman from the Belz Community said they were ""saddened"" by the ""misrepresentation"" of the notice.The Home Office said it would be inappropriate to comment on individual cases, adding that the government ""believes everyone in this country is equal and everybody is free to lead their lives as they see fit"".The Belz, who originated in Ukraine in the early 19th Century, are an ultra-Orthodox sect who follow Haredi Judaism.The letter, which was signed from the ""spiritual management"" of Belz institutions, said: ""There has been an increase in incidences of mothers of our students who have begun driving cars, something that goes against the laws of modesty within our society.""This had led to ""a lot of exasperation among other parents"", it said.The group's leader in Israel, Rabbi Yissachar Dov Rokeach, had advised that ""if a woman is driving a car, she cannot send her children to be educated in Belz institutions"", it said.It added that women with a ""specific reason"" to drive could submit a request to a special committee.The Belz community are part of the Haredi community - ultra-orthodox Jews for whom religion is a defining part of their identity. Although historically a small part of the overall Jewish population in Britain, the Haredi are growing, mostly because of their high birth rate.  They are already the dominant group among Jewish communities in Hackney, Haringey, Salford, and Gateshead, and the Institute of Jewish Policy Research (IJPR) says that Haredi numbers will double in size every eighteen years. An emphasis on studying the Torah has led to concerns that Haredi boys are leaving school with few qualifications. Men often continue with their prayer studies after marriage, rather than seek work, and those who do have employment have been affected by changes in traditional occupations, like textiles. As a result, poverty and deprivation tend to hit Haredi households hard, and there's evidence that Haredi areas in Hackney, for example, receive higher than average rates of means-tested benefits. The IJPR though, says that the insular nature of Haredi life also produces a highly-supportive community, whose members work hard to help each other. The Jewish Chronicle, which first reported the story, said that while many Hasidic women do not drive, this is thought to be the first formal declaration against the practice in the UK. Dina Brawer, UK Ambassador of the Jewish Orthodox Feminist Alliance, said the rule was ""stupid and impractical"" and could not work.Responding to the letter, Education Secretary and Minister for Women and Equalities, Nicky Morgan, said: ""This is completely unacceptable in modern Britain. ""If schools do not actively promote the principle of respect for other people they are breaching the independent school standards. ""Where we are made aware of such breaches we will investigate and take any necessary action to address the situation.""But in a statement to Mrs Morgan from the Belz community, a spokesman said it never intended to ""stigmatise or discriminate against children or their parents"".It said: ""We are proud of what we stand for and we do not feel the need to excuse ourselves for our deeply held beliefs and staunchly maintained way of life. ""It has withstood the test of time and is not prone to the vagaries of passing fads.""The statement continued: ""In an effort to formulate these guidelines the issue of women driving cars became conflated with broader issues which we intended to address. ""It is a fact that most women in our community do not drive cars. It is equally true that a fair number of women do drive cars openly and entirely unhindered. ""They and their families are as respected within our community as any other members and we have no intention of changing that.""This goes to the heart of what is a fantastically difficult problem now facing the government in drafting a counter-extremism bill that protects against extremism, but also safeguards religious freedom. Earlier this year, Home Secretary Theresa May defined extremism as ""the vocal or active opposition to fundamental British values, including democracy, the rule of law, individual liberty and the mutual respect and tolerance of different faiths and beliefs"". It throws up the question, is a religious ban on women driving active opposition to the British value of individual liberty? And how do you square that with the other British value of mutual respect and tolerance for different faiths and beliefs? Be assured that there will be some very big legal brains at the Home Office grappling with this issue right now, trying to define extremism in a way that is workable and effective. But if such issues as religious driving bans are to be covered by the extremism bill, those responsible could be subject to a banning order which could ban an entire organisation, or a disruption order that aims to curtail the acts of an individual.These could be civil orders - like the Asbo-type orders that we're familiar with, which ban people from a particular activity - but breaching them is a criminal offence which can carry a significant custodial sentence.A spokesman for the Office of the Chief Rabbi in the UK said: ""The Belz Chasidic dynasty has contributed significantly to the rich tapestry of our tradition but this particular view is entirely removed from mainstream Jewish practice."" Labour said its shadow women and equalities minister, Gloria De Piero, had written to the Equalities and Human Rights Commission asking them to investigate the lawfulness of the driving ban.  "
2015-05-30,No senior black staff in the Lords,https://web.archive.org//web/20150531005125/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32932959,"There are no black or minority ethnic (BME) staff reported in the top seven pay levels of the House of Lords administration, according to data obtained by the BBC.All 89 of the most senior employees whose ethnicity has been declared are white (there are also three senior staff who have not stated this information).In contrast five out of six workers in the lowest pay grade are ethnic minorities.The Lord Speaker Baroness D'Souza, a cross-bench peer who chairs House sittings, described the data as ""disappointing"". She said she would be monitoring progress from now on.   Lord Ouseley, formerly chair of the Commission for Racial Equality, warned that the House's top positions form ""a 'no entry' area for BME employees"".The figures have been released by the House of Lords in response to a BBC Freedom of Information request about the ethnic profile of the House's own workforce, numbering nearly 600, from clerks to catering. It does not include researchers and other staff directly employed by peers themselves, or bicameral staff shared with the Commons.  The seven top pay bands range from £49,083 to £176,226 including the senior clerks and managers of administrative workers. The maximum salary in a pay range containing a declared black or ethnic minority employee is £42,686. The FOI request revealed black and minority ethnic workers are overwhelmingly concentrated in the House's lower pay bands, with over half the BME workforce employed in housekeeping, catering and retail. Five out of six workers at the lowest pay level are BME, earning between £17,135 and £17,744 a year. This is just above the annual London ""living wage"", which based on the Lords' 36 hour working week would be £17,128.80.  Overall, 13% of Lords staff have declared themselves as BME. London's working population is currently 37% BME. But in the chamber itself only 6% of peers are ethnic minority.The ethnic profile of House of Commons staff follows a similar pattern to the Lords, but is less extreme. It has just 6% BME representation in the top seven pay levels, with 40% at the catering level. The Commons launched a diversity scheme in 2012, aiming to improve minority representation at senior levels. It issues an annual report containing ethnic data of this sort.But the House of Lords has no equivalent formal published strategy with regular monitoring data.   A Lords spokesman said: ""The House values diversity in its staff and is working hard to improve its record in this area. Our record on diversity has not been good enough but is improving and will continue to do so.""The Lords administration argues that change at senior levels is slow because of the House's relatively low staff turnover rate, which is well down on the national average.The House has revamped its application process to promote equality and says it is widening access to development opportunities.But Lord Ouseley accused the House administration of recruiting and promoting from sources that are too restricted. He said: ""If it wants to achieve diversity at the middle and higher pay grades, the Lords will have to cut away from the sources which deliver more of the same and pursue avenues that would enhance the gathering of talent from a bigger and more diverse pool of talent.""It will only ever change if there is a political determination to make equality a reality, and that is not about to happen."""
2015-05-30,Jail terms under 'legal highs' law,https://web.archive.org//web/20150531005125/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32919712,"A new ""blanket ban"" on so-called legal highs will carry prison sentences of up to seven years, the government says.Ministers are to publish draft laws they say are a ""landmark"" in prohibiting the substances' production, distribution, sale and supply.Legal highs, officially called new psychoactive substances, have been linked to a number of deaths.Ministers said young people who took them were ""taking exceptional risks with their health"".A blanket ban on legal highs, which are often sold online or on the high street, was in the Conservative Party's election manifesto and featured in the Queen's Speech.Labour also promised to ban their sale and distribution in its manifesto.The Psychoactive Substances Bill applied to ""any substance intended for human consumption that is capable of producing a psychoactive effect"", the government said.Alcohol, tobacco and caffeine will be excluded, and there are also exemptions for food and medical products, while controlled drugs will continue to be regulated by existing laws.The new restrictions will also extend to the sale of nitrous oxide - also known as laughing gas or ""hippy crack"" - for human use.What are legal highs?The government said the ""legitimate sale"" of nitrous oxide, which is also used for food processing, medicinal and industrial purposes, would not be affected.Home Office minister Mike Penning said the measures would ""fundamentally change the way we tackle new psychoactive substances"".They would end the ""game of cat and mouse"" whereby new drugs appeared on the market more quickly than the government could identify and ban them, he said.He added: ""The blanket ban will give police and other law enforcement agencies greater powers to tackle the reckless trade in psychoactive substances, instead of having to take a substance-by-substance approach.""Legal highs are not controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Act, although individual substances, such as mephedrone, have been outlawed.The government's proposals would apply throughout the United Kingdom, and would include powers to seize and destroy legal highs and to search people, premises and vehicles.Civil measures - including prohibition notices and prohibition orders - will also be possible.Commander Simon Bray, of the National Police Chiefs' Council, said: ""A blanket ban on new psychoactive substances will make it simpler for law enforcement to deal with those drugs which are potentially unsafe but which may not yet be controlled."""
2015-05-30,Cameron: Sepp Blatter 'should go',https://web.archive.org//web/20150531005125/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-32931356,"David Cameron has said Fifa president Sepp Blatter must resign, adding ""the sooner that happens the better"".His comments came before Mr Blatter was re-elected after refusing to withdraw from the contest, despite the arrest of senior colleagues on major corruption charges.But the PM said Fifa could only rebuild its credibility if Mr Blatter left.It comes as the UK's Serious Fraud Office (SFO) said it was looking at material relating to the allegations.Seven senior Fifa officials were arrested at a hotel in Switzerland on Wednesday.The US Justice Department (DOJ) has charged 14 people with racketeering, wire fraud and money laundering conspiracy.Mr Cameron's comments came ahead of the vote for the presidency of Fifa in Zurich, Switzerland.Despite widespread criticism, Fifa president Sepp Blatter was re-elected for a fifth term.His only rival, Jordan's Prince Ali bin al-Hussein, withdrew after the first round of voting in which neither candidate managed to secure the two-thirds majority needed.Speaking in Berlin, Mr Cameron said: ""You cannot have accusations of corruption at this level and on this scale in this organisation and pretend that the person currently leading it is the right person to take it forward.""That cannot be the case. Frankly, what we've seen is the ugly side of the beautiful game and he should go.  ""And the sooner that happens the better - the faster that organisation can start to rebuild its credibility, which is going to be so important because so many people around the world want to see this game properly managed, properly looked after, so we can all enjoy the World Cups of the future.""Mr Cameron, who is holding EU reform talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, said it was ""unthinkable"" that Mr Blatter should stay.He also said he would be ""guided"" by the Football Association (FA) chairman, Greg Dyke, over the question of whether the bids for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups should be reopened.Former culture minister David Lammy, who plans to run for London mayor in 2016, said Qatar was ""not a fit venue"" for the World Cup following the alleged corruption.He said: ""I want to see David Cameron and [London Mayor] Boris Johnson saying this isn't OK and offering Britain as an alternative venue. ""Let's put a serious offer on the table for the home of football - Britain -  to host the 2022 World Cup.""Earlier on Friday, Mr Dyke suggested that he would not rule out a boycott of the major football tournaments if Mr Blatter remained at the helm of Fifa.The Union of European Football Associations (Uefa), Europe's governing body, may consider boycotting future World Cups if Mr Blatter wins Friday's vote, according to Scottish FA chief executive Stewart Regan.Meanwhile, the SFO said it was actively assessing ""material in its possession"" relating to Fifa corruption allegations.It said it had ""made plain that it stands ready to assist ongoing international criminal investigations"".It said its probe had been ongoing for months, before Wednesday's indictments.The SFO said it was not willing to comment further on the nature of material in its possession or current activity in this area.  It added that it had not launched a formal criminal investigation.  But it said there were two ways in which it could get involved - if the SFO opened a formal criminal investigation itself or provided ""mutual legal assistance"" to overseas law enforcement.It also says it has made plain to both US and Swiss authorities that it stands ready to assist.""There are currently international criminal investigations into allegations of corruption at Fifa. As such it would be inappropriate for the SFO to comment on the matter at this time,"" it said.In November the SFO asked for anyone with information regarding alleged corruption in the bidding for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to come forward.However, it will not now say if its current actions relate to either of the above tournaments."
2015-05-30,MEPs in new EU-US trade controversy,https://web.archive.org//web/20150531005125/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-32916750,"Euro MPs have called for transparent and public handling of trade disputes with the US, but they have softened their stance on much-criticised commercial courts.The MEP panel's report on EU-US free trade talks - called the TTIP talks - goes before the full European Parliament for a vote on 10 June.A major European consumer group, BEUC, criticised the report, as did Green and socialist MEPs.MEPs can veto an EU-US trade deal.The stakes are high in TTIP - it could create the world's biggest free trade zone, giving a much-needed boost to business on both sides of the Atlantic. The parliament's trade committee passed the package of recommendations by 28 votes to 13 on Thursday. A German Social Democrat, Bernd Lange, was the lead MEP who drafted report.The American Chamber of Commerce in the EU called the report ""a significant positive step of support towards the trade deal"" and noted the EU's ""commitment to transparency and democratic principles as key elements"". One of the most controversial aspects of TTIP is the investment rules. It remains unclear whether a foreign investor would have access to a system known as investor state dispute settlement, or ISDS. Critics say ISDS tribunals lack transparency and can give too much leverage to powerful corporations in disputes with states.The original draft of the MEPs' report said fair, non-discriminatory treatment of foreign investors ""can be achieved without the inclusion of an ISDS mechanism - such a mechanism is not necessary in TTIP given the EU's and US' developed legal systems"".However, a later amendment dropped that mention of ISDS. It called simply for investment cases to be treated ""in a transparent manner by publicly appointed, independent professional judges in public hearings"", with respect for national courts' jurisdiction.BEUC said that ""deplorably"" the MEPs ""took a very ambiguous stance"" on ISDS. ""We have yet to see any facts justifying its inclusion in an EU/US trade deal. We hope MEPs when voting in plenary will demand the exclusion of this outdated, discriminatory and unneeded mechanism.""And a leading Green MEP, Yannick Jadot, said the report ""does not reflect the ever growing concern among the public and civil society with the TTIP negotiations and their overt corporate agenda"".  But British Labour MEP David Martin praised the report's demand for ""strong protection of labour and environmental rules"" and ""bringing an end to secret investor tribunals"". The MEPs' views influence the European Commission's stance in the wide-ranging trade talks, covering issues such as food safety, data protection, trademarks and competition in transport and public procurement.

And who is vying for the deputy leader job?Shadow health minister Liz Kendall was the first Labour MP to say they wanted a crack at the party's top job, saying a ""fundamentally new approach"" was needed.First elected to Parliament in 2010 as MP for Leicester West and appointed to the shadow front bench the same year, Ms Kendall is seen as a Blairite contender.She is a former special adviser to Harriet Harman and then Health Secretary Patricia Hewitt who has argued for reform of public services.In an interview for The House magazine in January, she said there ""will remain a role"" for private and voluntary firms in the health service, ""where they can add extra capacity to the NHS or challenge to the system"".Could she be a fresh face to lead a change of direction for Labour, or seen as too inside the Westminster bubble?The Labour MP for Leigh since 2001, Andy Burnham has plenty of government experience and is the current bookies' favourite.Mr Burnham served as health secretary under Gordon Brown and previously as culture secretary and chief secretary to the Treasury.He stood for the leadership in 2010 but lost out to Ed Miliband, going on to hold the shadow health brief under Mr Miliband's leadership. He is said to have strong trade union support.Declaring his intention to stand, he said Labour must support the ""aspirations of everyone"".Another former chief secretary to the Treasury - as well as a work and pensions minister under Gordon Brown - Yvette Cooper has been shadow home secretary for the past four years.A strong Commons performer, she has given Home Secretary Theresa May a hard time over matters including passport delays, border controls and extremism.She did not stand to succeed Mr Brown in 2010, in favour of her husband, Ed Balls.Announcing her bid this time around, she said: ""Our promise of hope wasn't strong enough to drown out the Tory and UKIP voices of fear. That's what we need to change.""The shadow international development secretary has announced her intention to join the race for the Labour leadership, via an article in the Daily MailMs Creagh joined parliament in 2005 as the MP for Wakefield, gaining experience in government as an assistant whip in 2009-10.She's also held various shadow cabinet positions in opposition, most notably as shadow secretary of state for environment, food and rural affairs - and transport.Ms Creagh held onto her brief as international development secretary in acting Labour leader Harriet Harman's recent reshuffle of the shadow cabinet.Rushanara Ali announced her intention to run for Labour's deputy leadership claiming the party had become ""unelectable"".She was first elected in 2010 in Bethnal Green and Bow, defeating incumbent MP George Galloway.

Another from the 2010 intake, she was praised for campaign against payday loans companies, and has a strong following on social media.She told the Sunday Mirror: ""Too many voters think Labour is no longer a movement for social justice but a machine that only kicks in to gear at election time.""Shadow environment secretary Angela Eagle plans to travel the country to speak to people who did the ""hard graft"" in the election campaign.The MP for Wallasey said Labour could not be ""complacent"" if it was to reverse its general election defeat.Ms Eagle, an MP since 1992, held a number of ministerial jobs during the last Labour government and in 2013 became chair of the Labour Party.She is arguably best-known for having a twin sister, Maria, who is also a Labour MP.A former journalist and Labour cabinet minister, Ben Bradshaw has been the MP for Exeter since 1997.He plans a ""big tent"" approach to ensure Labour does not miss out on votes in the south of England, saying the party has to ""broaden its appeal"".Reflecting on who should replace Ed Miliband, he said: ""I would prefer to see one of the new generation come forward rather than someone associated with the Blair and Brown era.""If we really want to win in 2020 - and I think we need to for the country's sake -  I would like to see someone from the new generation without that baggage from the past.""The MP for Tottenham was the first person to publicly weigh up a leadership bid, telling the BBC that he would consider standing if colleagues wanted him to.But he's ruled himself out of the top job, saying his principal aim is to become Labour's candidate for Mayor of London in 2016.""I think we need a leader that can win back the Midlands understand Scotland as well as the south.""Actually we need to do better in London, my strengths are in London and the south therefore I want to be the Labour candidate for Mayor,"" he told the BBC's Daily Politics programme.One of the most prominent black MPs in the party, the former former barrister is regarded as being on the right of the party, having served as a minister under both Tony Blair and Gordon Brown.His national profile rose during the 2011 riots in London, when he appealed for calm and reconciliation in the wake of the fatal shooting of Mark Duggan in his north London constituency. Dame Tessa Jowell was a key figure at the heart of New Labour - she once said she would ""jump under a bus"" for Tony Blair.The former Dulwich and West Norwood MP, who stood down at the general election after 20 years in Parliament, earned widespread plaudits for the role she played in London's bid for the 2012 Olympics and her subsequent performance as Olympics minister.She has vowed to bring ""Olympic-like discipline"" to changing London, promising to build more affordable homes.The former culture secretary, who was a psychiatric social worker before entering politics, is seen as one of the frontrunners in the race to be Labour's mayoral candidate, with one poll suggesting she is backed by 40% of Labour supporters.Sadiq Khan launched his bid to be London mayor with an attack on incumbent Boris Johnson, describing him as a ""red carpet mayor, somebody who is fantastic going to openings, great with a flute of champagne in his hands"".""I'd rather roll up my sleeves and fight for all Londoners,"" he added.The son of a bus driver, Mr Khan worked as a human rights solicitor before becoming an MP in 2005.

Now more than ever our city needs a Mayor who will stand up for the interests of those increasingly left behind,"" she added.A journalist and railway historian, Christian Wolmar is one of Britain's most in-demand transport pundits.The only non-politician in the race, he campaigns against the construction of HS2 and has vowed to tackle London's ""housing crisis"", improve the transport network and revitalise public spaces.""Instead of partisan and personality politics London needs a dedicated, ideas driven mayor who works for Londoners and their needs,"" he said.The 65-year-old cycles to campaign meeting and claims to have clocked up more than 2,000 miles already.Chuka Umunna was the second candidate to declare he would stand for election as leader of the Labour Party.A rising star of the party, Mr Umunna was first elected to Parliament in 2010 and appointed shadow business secretary the following year.He has retained the seat of Streatham with a majority of nearly 14,000 and a vastly increased vote share this time round.He announced his intention to stand via a post on his Facebook page. He said he had spoken to half the Labour 80 candidates standing in Tory seats targeted by the party and other MPs before making his announcement. However, three days later Mr Umunna withdrew from the leadership contest. He said in a statement posted on his Twitter feed that had been uncomfortable with the level of ""sheer pressure"" and scrutiny that came with being a candidate.The 36-year-old added that it had perhaps been ""too soon"" for him to launch a leadership bid.Another rising star of the 2010 intake, the MP for Leeds West was appointed shadow chief secretary to the Treasury in 2011 and shadow work and pensions secretary in 2013.During the election campaign, she attacked the so-called bedroom tax, whereby housing benefit payments are reduced for tenants in council and social housing deemed to have spare rooms.However, she also suggested Labour would consider reducing the overall welfare cap in some areas.She told BBC News Labour needs ""to be in the centre ground to win a general election"" but ruled herself out of a leadership bid.A former home secretary and shadow chancellor, Alan Johnson is the Labour leadership candidate who never quite was.The popular MP declined to stand in 2010 and stepped down from his shadow cabinet role in 2011 for personal reasons.Earlier this year it was reported that senior New Labour figures Lord Mandelson and Alistair Campbell approached Mr Johnson over a leadership bid, although all three later distanced themselves from the story.But the former postman, who has been MP for Hull West and Hessle since 1997, had seemingly ruled himself out again, saying it is a ""10-year job"" and he does not have the ""right qualities"". Former army officer Dan Jarvis was elected MP for Barnsley Central in a by-election in 2011, having resigned his commission as a major in the Parachute Regiment to contest the seat.He held onto his seat at the general election, taking time out from campaigning to run the London Marathon last month.After entering Parliament in 2010, he quickly became a shadow culture, media and sport minister and later a shadow justice minister.In 2011, Mr Jarvis became the first serving politician in more than 60 years to be awarded a military honour, when he was made an MBE for his services to the armed forces.He has been touted by some colleagues as a future Labour leader but Mr Jarvis, who was widowed in 2010 and has a young family, ruled himself out, saying it is not the ""right time"" for him and his family. Historian and journalist Tristram Hunt entered Parliament in 2010 as Labour MP for Stoke-on-Trent Central.Ed Miliband made him shadow education secretary in 2013 and he has been a fierce critic of the coalition's education policies in England.Speaking in the aftermath of the election results, he called on Labour's ruling National Executive Committee ""not to rush our election"", saying there was time for a ""brutal post-mortem"" about Labour's ""underlying philosophy and thinking"".As for his own ambitions, he said ""it's about the lyrics as much as the lead singer I think"".He later said he was not confident of getting enough nominations to stand, and would support Liz Kendall.The MP for Rochdale says the deputy leader vacancy has ""come a bit too soon"" for him.He previously said a number of colleagues had asked him to put his name forward for the role.Mr Danczuk is well known for his prominent campaigning against child sex abuse and leading calls for an inquiry into allegations of historical child sex abuse by senior figures at Westminster.He was a vocal critic of Ed Miliband and in an article for the Daily Telegraph on Thursday he said Labour needed to ""step out if its Metropolitan comfort zone"" and ""reach out to the country once more.""The former director of public prosecutions has only just become an MP after being elected in Frank Dobson's old seat of Holborn and St Pancras, in North London at the general election.He was forced to rule himself out of the race to be Labour leader following a social media campaign urging him to stand.He said he was ""flattered"" by the campaign but the party needed someone with ""more political experience"".The older brother of ex-leader Ed, David Miliband was frontrunner to replace Gordon Brown in 2010, until his sibling beat him by a whisker.A former foreign secretary and MP for South Shields, he was the Blairite choice for leader but eventually quit Parliament to become head of the International Rescue Committee charity in New York in 2013.Speaking to the BBC from the US on the Monday after the general election, Mr Miliband criticised his brother's campaign in the 2015 general election, saying he and Mr Brown had ""allowed themselves to be portrayed as moving backwards from the principles of aspiration and inclusion that are the absolute heart of any successful progressive political project"".While he acknowledged the two men were ""brothers for life"", he also confirmed he was not eligible to stand for the party leadership as he is not an MP.Labour's election rulesMPs wishing to stand as leader and deputy leader have to be nominated by 15% of their colleagues in the Parliamentary Labour Party to be eligible to stand.As Labour now has 232 MPs, this means prospective candidates must get at least 34 signatures. That means the maximum size of any field is six contenders.Under rules agreed last year, all Labour Party members, registered supporters and affiliated supporters - including union members - will be allowed a maximum of one vote each on a one member, one vote system. When the election is held, they will be asked to rank candidates in order of preference.If no candidate gets 50% of all votes cast, the votes will be added up and the candidate with the fewest votes eliminated. Their 2nd preference votes will then be redistributed until one candidate has 50% of all votes cast."

Until that is the Conservative Party did - achieving what had seemed to be Mission Impossible - a Tory majority.Until that is David Cameron's personal triumph which triggered the near simultaneous resignation of his three principle opponents - Messrs Miliband, Clegg and Farage.They did so in part because they helped to crush their partners in coalition these last five years - reducing the Liberal Democrat parliamentary party to a size when it can fit into two London taxis and still have two seats to spare.In part because the extraordinary tidal wave of support for the SNP swept dozens of once safe Labour seats away.In part because Nigel Farage persuaded millions to vote for him but secured just one seat - not, though, the one he was standing in.Read more from Nick Robinson hereThe question uppermost in the prime minister's mind as he assembles his new government is how to keep the kingdom united.""Above all I want to bring our country together,"" he revealed after the result, ""to reclaim a mantle we should never have lost - the mantle of one nation, one United Kingdom"".Looking at the political landscape from Land's End today is very different to the view from John O'Groats.A sea of Conservative and Unionist blue dominates the scene across much of England, while a field of SNP nationalist yellow stretches to the horizon and beyond from the north.David Cameron's greatest challenge is to prevent the union he supports being torn apart by mutual resentment - resentment from Scotland at a Westminster government dominated by English Tories, and resentment from England at the preferential treatment people think is being given to the Scots.Those who assumed the future of the Union had been safeguarded by the Scottish referendum must think again.Read more from Mark Easton hereOne thing is rock-solid true: the Conservatives who worked on this campaign are as surprised by the result as the pollsters, pundits, politicians and general population.Maybe they shouldn't be - the economy is in good shape and the Conservatives had incumbency advantage.But when I travelled back from the prime minister's last rally with a group of exhausted Conservative campaign officials it was clear that 290 seats was a hoped-for target.No-one talked about anything over 300 seats, and no-one even mentioned an overall majority.So what special sauce pushed David Cameron into No 10 with a Commons majority?Mr Cameron had two simple messages in the campaign and he rarely veered away from them; the first - the economy is in good shape and the recovery is threatened by Labour. And the second - the SNP would hold a Labour-led government to ransom.Read more from Jonny Dymond hereBrian Taylor, BBC political editor, ScotlandOf all the comments on the overnight apocalypse, undoubtedly the most straightforward came from a defeated Scottish Labour MP.Since there were quite a few of them, let me narrow the focus a little. Come on down, Tom Harris.Mr Harris had plainly anticipated defeat. Nonetheless, he looked suitably lugubrious as his fate was confirmed.Why, he was asked eagerly, had Labour lost? ""Because we did not win enough votes.""Psephologically, it is perfect. Complete in itself. Psychologically, it sums up Labour's gloom without descending into subsidiary matters such as leadership, strategy and the rest. As a forward-thinking strategy, it is ideal. Win more votes. Simple.Read more from Brian Taylor hereThis has been an election which may have more profound consequences than almost any in living memory.We now face a generational decision about our future in Europe, with an EU referendum in two years' time almost certain.There will also be serious questions about the future of the Union, following an SNP landslide that has turned Scotland into a virtual one-party state.David Cameron's victory also represents a colossal achievement.Only once before in recent history has an incumbent government increased its majority - and that was Mrs Thatcher in her prime in the 1980s.It is also a significant personal victory for Mr Cameron and a rebuff for those in his party who had become increasingly sceptical about his ability to win.But while it may represent a defeat for those Tories who saw this election as a potential opportunity to rid themselves of David Cameron, he must now govern with a wafer-thin majority.For the SNP, their stunning victory can only increase the pressure on Nicola Sturgeon to include a commitment to a second independence referendum in her party's manifesto for next year's Scottish elections.It is an election which has not just defied all the predictions of the pollsters and pundits - but which may yet prompt the most fundamental re-casting of British politics for a generation.Read more from Norman Smith hereAfter an extraordinary night, some brief conclusions:Read more from James Landale hereIs this the end of the union?That is the question many people will be asking this morning after the party which has fought for Scottish independence for 80 years swept to victory.The answer from the jubilant Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon is a firm ""No"".She insists that her MPs will speak for all of Scotland, not just for the 45% who voted for the country to leave the United Kingdom last September.In the closing hours of the most extraordinary election campaign which anyone in Scotland can remember, Ms Sturgeon turned to talk of ""legitimacy.""That will be her watchword in the coming days as she argues that the prime minister cannot ignore the democratic will of the Scottish people.Politically, Scotland and England this morning look and feel like very different countries.Read more from James Cook hereAfter weeks of chatter about an election too close to call, it wasn't that close at all.David Cameron will be continuing as our prime minister.So, what is all this likely to mean?A referendum on whether the UK stays in, or leaves, the European Union, within the next two-and-a-half years.A race to be the next leader of the Labour Party.A race to be the next leader of the Liberal Democrats.And a huge new presence of Scottish National Party MPs at Westminster.And so here's another thing we know for certain this morning: Politics ain't going to be boring any time soon.Read more from Chris Mason hereFor Labour the story of their terrible night is rapidly turning into the search for a new leader. So who will that be?Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, is almost certain to run.  Even before this election, both he and another almost inevitable candidate, Chuka Umunna, had raised eyebrows inside the party at the work they had put in, preparing the ground with members and the unions for potential bids.Yvette Cooper, before the election, was still thought not to have made up her mind over whether to run. That decision has been made perhaps a little easier as her husband, Ed Balls, has lost his seat.She is certainly potentially in the frame, along with two lesser known names - Liz Kendall and Dan Jarvis - two MPs who were only elected in 2010 for the first time. This could be their moment. But whoever is in the job, they face a monumental task.Read Laura Kuenssberg's Twitter hereSterling is up (the most for seven years against the euro), share prices are up (especially bank shares like Lloyds and RBS, and energy shares such as Centrica), government bond prices are up.To state the obvious, investors love the Tories' general election victory.There are a few reasons.One (no surprise here) is that Labour's threat of breaking up banks and imposing energy price caps has been lifted.Second is that investors have been discounting days and weeks of wrangling after polling day over who would form the government - and so they are semi-euphoric that we already know who's in charge.Third, many investors tend to be economically conservative and instinctively Conservative.But although the City may be a bit drunk on the result, its pleasure in Ed Miliband's and Ed Balls' humiliation may be making it a bit blind - perhaps dangerously so - to some bumps in the economic road ahead.Read more from Robert Peston hereNigel Farage dreamed of holding the balance of power, but in the end his UKIP party is now worse off than when it came into the election.At the seventh time of asking he was rejected - this time by the people of Thanet South. It was a similar story in Rochester and Strood where Mark Reckless, who sensationally defected from the Tories last year, was also sent packing.In seats on UKIP's target list, like Thurrock in Essex, the party failed to make gains. In Grimsby - where Mr Farage went twice in the last six weeks - they came third.UKIP got around four million votes - with especially strong showings in north-east and south-east England - but it's ended up with just one MP, and a vacancy at the top. This has led to UKIP attacking the current system of choosing MPs, which it's described as ""busted"" and ""dysfunctional"".In one sense, this campaign was a complete failure and it's left an aftermath of angry voters, and others wondering if the UKIP bubble has burst.Read Robin Brant's Twitter hereI monitored 91 GB-wide voting intention polls during the 2015 election campaign and found nothing in them to prepare me for the final outcome.The good news for the pollsters was that their share for the Lib Dems was pretty close, as were the shares for UKIP, the Greens and the catch-all category of Others.The bad news for the polling industry was that the crucial shares for Conservative and Labour were the ones where they came most adrift.When all the qualifications of margins of error are allowed, there did appear to be a systematic overstatement of the Labour share and an equally systematic understatement of the Conservative one.It is for the pollsters to decide whether to conduct a review of their performance but I trust they will avoid the initial knee-jerk reaction of the immediate aftermath of the 1992 polls debacle.This general election performance follows the performance of the polls in the 2014 Scottish referendum where the choice was simply binary and yet all the polls were out by between 4-6%.Something is wrong. A lot of us would like to know what it is.Read more from David Cowling hereThe words ""political earthquake"" have been translated into numerous European languages, making front page news across the continent.While Britons now examine the domestic minutiae of the election result, here in mainland Europe the vote means one thing: a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU. And that has the potential to create an earthquake of its own.The guardian of the EU treaties Mr Cameron wants to change - Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker - has said again he'd listen to what Britain's new government proposed.Read more from Katya Adler here"

2015-05-30,"EU referendum: What, when and why?",https://web.archive.org//web/20150531005125/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"The UK is set to have a referendum by the end of 2017 on whether or not to remain a member of the European Union.The Conservatives' election manifesto promised to hold a referendum (a nationwide vote) on whether or not the UK should stay in or leave the European Union. They won the election so it's all systems go.A referendum is basically a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part, normally giving a ""Yes"" or ""No"" answer to a question. Whichever side gets more than half of all votes cast is considered to have won.The European Union is an economic and political partnership between 28 European countries. It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, its own parliament and it now sets the rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things like mobile phone charges.The one thing we know for sure is that Prime Minister David Cameron has said it will happen by the end of 2017. The most likely times of the year for referendums are generally May or September, and some people think it should be held as soon as possible - possibly even in May 2016, to coincide with elections in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and London, rather than waiting for 2017. When David Cameron announced in January 2013 his pledge to hold a referendum, a key element was that he would seek to make changes to the way the European Union works - or at least the rules covering the UK as a European Union member. Only once this renegotiation of British membership had been completed would he put the new arrangement to the public vote.During the election the Lib Dems and Labour both said they did not want a referendum unless there were plans to transfer more powers from the UK to the EU. Labour has since dropped its opposition, so the Conservatives are expected to get their Referendum Bill passed easily. The House of Lords could delay it, but as the referendum was promised in the Conservative election manifesto (a manifesto is a document setting out what a party would do if they won the election) it is not likely to reject the bill once MPs back it.The question is always crucial in any referendum and there is already debate about what it should be. The 2013 suggestion from the Conservatives was: ""Do you think that the United Kingdom should remain a member of the European Union?"" Some people thought this phrasing leaned too far towards the status quo - the current state of affairs - and the Electoral Commission, which has to approve the question, said it was not clear enough and proposed:""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union?""Read more: Does the wording of a referendum question matter?British, Irish and Commonwealth citizens over 18 who are resident in the UK, along with UK nationals who have lived overseas for less than 15 years. Members of the House of Lords and Commonwealth citizens in Gibraltar will also be eligible, unlike in a general election. Citizens from EU countries - apart from Ireland, Malta and Cyprus - will not get a vote.Mr Cameron is not revealing the full details of what he wants from the other EU leaders ahead of negotiations - but he is expected to demand an opt-out from one of its core principles of forging an ""ever-closer union"" between member states. He will also try to get restrictions on welfare benefits - in particular, tax credits - for migrants and more powers to block or opt out of new EU laws.Read more: Q&A: What Britain wants from EuropeBritain had a referendum in 1975 shortly after it had joined the EU, or the Common Market as it was then called. The country voted to stay in then but there have been growing calls, from the public and politicians, for another vote because, they argue, the EU has changed a lot over the past 40 years, with many more countries joining and the organisation extending its control over more aspects of daily lives. David Cameron initially resisted these calls but in 2013 he changed his mind.About 33% of the British public, according to the latest opinion polls. The UK Independence Party, which won the last European elections, and received nearly four million votes, 13% of those cast, in May's general election, campaigns for Britain's exit from the EU. A fair number of Conservative MPs - and several Labour ones - are also thought to be strongly in favour of leaving.They believe Britain is being held back by the EU, which they say imposes too many rules on business and charges billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also want Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. They also object to the idea of ""ever closer union"" and the belief that the ultimate goal is to create a ""United States of Europe"".David Cameron wants Britain to stay in the EU, once he has got some powers back from it. He has so far refused to say whether he would start calling for Britain to leave if he does not get what he wants from the other EU leaders. The Labour Party, SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems are also in favour of staying in. Latest opinion polls suggest 45% of the British public agree with them.They believe Britain gets a big boost from EU membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argue, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also believe Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving.It depends which way you look at it - or what you believe is important. Leaving the EU would be a big step - arguably far more important than who wins the next general election - but would it set the nation free or condemn it to economic ruin? Here is a rundown of the arguments for and against.Big business - with a few exceptions - tends to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. The CBI president and BT chief Sir Mike Rake says there are ""no credible alternatives"" to staying in the EU. But others disagree, such as Lord Bamford, chairman of JCB, who says an EU exit would allow the UK to negotiate trade deals as our country ""rather than being one of 28 nations"". Many small- and medium-sized firms would welcome a cut in red tape and what they see as petty regulations, but a lot hangs on what deal Mr Cameron renegotiates. The British Chambers of Commerce says 55% of members back staying in a reformed EU.Find out more: Business for Britain wants big changes to the UK's relations with the EU and says the UK should be prepared to vote to leave if the changes are not achievedBusiness for New Europe is a coalition of business leaders who support the UK's membership of the EU and ""oppose withdrawal to the margins"".The Electoral Commission will be in charge of making sure it's a fair contest.  There will be official ""Yes"" and ""No"" campaigns, selected by the Commission, which will have to abide by strict spending limits. Anyone wanting to launch their own Yes or No campaign will have to register with the Commission if they plan to spend more than £10,000. They must be UK-based. The Commission says MPs should decide what kinds of organisations should be allowed to take part. Business groups, trade unions and pressure groups are all likely to want to have their say.There will also be rules to prevent organisations trying to get round the spending limits through multiple registrations. Political parties will also be allowed to campaign for the result they want to see.Anyone who runs an unregistered campaign will be limited to spending less than £10,000. The idea is to prevent wealthy foreigners, companies or governments trying to influence the outcome. The Electoral Commission has published preliminary guidelines.That is yet to be decided and will partly depend on what Mr Cameron achieves in his renegotiation of the terms of the UK's membership of the EU. He says he is confident he can get what he wants, in which case he would be expected to lead the ""staying in"" side. The highest profile supporter of leaving the EU is UKIP leader Nigel Farage, but there are likely to be other high profile politicians who support withdrawal - or, as with the anti-euro campaign a few years back, celebrities or business people could front an ""anti-politics"" campaign.Conservatives' election manifesto - including referendum pledgeTry these features:How to win a referendumWhat David Cameron wants from the EU negotiationsTimeline: Campaigns for a European Union referendumBusinesses give their views on a possible EU exit"
2015-05-30,What Britain wants from Europe,https://web.archive.org//web/20150531005125/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32695399,"David Cameron says he has a mandate to pursue EU reform following the Conservatives' general election victory. The PM, who will be hoping his majority government will give him extra leverage in Brussels, wants to renegotiate the terms of the UK's membership ahead of a referendum by the end of 2017. He has said he will campaign for Britain to remain in the EU if he gets the reforms he wants.Mr Cameron has said he does not want to reveal full details of his negotiating hand but he has given a broad indication, in a series of speeches and newspaper articles, of his priorities when he goes into talks with other EU leaders.These are: The prime minister has said Britain would resist any move towards a European Army and that he wants to free British police forces from EU interference. He has also ruled out Britain joining the euro.But he has placed less emphasis in recent years on demanding changes to EU social policy, such as the maximum 48-hour working week, agency workers, maternity leave and non-discrimination rules.The official UK government position is that a referendum will be held by the end of 2017 but Downing Street sources have said: ""If we can do it earlier we will.""There is speculation David Cameron is planning to hold the vote in 2016 to avoid a clash with French and German elections in 2017.The prime minister wants treaty change but even if the referendum was held in 2017 there may not be enough time to legally incorporate any reforms into a treaty and it would have to be done at a later stage.An early referendum would anger Eurosceptics who believe it would not allow enough time to make the case for exit or negotiate any meaningful concessions.""A rushed process would severely undermine the chances to secure a significant deal that both British business and voters could support and would waste the opportunity of a lifetime,"" Matthew Elliott, chief executive of Business for Britain told Breitbart London.The question is always crucial in any referendum and there is already a debate about what it should be. The Draft European Union (Referendum) Bill, published by the Conservatives in 2013, proposed this form of words: ""Do you think that the United Kingdom should remain a member of the European Union?""Some thought that leaned too far towards the status quo, encouraging a yes vote, and the Electoral Commission said it was not clear and direct enough. The watchdog proposed this form of words instead: ""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union?""The new Conservative government will attempt to repeal the Human Rights Act, which requires UK courts to treat the European Court of Human Rights as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. The European Court of Human Rights is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe (CoE), which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine.The freedom for people to move around Europe, enshrined in the EU treaties, works in parallel with the other three basic freedoms in the single market: freedom of goods, capital and services.It is likely to be a ""red line"" for other EU leaders, who do not want to see it eroded.Mr Cameron has steered clear of tackling it directly - for example by asking for an emergency ""brake"" on free movement, or a cap on numbers - focusing instead on reducing the incentive provided by welfare payments. In a speech last November, David Cameron set out measures to reduce the number of EU nationals moving to the UK.His main proposals were:Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission, has said he is ready to work with Mr Cameron to ""strike a fair deal for the United Kingdom in the EU"". The leaders of other EU nations have previously warned they are unlikely to support major changes to EU treaties to accommodate British demands. But Mr Cameron's general election victory may have given him extra leverage. ""The ball is very much in the court of the UK now,"" a senior EU official told The Guardian. ""It's up to the British to define what they want."" The key figure will be German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is very keen to keep Britain in the EU but has so far been unwilling to make major concessions to enable that to happen. There are fears that a ""pick and mix"" approach to EU treaties would undermine EU cohesion.Mr Cameron has said there is ""no doubt"" his planned reforms will require changes to the treaties governing the European Union. But this would require the unanimous support of all EU members, and may not be possible within the deadline he has set of a referendum before the end of 2017. Any attempt to change EU laws on free movement would meet fierce resistance from some EU nations, particularly Eastern European states. Mr Juncker has said free movement is non-negotiable.Mr Cameron may find it difficult to get unanimous support for his proposals for a four-year waiting period for migrant workers claiming UK benefits. East European EU members would be likely to oppose this, on the grounds that it would discriminate against their citizens.  Attempts to secure opt-outs for the City are unlikely to go down well with other European leaders.However, there are precedents for EU treaty changes to accommodate some countries' specific concerns - for example, the protocol attached to the Lisbon Treaty for Ireland.Mr Cameron has faced repeated calls to say whether he would campaign for Britain's exit from the EU in the referendum if he fails to get what he wants from the renegotiation process. All he has said is that he will ""rule nothing out"". Some Conservative MPs want Britain to leave the EU no matter what David Cameron manages to renegotiate. A larger group are likely to want more concessions than Mr Cameron has so far indicated he is prepared to demand.Senior backbencher David Davis, who was defeated by Mr Cameron for the Tory leadership in 2005, told the Daily Telegraph the majority of the 332 Conservative MPs want Mr Cameron to negotiate an ""opt-out"" power to stop individual EU laws from applying to Britain. The prime minister has said this would be ""impossible"" without Britain leaving the EU.Mr Davis claims as many as 60 Tory MPs would be prepared to rebel and vote for Britain's exit from the EU if the prime minister fails to deliver.Graham Brady, chairman of the Tory backbench 1922 committee, which represents backbenchers, has urged David Cameron to give all Conservative MPs, including ministers, a free vote in the EU referendum.In January, Mr Cameron warned that serving cabinet ministers would have to quit the government if they wanted to campaign to leave the EU if he had secured the reforms to it he wants.In the 1975 referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Economic Community, as the EU was then called, Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson decided to suspend collective responsibility because his cabinet was split on the issue. Ministers were allowed to vote with their consciences and campaign against each other. The majority of them, including Mr Wilson, joined the Yes camp, but left-wingers, such as Tony Benn, played a leading role in the No campaign. The Yes campaign won easily with 67% of the vote."
2015-05-30,UK and the EU: Better off out or in?,https://web.archive.org//web/20150531005125/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32793642,"David Cameron has promised a referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Union by the end of 2017. Here is a summary of the key arguments for and against British membership.If Britain votes to leave the EU, it will have to negotiate a new trading relationship with what would now be a 27 member organisation, to allow British firms to sell goods and services to EU countries without being hit by excessive tariffs and other restrictions.Better off out: Britain could negotiate an ""amicable divorce"", but retain strong trading links with EU nations, say those campaigning for Britain's exit. There are several potential scenarios:Better off in: An ""amicable divorce"" is a pipe dream, pro-EU campaigners argue. France, Germany and other leading EU nations would never allow Britain a ""pick and mix"" approach to the bloc's rules. Norway and Switzerland have to abide by many EU rules without any influence over how they are formed. Negotiating a comprehensive free trade agreement could take years and have an uncertain outcome. And if Britain went for a completely clean break with the EU its exports would be subject to tariffs and would still have to meet EU production standards, harming the competitiveness of British business.The run-up to the EU referendum is likely to be dominated by competing claims about how many millions of jobs will be lost or gained by Britain's exit. All such claims come with a health warning. Coming up with a precise figure is difficult as there is no way of knowing if threats by foreign companies to scale back their operations in the UK would come to pass or, indeed, how many jobs would be created by the reshaped economy that might emerge in the wake of an exit.Better off out: There would be a jobs boom as firms are freed from EU regulations and red tape, say those arguing for an exit, with small- and medium-sized companies who don't trade with the EU benefiting the most. In its recent paper, the EU Jobs Myth, the free market Institute for Economic Affairs seeks to debunk the claim that 3-4 million jobs would be lost if Britain left. ""Jobs are associated with trade, not membership of a political union, and there is little evidence to suggest that trade would substantially fall between British businesses and European consumers in the event the UK was outside the EU,"" it argues. ""The UK labour market is incredibly dynamic, and would adapt quickly to changed relationships with the EU.""Better off in: Millions of jobs would be lost as global manufacturers moved to lower-cost EU countries. Britain's large, foreign-owned car industry would be particularly at risk. ""The attractiveness of the UK as a place to invest and do automotive business is clearly underpinned by the UK's influential membership of the EU,"" said a KPMG report on the car industry last year. The financial services sector, which employs about 2.1 million people in the UK, also has concerns about a British exit. ""The success of the UK financial services industry is to a large extent built on EU Internal Market legislation. To abandon this for some untried, unknown and unpredictable alternative would carry very significant risks,"" said global law firm Clifford Chance in a report by think tank TheCityUK last year.Much would depend on the trade deals Britain managed to negotiate with the EU and rest of the world after its exit. The best-case scenario, according to think tank Open Europe, is that the UK would be better off by 1.6% of GDP a year by 2030. That is assuming the UK carried out widespread deregulation after its exit and managed to strike favourable trade deals. The think tank adds: ""A far more realistic range is between a 0.8% permanent loss to GDP in 2030 and a 0.6% permanent gain in GDP in 2030, in scenarios where Britain mixes policy approaches"".The Centre for Economic Performance, at the London School of Economics, says the worst-case scenario is a 6.3% to 9.5% reduction in GDP, ""a loss of a similar size to that resulting from the global financial crisis of 2008/09"". The best case, according to their analysis, is a loss of 2.2% of GDP.Better off out: Britain would regain full control of its borders. UKIP wants to see a work permit system introduced, so that EU nationals would face the same visa restrictions as those from outside the EU, which it says would reduce population growth from current levels of 298,000 a year to about 50,000. This would create job opportunities for British workers and boost wages, as well as easing pressure on schools, hospitals and other public services. Better off in: Britain might have to agree to allow free movement of EU migrants as the price of being allowed access to the free market. In any case, immigration from the rest of the EU has been good for Britain's economy. The UK's growth forecasts are based, in part, on continued high levels of net migration. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility says the economy relies on migrant labour and taxes paid by immigrants to keep funding public services.The UK's net contribution to the EU, taking into account the rebate, was £11.3bn in 2013. That is more than four times what it was in 2008. It is about the same amount as the UK government spends on transport every year.Better off out: The UK would save billions in membership fees, and end the ""hidden tariff"" paid by UK taxpayers when goods are exported to the EU, caused by red tape, waste, fraud and other factors. Better off in: The UK's contribution to the EU budget is a drop in the ocean compared with the benefits to business of being in the single market. Better off out: The EU is not as important to British trade as it used to be, and continuing turmoil in the eurozone will make it even less so. Even if Britain did not manage to negotiate a free trade deal with the EU it would not be as disastrous as EU-enthusiasts claim, argues economist Roger Bootle in his book The Trouble with Europe: ""It would place the UK in the same position as the US is currently in, along with India, China and Japan, all of which manage to export to the EU relatively easily."" The UK would be free to establish bilateral trade agreements with fast-growing export markets such as China, Singapore, Brazil, Russia and India through the World Trade Organisation. Better off in: The EU is the UK's main trading partner, worth more than £400bn a year, or 52% of the total trade in goods and services. Complete withdrawal from the EU would see trade barriers erected, with car exports to the EU, for example, facing a 15% tariff and imports a tariff of 10%.  ""The idea that the UK would be freer outside the EU is based on a series of misconceptions, that a medium-sized, open economy could hold sway in an increasingly fractured trading system dominated by the US, the EU and China; that the EU makes it harder for Britain to penetrate emerging markets; and that foreign capital would be more attracted to Britain's economy if it were no longer part of the single market,"" the pro-EU Centre for European Reform said in a recent report.Better off out: The UK would remain a key part of Nato and the UN Security Council and a nuclear power, with a powerful global voice in its own right. The Eurosceptic Bruges Group wants an end to the ""discredited"" principle that Britain acts as a transatlantic bridge between the US and Europe, saying the country should make self-reliance its guiding principle.Better off in: Stripped of influence in Brussels, Berlin and Paris, Britain would find itself increasingly ignored by Washington and sidelined on big transnational issues such as the environment, security and trade. America and other allies want Britain to remain in the EU. The UK risks becoming a maverick, isolated state if it leaves.Better off out: Britain would gain full control of its own borders, with migration in and out of the country regulated solely by British law. It would be more difficult for EU citizens to move to the UK, although those already living here are unlikely to be removed. Better off in: A lot would depend on what kind of deal was reached with the other EU nations. Britons may have to apply for visas to enter EU countries and those already living there may face integration rules, such as proving they can speak the language before gaining long-term residency rights. There would also be uncertainty for many EU workers now paying taxes in the UK - what benefits, if any, would they be entitled to?Better off out: The EU has limited power over tax, which is largely a matter for national governments. The exception is VAT, which has bands agreed at the EU level. Outside the EU, the UK would potentially have more flexibility.Better off in:  ""Tax avoidance and evasion will reach crippling levels as our economy becomes increasingly wholly owned by foreign multinationals that make tax avoidance in Britain central to their business strategy,"" argued the pro-European The Observer newspaper in an editorial.Better off out: It would be a major shot in the arm for British democracy as the Westminster parliament regained its sovereignty and reconnected with voters. The country would be free from the European Arrest Warrant and other law and order measures.Better off in: Britons benefit from EU employment laws and social protections, which would be stripped away. Withdrawal from the European Arrest Warrant could mean delays for the UK in extraditing suspects from other European countries; and the UK already has some opt-outs from EU labour law, including the Working Time Directive."
2015-05-30,Whistle-stop tour,https://web.archive.org//web/20150531005125/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-32942086,"There was a lot of talk of shuttle diplomacy this week and of David Cameron's ""whistle-stop tour of Europe"", but in the end the British prime minister actually only popped in to four European capitals between Thursday morning and Friday afternoon.So did the trip merit the fanfare? Was it a success?Well, when the most powerful woman in the world (that is, Angela Merkel) responds to the prime minister's wish-list for a different kind of EU with ""where there's a will there's a way"" and says that, yes, treaty change might indeed be possible - that must sound like success to him. The European tour this week served a definite purpose. In the long run-up to the UK general election, David Cameron and his ministers irritated a fair few by grandstanding and performing to the Eurosceptic gallery at home while abroad on EU business.This was a chance to try to repair burned bridges.Before the nitty-gritty and sometimes probably nasty process of negotiating a new EU relationship for Britain, this was a chance for the prime minister to say to other leaders: ""Look, this is not about the UK versus the rest of Europe. We do have a lot in common.""What Europe's leaders want to feel from Britain as its seeks to change the EU is that this is a process, not a diktat. In this pre-negotiation stage, tone is as important as content. So, in Paris, Mr Cameron carefully listed issues where France and Britain stand side-by-side; while in the Netherlands, he described the country as an old friend and like-minded ally. Mr Cameron needs other EU leaders onside to pass meaningful reforms.This week's four tour stops were carefully chosen. The Netherlands and Germany are generally UK-friendly: open to more competitiveness, a stronger single market and less red tape. France is trickier but, alongside Germany, a traditional EU heavyweight - and therefore a must-visit - while Poland is the emerging new EU power. It is Britain's ally over tough sanctions against Russia but, as we saw in the rather uncomfortable meeting with Prime Minister Ewa Kopacz on Friday, Poland will be a fierce opponent of scrapping migrant benefits. On his travels David Cameron found a widespread appetite for change. The tricky part will be persuading other EU leaders that his way is the best way.But when it comes to the EU's most powerful country, Germany, the details of this trip were less important.Chancellor Merkel, ever the pragmatist, has an eye on the big picture - Europe on the world stage. She worries that the EU without the British economy, the British military and British diplomatic expertise is weaker and more fragmented in the face of a ruthlessly ambitious China and, in particular, having grown up in communist East Germany, of a newly aggressive Russia just next door.Angela Merkel, normally so risk averse, was uncharacteristically outspoken standing side-by-side with David Cameron.""I want to find a solution,"" she said to him.And generally in the EU, when Germany speaks, others follow. "
2015-05-30,Seeing eye-to-eye?,https://web.archive.org//web/20150531005125/http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-eu-32929957,"""David Cameron has to be realistic,"" said Poland's Europe Minister Rafal Trzaskowski, ""and I'm sure he will be"".It is a message Mr Cameron will hear repeated in capitals across the continent as he sets out on his campaign to renegotiate the UK's role in the European Union. After a brief breakfast meeting with his Polish counterpart Ewa Kopacz, at a former royal palace in Warsaw, the British prime minister will be in no doubt about Poland's position.Any British attempt to restrict the rights of migrant workers from other EU countries while they are in the UK will be resisted. Abuse of the welfare system is a different matter. On that issue, progress can and will be made. But suggestions that Mr Cameron might seek to prevent other EU citizens claiming in-work benefits such as tax credits are seen as unacceptable.""We can't accept discrimination,"" Mr Trzaskowski said, ""it's a red line"".There are other issues, though, on which Poland and the UK clearly see eye-to-eye. After Mr Cameron's meeting with Mrs Kopacz, a Downing Street spokesperson said: ""There was much they could agree on - making Europe more competitive by strengthening the single market, cutting back red tape, ensuring fairness between euro-ins and euro-outs and more subsidiarity, respecting the sovereignty of member states.""The Poles will welcome British efforts to guarantee that the interests of EU countries outside the eurozone are protected. The notion that national parliaments should play a more active role in assessing EU legislation will also find favour. But the big political change in Poland this week has not been in parliament but in the presidency. The conservative Andrzej Duda has - rather surprisingly - been elected president, after gaining strong support from a younger generation of voters.  Mr Duda was the candidate of the Law and Justice Party, which belongs to the same political group as the British Conservatives in the European Parliament. ""We are strongly against building an artificial European federal state,"" Jaroslaw Sellin from Law and Justice told me. ""We need to co-operate as independent countries within the EU, and the main focus should always be on the economy."" In other words there is plenty of political opinion in Poland that David Cameron can appeal to. But British renegotiation needs to be based on the idea of working together, not on dictating terms - that won't work, in Warsaw or elsewhere. David Cameron is starting renegotiation of the terms of Britain's EU membership ahead of a referendum. Here is some further reading on what it all means: What Britain wants from EuropeThe UK and the EU: Better off in or out?EU reform: What's in it for the others?"
2015-05-30,UKIP v Labour,https://web.archive.org//web/20150531005125/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32928391,"The fight between Labour and UKIP is heading to Wales. Nigel Farage's party is challenging in seats where Labour traditionally dominate at the general election, and it could be on course for electoral success there within the year.Voters in Caerphilly have always elected Labour MPs. But on 7 May this was one of 120 constituencies where UKIP came second, and soon there will be another election here on terms likely to suit Nigel Farage's party.Professor Roger Scully, of Cardiff University, tells BBC Radio 4's the World at One that at the moment UKIP are on course to win six or seven seats in the Welsh Assembly next year.The campaign here will be one of the first jobs on the to-do list of a new Labour leader, and will pose a fundamental question: what should Labour do about the threat from UKIP?The voting system for the Assembly election next year combines first-past-the-post contests and proportional representation, giving smaller parties like UKIP a much better chance than in Westminster contests.Sam Gould was UKIP's candidate in Caerphilly at the general election, winning almost a fifth of the vote, its most improved result in Wales.A former Labour voter, he has only joined UKIP in the last year. A few months ago the party had no presence in the town.Showing me around the Lansbury Park estate there, he says: ""We've only been organised as a party for a matter of three months and so for us to get to 20% of the vote after only organising ourselves and running a three month campaign is tremendous. So what can we do in a year?""There has never been a rush to vote Tory in much of south east Wales. The legacy of mines long since closed still marks the landscape, politics and cultural identity of the area. But Professor Scully says that doesn't guarantee an unchanging allegiance to the Labour party.He says: ""There was an element of the Labour vote in the South Wales valleys, an element of sort of socially conservative working class voters in much of Wales, that was unenthusiastic Labour and that was ready and waiting you might say for UKIP to come along and try to attract them.""You might think that a deeply worrying analysis for the Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones. Yet he appears far from panicked, instead suggesting other parties will suffer at UKIP's hands.He says: ""All the opinion polls seem to suggest that the seats would come from other parties not from us, bearing in mind we have 30 out of the 60 seats and 28 of them are first past the post.  ""In terms of losing seats in the proportional representation section, actually it's other parties that would lose the seats other than ourselves.""Labour's near-wipe-out in Scotland is recent, raw and devastating. It seemed unthinkable, until it happened. Wales' politics are very different; neither UKIP nor the Welsh nationalists Plaid Cymru have enjoyed an SNP-like surge. But after its Scottish trauma Labour must wonder whether the party in Wales - and its leader - accused by opponents of taking traditional support for granted and facing fresh threats, could suffer a similar fate.The Welsh First Minister says the possibility is ""always there in the forefront of our minds"".But he adds: ""We wanted to make sure that people saw us as a party that would stand up for Wales, a party that was devolutionist in its outlook while at the same time not a party that supported independence and that was the basis for our success in 2011. ""In Scotland I get the impression that Scottish Labour went the other way and left that contested ground to the SNP. It's not a mistake that we're going to make.""He suggests Labour's leaders in Scotland made errors that he has already managed to avoid. His analysis will be tested by voters in Wales next May. With Scottish and London Mayoral and Assembly elections due on the same day, it could be a moment to help demonstrate whether Labour has learned how to win back voters, or whether it has been abandoned by some of its traditional supporters for good."
2015-05-30,Legal challenge,https://web.archive.org//web/20150531005125/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-32930228,"An online appeal to raise funds for a legal challenge to the election of Orkney and Shetland MP Alistair Carmichael has raised more than £42,000 in four days.The People Versus Carmichael was launched on crowdfunding site Indiegogo by ""residents of Orkney and Shetland who are disappointed in the behaviour of their MP and want our politics conducted honestly and without smears"".Its stated goal is to ""raise an election petition in the courts"". It says: ""This could begin a process which could have the recent result in Orkney and Shetland overturned."" Mr Carmichael has been the Liberal Democrat MP for Orkney and Shetland since 2001. Before the general election he was Scottish secretary, a cabinet minister in the UK government.It was a position of power and influence that gave him access to confidential government documents.On 3 April, during the election campaign, the Daily Telegraph reported a leaked memo which gave an account of a private conversation between Nicola Sturgeon and the French Ambassador which suggested that the SNP leader wanted Tory leader David Cameron to remain prime minister.Ms Sturgeon denied the account and demanded an inquiry into the leak. The Cabinet Office inquiry concluded that Mr Carmichael and his special advisor Euan Roddin were responsible for the leak. When asked about the leak at the time, Carmichael said: ""The first I heard of this was when I received a phone call from a journalist"".In a letter of apology, Mr Carmichael said: ""Had I still been a government minister I would have considered this to be a matter that required my resignation. I have therefore informed the Cabinet Secretary that I will decline my ministerial severance payment.""For many this sanction is not enough and they feel he is not fit to be an MP.Those behind the crowdfunding petition says they want to hold Mr Carmichael ""accountable for his behaviour before, during and after the election campaign"".They are hoping to raise enough money for a legal challenge under the Representation of the People Act 1983.It states that electors or disappointed candidates can question the result of a parliamentary election if a candidate or their agents engage in ""corrupt or illegal practices"". The practices set out in the act include bribery (making illegal payments) and paying canvassers.Whether Mr Carmichael's actions are covered by  ""corrupt or illegal practices"" is the matter a court would have to decide.Last month the election of the Mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, was voided for a range of breaches of election law including voting fraud, false statements, bribery and spiritual influence, telling Bengali voters it was their ""religious duty"" to vote for him.However, the case of Labour's Phil Woolas in the 2010 general election is perhaps more relevant.He was removed from his Oldham East and Saddleworth seat for circulating lies about the personal character of his Liberal Democratic opponent during the general election campaign. He was the first MP to lose his seat in this way for almost a century. The specially convened election court ruled that comments in campaign material suggesting Lib Dem candidate Elwyn Watkins had tried to ""woo"" the votes of Muslim extremists clearly amounted to an attack on his personal character and conduct.Section 106 of the Representation of the People Act states that a person who ""makes or publishes any false statement of fact in relation to the candidate's personal character or conduct shall be guilty of an illegal practice, unless he can show that he had reasonable grounds for believing, and did believe, that statement to be true"".Alistair Carmichael, who won the Orkney and Shetland seat with a majority of just 817 votes, says he believed at the time that he authorised the leak that the comments made about Ms Sturgeon in the memo were a true account of her conversation.Christine O'Neill, chairman of Brodies LLP and expert in public law, told BBC Scotland: ""One issue here of course is that the first minister (Nicola Sturgeon) was not a candidate in this election.  ""The false statement must have been made with the aim of influencing the outcome of the election - and in order to see the successful candidate unseated it is also necessary to show that there was an actual impact on the outcome of the election.""There are few election petitions and fewer which are successful.  One of the most recent cases on false statements makes it clear that there is a distinction between saying something false about a candidate's personal conduct and character and making false statements about their political activities or conduct.""In the months before the end of the last parliament the Recall of MPs Act 2015 was given Royal Assent.It allows for a recall petition to be triggered if a MP is sentenced to a prison term or is suspended from the House of Commons for at least 21 sitting days. If 10% of the eligible electors in the MP's constituency signed a petition, the seat would be declared vacant and a by-election would follow. Mr Carmichael has not been convicted of a criminal offence or suspended from the House of Commons so this new law would not apply."
2015-05-30,Claptrap,https://web.archive.org//web/20150531005125/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32913113,"Britain's Parliament has some pretty bizarre rules - as the new intake of SNP MPs found out when they were given a stern warning for clapping during the Queen's Speech debate. So why is applause banned in the Commons?You can wave your order papers, shout until you are purple in the face, hurl abuse across the Chamber, join in with frankly weird displays of mass groaning or that elongated ""hear, hear"" thing they do.But try joining your party comrades in a sincere appreciation of a point well made in the traditional way and you will have Speaker John Bercow on his feet telling you to respect the traditions of the House.At least, that's what the 56 new SNP MPs found on Wednesday, when they broke into applause to support Angus Robertson, their leader at Westminster, who was hitting back at a furious attack on the party by Labour MP Ian Austin.""May I say at the start of the Parliament,"" said Mr Bercow, ""that the convention that we do not clap in this Chamber is very, very long established and widely respected, and it would be appreciated if Members showed some respect for that convention.""They will get their speaking rights from this Chair - of that they can be assured. They will be respected, but I would invite them to show some respect for the traditions of this Chamber of the House of Commons.""But like many other things in Britain's elasticated, unwritten constitution, the no-clapping convention is there to be broken.The most famous occasion was on the 27 July, 2007 when Tony Blair gave his farewell speech to the House of Commons.With wavering voice, the outgoing Labour prime minister admitted he was not really a Commons man, but he respected the place and the ""noble"" profession of politics, and with a final thespian flourish spoke his final words to the Chamber: ""I wish everyone, friend or foe, well and that's that, the end."" A ripple of applause on the Labour benches soon spread across the floor before turning into an unprecedented cross-party standing ovation.  It was an extraordinary scene - and one the then Speaker Michael Martin did nothing to stop.John Bercow himself has not always enforced the no-clapping rule as vigorously as he did on Wednesday.When the previous government mounted a last minute attempt to oust him as Speaker, on the final day of Parliament in March this year, Tory MP and friend of the speaker Charles Walker delivered an emotional speech denouncing what he saw as the underhand tactics of then-chief whip Michael Gove.The Speaker's supporters got to their feet to give Mr Walker a standing ovation.  A clearly overcome Mr Bercow let it go.Making a noise with the hands to show appreciation or disapproval is as old as civilisation itself.In ancient Rome, clapping was part of a repertoire of gestures, including the snapping of the finger and thumb and the flapping of togas, used by audiences at public performances.In French theatre, groups of professional clappers, known as ""claques"", were hired by performers to make them appear more popular with audiences.In politics, the length of the ovation at the end of a speech is sometimes seen as a sign of how well it went down.This took on a more sinister dimension in Soviet Russia, when party leaders would give long speeches with orchestrated applause and ovations.In the book Gulag Archipelago, author Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn recalls how someone toasted Stalin at a local Communist Party conference and ""stormy applause, rising to an ovation"", broke out. The great leader was not present but the applause continued regardless. ""Palms were getting sore and raised arms were already aching... however, who would dare be the first to stop?""So why is applause normally banned in the Commons?There is certainly plenty of claptrap spoken in the House (in the traditional sense of the word, meaning something designed to elicit applause).But MPs and members of the House of Lords are encouraged to find other outlets for their approval, mainly through the shouting of ""hear, hear!"", which started life in the 17th Century as a cry of ""hear him! hear him!"".The rules are laid out in the Parliamentary etiquette bible Erskine May, which says: ""Members must not disturb a Member who is speaking by hissing, chanting, clapping, booing, exclamations or other interruption."" But it adds: ""When not uttered till the end of a sentence, the cry of 'hear, hear,' offers no interruption of the speech."" MPs are well aware of how absurd this can sound to the uninitiated.The modernisation committee, set up by Tony Blair's government in an effort to drag the Commons into the 20th Century, said new MPs found it ""incomprehensible that it is not in order to clap at the end of a speech, a practice which is commonplace in other gatherings and indeed in other Parliaments"".But the committee backed the applause ban in a 1998 report:  ""While we agree that spontaneous clapping at the end of a speech could in no way be interpreted as disturbance of the speaker, there is a danger that such a practice might be open to abuse and could lead in certain circumstances to orchestration of what would amount to standing ovations with the success or failure of a speech being judged not by its content but by the relative length of the ovation at the end.""This might not disrupt an individual speech, but would disrupt the tenor of the debate, as indeed would slow handclapping.""So it looks as if MPs will have to continue sitting on their hands. And the SNP will have to find a new way to show their appreciation."
2015-05-30,Labour's battle,https://web.archive.org//web/20150531005125/http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-32913465,"Former Militant councillor Derek Hatton is attempting to rejoin the Labour Party. But what was Militant, asks Finlo Rohrer.The battle between the Labour Party and its Militant faction was one of the biggest political controversies in British politics in the 1980s. The Militant grouping had grown out of the Revolutionary Socialist League and was widely categorised as Trotskyist. From the mid-1970s its critics claimed it pursued an ""entryist"" policy of attempting to gain key positions within the Labour Party in an effort to promote its policies - including widespread nationalisation and a large programme of public works. Its most notable success was in Liverpool where the local Labour Party - dominated by Militant members - took control of the city council in 1983. Despite being only deputy leader, former firefighter Derek Hatton was seen as effectively in charge.""The best way to think of Militant is to think of Marxist-inspired socialists within the Labour Party,"" says Dr Peter North, author of Militant Liverpool: A City on the Edge.  Liverpool was particularly receptive to Militant's ideas because it had found itself ""on the wrong side of all the changes in global trade"", says North. A move to ""containerisation"" - increased use of shipping containers - was taking traffic away from the port. That and a partly associated decline in heavy industry were exacerbating unemployment and deprivation in the city. Militant started vehement opposition to the Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher, attempting to resist a reduction in the city's grant from central government by setting an illegal budget that allowed for more spending than there was income. ""They were in breach of Labour Party policies,"" says Peter Kilfoyle, a noted opponent of Militant who was a regional organiser for the Labour Party in the 1980s. ""They sought to go illegally against the government of the day when Labour Party policy was not to.""They were a party within a party. Their sole intention was to eat away at the Labour Party from the inside - taking away members and funding. They did it successfully."" Supporters of Militant point to the wave of building it initiated in Liverpool, replacing slum housing and improving sports and other leisure facilities. But the council did not have enough money to pay for its programme, and action by the district auditor was averted only by taking out loans. A move to apparently issue redundancy notices to every single council employee - ostensibly as a negotiating tactic - was widely criticised. Labour leader Neil Kinnock used a conference speech to attack Militant for ""the grotesque chaos of a Labour council hiring taxis to scuttle round a city handing out redundancy notices to its own workers"".In June 1986 Hatton was expelled from the Labour Party after a disciplinary hearing. A number of other politicians and activists were also thrown out. ""The decision was made to get rid of them,"" says Kilfoyle. ""They were in breach of the rules of the Labour Party.""But North argues that Militant were harshly treated. ""My view is that political parties that have a variety of attitudes within them are more democratic and healthy.""How an extreme group of left-wingers took over Liverpool City Council 30 years ago and opposed Margaret Thatcher's central government.

2015-05-31,Childcare system 'facing meltdown',https://web.archive.org//web/20150601103602/http://www.bbc.com/news/education-32928117,"The childcare system in England is at ""breaking point"" due to underfunding and a plan to double free provision could send it into ""meltdown"".That warning - from industry body the Pre-School Learning Alliance - comes as ministers say trials of the new scheme are being brought forward to 2016.It will double the entitlement for working parents of three and four-year-olds from the current 570 hours a year.The government says it is committed to increasing funding. Currently, all three and four-year-olds in England are entitled to 570 hours of free early education or childcare a year, which works out as 15 hours each week for 38 weeks of the year.   The Childcare Bill, announced in last week's Queen's Speech, would double this for working parents with a household income of less than £150,000 - although it is not clear yet how many hours they will have to work in order to qualify.The change had been due to come into force from September 2017, but some working parents will be entitled to the extra help when pilots begin in September next year. However, the Pre-School Learning Alliance - which represents 14,000 private, voluntary and independent groups - says the government grant to childcare providers for the existing 15 hours falls, on average, 20% short of the true cost. A study by specialist research group Ceeda for the alliance suggests providers could lose up to £661 a year for every three and four-year-old in the scheme, if the plan goes ahead at current rates.The alliance said many groups were already having to charge parents extra for hours of childcare not included in the scheme to make ends meet.""I think this is crunch time, I think there will be a meltdown,"" said chief executive Neil Leitch.  ""While we of course welcome the drive to improve the availability of childcare in this country, these figures clearly show the government's plan to extend funded childcare hours simply cannot work without a substantial increase in sector funding.""The so-called 'free' childcare scheme is nothing of the sort. For years now, the initiative has been subsidised by providers and parents because of a lack of adequate government funding."" He continued: ""I think we are at breaking point with just the 15 hours. Extend that to 30 and you will see a different position altogether.""There are many nurseries that can't physically extend their number of hours. They may operate in a church hall or community centre. Nobody has considered whether in fact they will be able to offer the 30 hours."" Linda Symonds, owner of Kidz Kabin nursery in north London, said the shortfall to her business was about 50%. ""The way they have put it across to parents is very misleading. The government is pulling wool over all these families' eyes if they tell them this childcare is free.""At the moment we don't even break even on what they pay us. Unless we make some profit we can't invest and pay staff properly.""   The bill is being introduced to Parliament on Tuesday and a consultation launched on how the policy should work in practice. The cost to the Treasury was initially estimated at £350 million a year, but Employment Minister Priti Patel told the BBC the sums involved were yet to be finalised.Ms Patel, who is the leading the task force charged with implementing the plans, said: ""We are going to be consulting at the outset to ensure that the funding level is right - fair for the providers and also for the taxpayer.""We know that funding rates need to increase.""Asked why households with a relatively high income would receive help, she added: ""This isn't about subsidising well-off people at all. This is about providing affordable childcare and increasing childcare provision for working families.""Ministers say up to 600,000 families could benefit, saving as much as £5,000 a year.  In Scotland, three and four-year-olds are entitled to up to 600 hours of free early years education or childcare a year, while in Wales, provision is for a minimum of 10 hours a week.

2015-05-31,Voting system 'archaic and divisive',https://web.archive.org//web/20150601103602/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32954807,"The 2015 general election was the ""most disproportionate in British history"", the Electoral Reform Society has said.In a new analysis the society - which campaigns to change the voting system - has assessed how the make up of Parliament would have differed had other voting systems been used.The research shows UKIP could have won as many as 80 MPs and the Greens 20.UKIP received 3.9 million votes and the Greens 1.2 million, and they ended up with one MP each.Katie Ghose, chief executive of the society, described the current system, usually known as first-past-the-post, as ""archaic"" and ""divisive"".She said: it ""leaves millions disenfranchised and forces millions more to feel that they have to vote for a 'lesser evil.'"" ""It's about time we had a fairer system for electing our MPs.""How different voting systems workFirst-past-the-post (used in UK general elections): People get a single vote for who they want to represent their constituency and whichever candidate gets the most votes wins.Single transferable vote (used in Northern Ireland Assembly elections and Scottish council elections): Voters number candidates in order of preference and all those passing a defined threshold - calculated by dividing the number of valid votes by the number of seats plus one - are elected. Their surplus votes are distributed to other candidates on the basis of other preferences with low-scoring candidates being progressively eliminated. The system sees more than one candidate elected from a single constituency. Additional member system (used in Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly elections): Some representatives are elected via the traditional first-past-the post method but voters get to cast a second vote for ""top-up"" seats, allocated in proportion to the number of votes. These representatives are selected on a regional basis from lists of candidates drawn up by each party.Party list system (used in European Parliament elections): The UK is divided into large constituencies, known as regions, and different parties put together lists of candidates for election, with their preferred choices at the top. Seats are allocated, on a top-down basis, in proportion to parties' share of the vote.Supplementary vote (used in London mayoral elections): Voters choose their first and second preferences and a candidate can only be elected in the first round if they get 50% of the vote. If no-one achieves this, all but the top two candidates are eliminated and their second preferences redistributed to the candidates still in the race. The candidate with the most votes is then elected.Alternative Vote (rejected in 2011 UK-wide referendum): Voters rank candidates in order of preference and anyone getting more than 50% in the first round is elected. If that doesn't happen, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated and their second choices allocated to the remaining candidates. This process continues until a winner emerges.Alternative Vote Plus: As well as voters ranking constituency candidates in order of preference, they would get a second vote at a regional level either for a party or for their favourite candidate from a list proposed by the parties. This would mean having a group of constituency MPs and a group of ""party list"" MPs.In a survey commissioned by the society and carried out by pollsters YouGov, over 40,000 people were asked how they would have voted in the general election had they been required to rank the parties in order of preference.The report, entitled The 2015 General Election: A Voting System in Crisis, found that under a list-based system of proportional representation similar to the kind used in European elections, the outcome would have been very different. In this case Conservatives would have won 242 seats (-89), Labour 208 (-24), the SNP 30 (-26), the Lib Dems 47 (+39), Plaid Cymru 5 (+2), UKIP 80 (+79) and the Greens 20 (+19).First past the post v List PRHowever, the analysis also found that under analternative vote system, where voters' preferences are reallocated until one candidate gets over 50%, the election result would be similar to that of 7 May, with the Conservatives winning 337 seats - an increase of six.In this case Labour would have 227 (-5), the SNP 54 (-2), the Lib Dems 9 (+1), Plaid Cymru 3 (no change), UKIP 1 (no change) and the Greens 1 (no change). First past the post v Alternative VoteAnd the research showed that under a single transferable vote (STV) system, similar to the kind currently used in Scottish local elections, the Conservatives would have won 276 seats (-55), Labour 236 (+4), the SNP 34 (-22), the Lib Dems 26 (+18), Plaid Cymru 3 (nc), UKIP 54 (+53) and the Greens 3 (+2).First past the post v STV""Our voting system is breaking up Britain,"" Ms Ghose added.""First Past the Post is artificially dividing the UK, giving the SNP nearly all Scottish seats on half the vote, while excluding Labour from the south of England and over-representing them in Wales.""Since the election, politicians from UKIP, the Greens, Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru and the SNP have supported a petition calling for voting reform. The Electoral Reform Society used the D'Hondt method for converting votes to seats in a list-based PR system. Ms Ghose later told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Voters have changed fundamentally. They're shopping around, they're supporting a wider range of parties than ever before and I think that the system's really struggling to cope with that.""But Labour MP Dame Margaret Beckett said the current system tended to give the electorate what they wanted.""One of the virtues of our present system is that the British people understand it, they know how to work it. In 2010 they didn't like any of us and they didn't give any of us a majority,"" she said. ""But in 2015 they said 'hang on a minute, we'd rather have a majority government of one or the other, than a mess'."""
2015-05-31,Cooper in 'Tory manifesto' warning,https://web.archive.org//web/20150601103602/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32950412,"Labour leadership contender Yvette Cooper has accused some in the party of ""swallowing the Tory manifesto"" following its election defeat.Asked if she was referring to rival Liz Kendall, the shadow home secretary said she did not want to attack individuals.She also warned against ""stigmatizing"" those on benefits after a third leadership candidate, Andy Burnham, said the party appeared ""soft"" on them.Mr Burnham has meanwhile warned that the party faces becoming ""irrelevant"".The shadow health secretary told BBC Radio 5 live's Pienaar's Politics the party cannot assume the general election was its lowest point, saying it could becoming increasingly irrelevant if it doesn't respond to people's concerns. ""Labour has lost its emotional connection with many people,"" he said. ""People look at us and they don't see people they can relate to.""Mr Burnham claimed the party had been run by a ""metropolitan elite"" for ""too long"". He also warned against pursuing the ""politics of envy"", citing the way the party had presented the mansion tax during the election campaign as being problematic, but he backed the 50p top tax rate policy.He and Ms Kendall are seen as the current frontrunners in the race to succeed Ed Miliband as Labour leader. Shadow International Development Secretary Mary Creagh has also thrown her hat into the ring.Candidates must get the support of 35 of the party's MPs in order to stand in the contest, which will be decided in September.Ms Kendall, who is seen as the right wing, Blairite contender in the leadership race, has spoken of the need to appeal to Conservative voters in the south of England to win back power.Ms Cooper warned against a move to the right, telling BBC One's Andrew Marr Show: ""I will set out ideas for the future that don't just involve swallowing the Tory manifesto and set out a Labour vision for the future.""I think some of our colleagues, in some of the discussions, have been thinking 'OK, because we lost the election therefore what we have to do is go to the right.'""The shadow home secretary also appeared to take aim at Mr Burnham, who said last week that Labour had appeared to be ""soft"" on people ""who want something for nothing"".""What I won't do is fall in to what I think is a Tory trap of using language which stigmatises those who are not working. I don't think that is about Labour values,"" Ms Cooper told the programme.  ""I think the important thing is to talk about responsibility - responsibility to work, responsibility to contribute - but not to stigmatise those who are unable to work, perhaps because they are too sick or too disabled to do so.""Ms Cooper said that while in principle she supported Conservative proposals to cut the benefit cap to £23,000 a year, she said there were problems in practice, particularly in London where rents were high.She also said that she still supported Labour plans to restore the 50p top rate of tax after it was cut by the coalition in the last parliament to 45p - something also backed by Mr Burnham.Acting Labour leader Harriet Harman has said the party needs to go through a process like a ""truth and reconciliation"" commission to learn lessons from its election defeat.She said it would be wrong to try to maintain a ""veneer of tranquillity and unity"" during the leadership contest and that people should instead be encouraged to ""speak their minds"" and listen to some ""uncomfortable truths"". Ed Miliband's leadership should also come under the microscope because ""we lost badly and in a way we didn't expect,"" she told Sky News' Murnaghan,"
2015-05-31,Employers of carers 'to pay pension',https://web.archive.org//web/20150601103602/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-32935827,"Up to 100,000 people who employ personal carers are being warned that they may now be legally liable to pay them pension contributions.From 1 June, small businesses employing up to 30 staff will gradually be obliged to offer their staff pensions, under the auto-enrolment programme.That includes people who only employ one person, such as a carer or a nanny.The Pensions Regulator, which oversees the programme, says those who do not comply could receive a fine of £400.However, it says it is working with 200 support organisations to make sure people get proper advice.Under auto enrolment, all employees over the age of 22 who earn more than £10,000 a year will now have the right to a workplace pension - unless they decide to opt out.So far, 5.2 million workers in 45,000 larger companies have joined the scheme. Between now and 2018, an estimated 3.8 million more workers will be enrolled by about 1.3 million employers.  Anyone who took on an employee for the first time after 1 April 2012 will not have to pay pension contributions for another two years.And many elderly or disabled people - whose carer is organised through the local authority - may find the pension contributions being paid for them.But it is far from clear whether all local authorities will be prepared to take on the extra costs of a pension.All the Department for Work and Pensions will say is that councils ""should consider"" the costs.In the meantime, warning letters sent out by the Pensions Regulator have come as a surprise to many people who employ carers.""It's come out of the blue, and they've just been unaware of it,"" said Edward Graham, head of advice and information at the charity, Carers UK.""It's caused a very high degree of anxiety amongst many people who've received these letters.""Those who employ a carer on a salary of £15,000 a year will have to make pension contributions of £185 a year within two years of the scheme starting.The first £5,824 of income is ignored, as is any income over £42,385.Pension costs for nannies - who can earn much more than carers - might be considerably higher.Louise Taylor, a director at agency Kensington Nannies, puts the cost at between £300 and £500 a year, but believes few people will be put off.""In the grand scheme of things, another £400 is not going to stop you from hiring a nanny,"" she told the BBC.However, she said that many people finding nannies on the internet will be unaware that they are liable for pension contributions.Equally, many nannies will be unaware of their rights.""A nanny new to Britain will not know she has a right to a pension,"" she said.People who employ cleaners or gardeners will not be affected, unless they pay them more than £10,000 a year."
2015-05-31,Petraeus: 'Politics can defeat IS',https://web.archive.org//web/20150601103602/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-32950900,"Ex-CIA Director David Petraeus has told the BBC that Islamic State militants can only be defeated through a dual military and political approach.""Industrial-strength"" extremists cannot be dealt with ""just with force of arms"", he said in a rare interview.During the Iraq war, Mr Petraeus devised the strategy that saw a ""surge"" in US troop numbers and secured support from Sunni tribesmen against al-Qaeda.Iraq's US-backed army is now battling to retake territory seized by IS.Gen Petraeus described the group as ""a formidable enemy"". ""It is really a conventional army that also has elements of an insurgency, and indeed significant terrorist elements as well,"" he said.But when asked to compare IS with its predecessor, al-Qaeda in Iraq - which Gen Petraeus was instrumental in defeating - he said the latter ""had much greater roots in Iraq and much greater numbers than IS"".The retired general characterised the recent capture by IS of Ramadi, the capital of Anbar province, as ""a strategic loss in the sense that the narrative of IS being on the defensive - of losing - was shown to be somewhat hollow"".""I do think Ramadi will be retaken in a matter of weeks or less,"" he added. ""But this was a big setback. At such a time, one has to look at the strategy, at refinements that need to be made, at efforts that need to be augmented, and I know that's what's going on right now.""1974: Graduates from West Point US military academy, joining the army2007: Leads US troop surge during Iraq conflict2008: Head of US Central Command2010: Nato commander in AfghanistanMid-2011: Leaves military to become CIA directorNovember 2012: Resigns over affairAfter commanding international troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, Gen Petraeus became head of the CIA but was forced to stand down in 2012, following revelations of an extra-marital affair.Subsequent allegations that he provided classified information to his mistress while he was CIA director led him to plead guilty to one misdemeanour charge. But despite the turbulence of his private life, Gen Petraeus remains one of the heroes of America's controversial military operations of recent years. He was the architect of the ""surge"" in Iraq that deployed more US troops, but equally important, got them out of their defended compounds to create security at a local level.He also greatly expanded the Anbar Awakening, the mobilisation of Sunni tribesmen to combat al-Qaeda. Not surprisingly in the wake of the recent setbacks in Iraq, his views are being canvassed by the White House, the Pentagon, and on Capitol Hill.The keynote of the Petraeus approach today is as it always was - the need for the political and military aspects of strategy to march closely in step.""You cannot deal with an industrial-strength extremist problem just with force of arms,"" he said.  ""You have to have that political component as well.""Political change has to start at the top. Above all, Gen Petraeus says, ""the Sunni Arabs have to be given incentives to support the new Iraq rather than to oppose it"".As to the fundamental question - can the Iraqi military actually win against Islamic State? - he has few doubts.""During the surge and in the years after the surge, Iraqi forces fought and died for their country at vastly higher numbers than did US and coalition forces. We know that they can fight,"" he insists.""We know that they will fight. But they will only fight if they have good leadership, and the support and knowledge that somebody will have their back if they get into a tough fight.""That looks like requiring greater US involvement closer to the frontline. Gen Petraeus is reluctant to give details.""Should there be US advisors with Iraqi forces below the divisional  level?"" he asks. ""Should there be joint teams of tactical air controllers on the ground with security and other assets to support them?""Does there need to be an augmentation of the train-and-equip effort? Can we accelerate the delivery of some of the equipment that Iraq so desperately needs?""It sounds like the elements of a blueprint for a re-invigorated US effort. But then again - typical Petraeus - there is the political dimension.""Are we doing all that we can to empower and support those Iraqi leaders, starting with Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, who recognise the need to bring the Sunni Arab population back into the fabric of Iraqi society? And, most importantly, are our military elements and structures sufficiently supporting the political component and vice versa?""In response to my comment that all this could have been said a year ago - Gen Petraeus responded by saying that he did indeed say it all a year ago. This is not about re-inventing the wheel.""We need to see the same elements of this (previous) comprehensive civil-military counter- insurgency campaign, albeit today with the Iraqis playing the key roles, enabled by the Americans."" Gen Petraeus acknowledges the difficulties of grappling with the horrors in Syria but insists that the only way forward is to train and equip moderate opposition elements. He says that more such fighters will spring up once the programme gets under way. And he is very cautious about any Iranian role in combating IS. He insists Iran remains a revolutionary power in the region. ""This is a country that has made progress because of chaos. It has both benefited from chaos and fomented chaos to try to achieve regional hegemony,"" he says.So he believes that ""while there can indeed be some coincidence of interest between the US, its coalition allies in the region and Iran in terms of the defeat of IS (...) the over-arching context is one that gives you reason to have considerable caution in how you go forward in the relationship with Iran"".Gen Petraeus still travels to Iraq regularly. He knows the key players well. And though out of uniform and established in a civilian career as an adviser, he remains the man who did achieve a kind of success in Iraq.That is a commodity that is in short supply today for the Americans and the Iraqi authorities. This  makes the Petraeus approach an attractive model.But the question remains: Can the outcome be the same with the Iraqi military cast in the role of the Americans?"
2015-05-31,Purvis sets out constitution plan,https://web.archive.org//web/20150601103602/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32953249,"Scottish Liberal Democrat peer Jeremy Purvis has set out plans for a new constitutional convention for the UK.Lord Purvis said he wanted an end to the current ""make do and mend"" approach to constitutional reform that could ""threaten the UK"". His proposal contains plans for further devolution to each of the home nations and local authorities.It also suggests ways of reforming the Westminster voting system and the House of Lords.The peer presented his Constitutional Convention Bill in the House of Lords on Monday. He said it aimed to deliver a ""sustainable, balanced devolution settlement that works for the whole UK.""His proposals would see a year-long convention comprised of politicians from all political parties and representatives from wider civic society.Scotland is due to receive new powers over tax next year when the Scotland Bill comes into effect.However, following its landslide victory in the general election, the SNP has been pressing the UK government for further powers over employment and welfare policy.The SNP's general election manifesto said it was in favour of so-called full fiscal autonomy - power over all tax and spending - but that this would take time to deliver.Meanwhile, Tory MP Ian Stewart told the BBC on Sunday that his party was open to constitutional reform for the rest of the UK.Plans to give MPs from English constituencies an effective veto on laws affecting only England were included in last week's Queen's Speech.Lord Purvis welcomed the new powers package for Scotland but said ""piecemeal devolution"" could not deliver stability.He added: ""Pitting one part of the UK against another is no way to secure the future of our country.""We need to abolish the make do and mend approach to reform that has let the SNP move the devolution goalposts time and again in a way that might work for them, but not for Scotland or the rest of the UK.""A constitutional convention will help us reach a settlement that protects the future of the UK and delivers communities the powers they need to thrive.""Lord Purvis also said it was time to ""grasp the nettle"" and tackle reform of the electoral system and the House of Lords.

2015-05-31,NHS to target 'rip-off' temp agencies,https://web.archive.org//web/20150601103602/http://www.bbc.com/news/health-32950969,"The health service plans to ""clamp down on some of the staffing agencies ripping off the NHS"", the chief executive of NHS England has said.Simon Stevens admitted that NHS hospitals were ""over-spending"" on temporary staffing.But he told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show that the NHS would be taking action against staffing agencies.Mr Stevens also said hospitals needed to ensure they offered ""flexible employment"" to nursing staff.He said: ""What we've got to do is convert that [agency] spending into good, paying permanent jobs.""Mr Stevens drew attention to a recent regulator's report, which showed that NHS foundation trusts in England spent £1.8bn in 2014 on agency and contract staff - twice the planned amount. He said the rise was partly due to hospitals putting more nurses on wards, following the public inquiry into the Stafford Hospital scandal.Though he admitted it was ""very hard"" for individual hospitals to take action against agencies, he said ""collectively the NHS can take action here and we will be doing that"". Commenting on Prime Minister David Cameron's vow to create a ""seven-day"" health service, Mr Stevens said it would incur extra costs but could also provide savings.The government has committed to a pre-election pledge to boost NHS funding by at least £8bn a year by 2020.Asked whether that would cover the extra needed for the new service, he said: ""There will be costs associated with it but there will also be efficiencies. ""And the reason for that is that if you're admitted to hospital on a weekend your length of stay in hospital [currently] turns out to be rather longer because some of the other services you need aren't in place.""In a wide ranging interview on the Andrew Marr Show, Mr Stevens described obesity as the ""new smoking"", urging parents, schools and the food industry to do more to tackle it.He pointed to a string of Saturday newspaper reports warning that obesity will soon overtake smoking as the leading cause of cancer.Mr Stevens said one in five cancer deaths was now caused by obesity, adding that the food industry had a ""huge responsibility here"".He said: ""I do think we are going to need reformulation to take sugar out of foods in the same way that has successfully happened with salt over the last several years. I think responsible retailers, food producers, can smell the coffee here.""They can see that public attitudes are changing and they are going to need to take action because we can see that if that doesn't happen, then in effect what we are doing is a slow burn of food poisoning through all of this sugar that then goes on to cause cancer, diabetes, heart disease. ""That's what we are doing to our kids, we've got to stop it."""
2015-05-31,Defence cuts 'risk UK disengagement',https://web.archive.org//web/20150601103602/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32955231,"The US defence secretary says he fears the UK could become ""disengaged"" if it makes further cuts to defence spending.Ashton Carter told the BBC Britain had ""always punched above its weight"" and ""it would be a great loss to the world if it now took action that would indicate disengagement"".The UK government said it was committed to meeting Nato's target of spending 2% of GDP on defence this financial year.But it says future budgets will be determined in the next spending review.Few countries have met the Nato target and at a summit in Wales last September, the commitment was watered down, with the less ambitious goal that those countries that were not meeting the target would ""halt any decline in defence expenditure"".Those countries already spending 2% were encouraged to stick to that commitment and David Cameron made a speech urging other European members of the military alliance to boost spending.Mr Carter said: ""Britain has always had an independent ability to express itself and basically punch above its weight.""I'd hate to see that go away because I think it's a great loss to the world when a country of that much history and standing… takes actions which seem to indicate disengagement. ""We need an engaged United Kingdom.""Mr Carter's comments follow similar remarks earlier this year by the head of the US Army, General Raymond Odierno, who warned further cuts could see British units operating within US ranks, rather than divisions working alongside each other.MPs and UK military commanders - former and serving - have also said Britain's security ability would be threatened by more cuts.Julian Lewis, Conservative MP for New Forest East, told BBC Radio 4's The World at One that 2% spending on defence ""is not a target, it's a minimum"" and any possibility that level may drop was ""frankly staggering"".""The international situation is darkening and what we must avoid at all costs is having to spend the money later when a crisis has arisen, when by spending it now we might help deter people from provoking such crisis,"" he said.The cross-party Defence Select Committee also argued recently that the rise of Islamic State and the increase in Russian aggression meant Britain's 2010 defence plans ""no longer reflect the new threats to peace around the world"". Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said the UK was committed to meeting the 2% target in the current financial year and insisted he was ""confident"" the government would continue to provide the armed forces with the resources they need.He said: ""We will always go on looking for ways to make defence more efficient, to ensure that more of the money is spent on the front line, just as we've done over each of the last five years.""It's quite proper for the chancellor to ask departments to be more efficient. We will do that.""The British Army is already undergoing a 20% reduction in regular troop numbers, from 102,000 in 2010 to 82,000 in 2020.This is to be accompanied by a rise in the number of reservists, from 24,000 to 30,000.The Royal Navy and the RAF are both preparing to lose 5,000 regulars and gain 500 reservists over the same period."

Asked about the issue on Sky News, Mr Redwood said:  ""Of course they should be free to campaign as they see fit and they will be free to campaign as they see fit. ""The only issue is whether they are asked to leave their government positions before they do it or not.""The Conservative MP claimed there would be no risk to jobs and trade if Britain left the EU because the trading bloc needed to remain on good terms with the UK. He told Sky News he wants Britain to come out of the ""current EU"" but would support Mr Cameron if he gets a ""really good deal"" in renegotiation.Ken Clarke, a longstanding advocate of Britain's membership of the EU, also urged Mr Cameron to allow ministers to campaign for the ""no"" side if they wanted to.He told BBC One's Sunday Politics the referendum was meant to allow people to solve their differences on Europe in a ""civilised way,"" adding: ""I would let the Eurosceptics have a kind of free exercise in campaigning in the referendum.""He dismissed demands by Conservative Eurosceptics like former defence secretary Liam Fox for Mr Cameron to seek the repatriation of powers from Brussels as part of his re-negotiation.""He (Cameron) is not asking to repatriate any powers,"" he said. ""Most of the people demanding the repatriation of powers can't think of any or want to repatriate powers that would lead, for example, to an inability to tackle international crime.""He said he was in favour of an early referendum, amid speculation one could be held next year.""If we let if drift on this daft debate will continue and it really does actually cause a great deal of uncertainty,"" said the Tory MP.There has also been some debate who should lead the official Yes and No campaigns.Mr Clarke ruled himself out and said it should be someone younger who could command cross-party support but he was hoping to play a role in the referendum through a pro-EU pressure group called British Influence.Labour's Frank Field, who is in favour of Britain's exit, said it should be someone who is young enough not to have taken part in the 1975 EU referendum, when Britain voted to stay in.But UKIP MP Douglas Carswell suggested a business leader such as Sir James Dyson, 68, who was a ""wealth creator,"" should head up the campaign to come out.He stressed that the ""really important thing"" was that the case for leaving the EU was ""made in a really positive way"".In a separate development,  former president of the European Commission Jose Manuel Barroso said it would be difficult for David Cameron to get ""important change"" without reopening EU treaties, something that is resisted by France, Poland and other countries."

His party's ard chomhairle (national executive) met in Dublin on Saturday to discuss the political and financial crisis facing Stormont's institutions.Mr Maskey said they agreed that Sinn Féin ""cannot and will not stand over"" proposed cuts to the welfare system.He called for further talks with the UK government, saying a deal was ""doable"".Speaking on the BBC's Sunday Politics programme, Mr Maskey said: ""The ard chomhairle had a very long conversation yesterday.""We understand fully the implications of where this might go, we do not want the collapse of the institutions. ""What we do want is to recreate the agreement that the five parties had at Christmas.  Let's sit down and hammer that out again if need be, it is doable.""In March, Sinn Féin dramatically withdrew its support for the wide-ranging deal it had struck last December, known as the Stormont House Agreement.The agreement provided mitigation measures that would have protected benefit recipients in Northern Ireland who stood to lose out as a result of welfare reform.The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) minister who tried unsuccessfully to pass the Welfare Reform Bill in the assembly last week told the Sunday Politics that those protective measures have been ""lost"" and ""put in the bin"" because of the parties' failure to agree.Social Development Minister Mervyn Storey accused Sinn Féin of being led by its ""southern command"" in the Republic of Ireland over welfare policy.Mr Storey said Sinn Féin was ""looking both ways"" and ""constantly looking over its shoulder in relation to what happens in another jurisdiction"".However, Mr Maskey said: ""Sinn Féin doesn't have a northern command or a southern command, it has a national party leadership.""The West Belfast MLA listed examples of deals, once believed to impossible, that were struck during the peace process, including the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, the 2006 St Andrews Agreement that led to the DUP sharing power with Sinn Féin and the devolution of policing and justice in 2010.Northern Ireland Secretary of State Theresa Villiers has written to party leaders inviting them to a review of the Stormont House Agreement on Tuesday."

2015-05-31,Economic growth 'up several gears',https://web.archive.org//web/20150601103602/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32949991,"The speed at which the British economy is growing is increasing, the Confederation of British Industry says.Research by the CBI suggests business activity increased markedly in the three months to May.Rain Newton-Smith, the CBI's director of economics, said growth had ""cranked up several gears"".In April official figures revealed the UK economy grew by 0.3% in the first three months of 2015, which marked the slowest quarterly growth for two years.BBC business correspondent Joe Lynam said those April figures stoked fears that the country might be set for a slowdown.But now the CBI is suggesting that all sectors of the economy are growing.Its latest survey of more than 800 companies suggests the services sector - which ranges from restaurants and plumbing to banking and finance - stood out in particular.This sector recorded its fastest growth in business volumes since February 2006 and was the main driver of the overall acceleration, the survey concluded.The CBI said growth could be boosted further as things improve economically in the Eurozone, which is the UK's largest trading partner.Ms Newton-Smith added: ""As we move through the second quarter, growth has cranked up several gears and businesses expect that faster pace to continue.""This supports our belief that the weaker-than-expected GDP growth in the early months of 2015 will be short-lived.""A stellar increase in activity in the business and professional service sector and retail sales bounding ahead are clear indications of strong business and consumer confidence and increased spending power.""UK exports are likely to be helped by renewed momentum in the euro area but the stronger pound and weak demand in many overseas markets continue to pose challenges.""Earlier in the month the CBI urged businesses to ""speak out early"" in favour of remaining in a reformed European Union.Its president Sir Mike Rake said there were ""no credible alternatives"" to EU membership."
2015-05-31,Bill-by-bill: Queen's Speech,https://web.archive.org//web/20150601103602/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32898443,"The government's legislative plans for the year ahead have been unveiled in the Queen's Speech to Parliament. Here is a guide to the bills that were announced.This will pave the way for an in/out referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union. David Cameron has promised to renegotiate Britain's relationship with the 28-member bloc and put it to a public vote by 2017 at the latest. There is speculation it could be held as early as autumn 2016.This bill, as the name would suggest, is designed to achieve full employment ""and provide more people with the security of a job"". The aim is for two million more jobs and three million new apprenticeships to be created. Ministers will be required to report annually to Parliament on their progress. The legislation will also implement a planned reduction in the welfare cap - from £26,000 to £23,000, and freeze working-age benefits, tax credit and child benefit for two years. As part of the government's welfare reforms, young people will be required to ""earn or learn"", with automatic entitlement to housing benefit for 18-21-year-olds scrapped.Read more details on gov.ukThis bill will include measures to reduce regulation on small businesses in a bid to boost job creation. It will seek to cut red tape for British business by at least £10bn and, for the first time, require independent regulators to contribute to that target. In addition, it proposes to create a new Small Business Conciliation Service, to help settle disputes between small and large businesses, especially over late payment practices. The government also aims to improve the business rates system ahead of the 2017 revaluation, including by modernising the appeals system. And it proposes to introduce a cap on public sector redundancy payments. to six figures for the highest earners.This wide-ranging bill is designed to enact a series of tax pledges made by the Conservatives during the general election campaign. Specifically that there would be no rise in income tax rates, VAT or national insurance before 2020 and that ""no one working 30 hours on the minimum wage pays any income tax at all"". It will also enact a commitment to raise the threshold before which people pay income tax to £12,500 - a move ministers say will benefit 30 million people. The government says the purpose of the bill is to ""reward those who work hard and do the right thing"".A Childcare Bill will include measures to help working people ""by greatly increasing the provision of free childcare"". Under the proposals, parents in England would be entitled to 30 hours a week of free childcare for their three- and four-year-olds, for 38 weeks of the year. Currently, they are entitled to 570 hours of free early education or childcare a year, which works out as 15 hours each week over the 38-week period.Plans to support home ownership and extend the right-to-buy scheme to 1.3 million social housing tenants in England feature in a new Housing Bill. Under the plans, housing association tenants will be able to buy the homes they rent at a discount. There will also be help for first-time buyers, with 200,000 starter homes made available to under-40s at a 20% discount. Both are commitments which were included in the Conservatives' general election manifesto. The government says the bill will increase the housing supply and ensure local people have more control over planning.Measures will be introduced to ""increase energy security"" and ensure there will be ""affordable and reliable energy for businesses and families"". The government proposes to establish the Oil and Gas Authority as an independent regulator, charged with regulation of domestic oil and gas recovery. It would transfer responsibility for giving consent for any large onshore wind farms in England and Wales from Whitehall to local planning authorities.Read more details on gov.ukThe government is promising to ""control immigration"" and put ""hard-working British families first"". Its Immigration Bill is designed to support working people, clamp down on illegal immigration and protect public services. Specifically, it will include a new offence of illegal working - with police given the power to seize the wages paid to illegal workers as the ""proceeds of crime"". There are also proposals to deal with unscrupulous landlords and to evict illegal migrants more quickly, while all foreign criminals awaiting deportation will be fitted with satellite tracking tags. It will also become an offence for businesses and recruitment agencies to hire abroad without first advertising in the UK - a policy which featured prominently in Labour's election manifesto - and a new enforcement agency will be set up to tackle what the prime minister called ""the worst cases of exploitation""Read more details on gov.ukThis paves the way for powers over housing, transport, planning and policing to be devolved to England's cities as part of government plans for ""a balanced economic recovery"". Cities that want them will be able to have elected mayors. Chancellor George Osborne has said previously that Greater Manchester - which will take on the powers when electing a mayor in two years - should become a blueprint for other large cities.The government is pressing ahead with legislation that will eventually enable work to start on the £50bn HS2 high-speed rail link. Legislation which will give the government the legal powers to construct and operate the London to Birmingham first phase of HS2 is going through Parliament. If it progresses smoothly, it should receive Royal Assent around the end of 2016, with work beginning on the project in 2017, with a finishing date of 2026.Read more details on gov.ukThe government will press ahead with further Scottish devolution as part of plans to deliver ""a strong and lasting constitutional settlement"". The Scottish Parliament will be given new tax and welfare powers, under the proposals. It follows the recommendations of the Smith Commission on Scottish devolution.There will also be further devolution of powers to Wales, under the government's plans, including a new reserved powers model to clarify the division of powers between the Welsh Assembly and Parliament. The assembly will also be given more powers over energy, transport and local government elections in Wales.Continuing the devolution theme, there will be a bill to give effect to the Stormont House Agreement in Northern Ireland. It will provide for full and independent investigations into ""unsolved Troubles-related deaths"", the government says.Read more details on gov.ukLegislation to introduce a blanket ban on so-called legal highs featured in the Queen's Speech. The government says the move is to ""protect UK citizens from the risks posed by untested, unknown and potentially harmful drugs"". It would be an offence to produce, supply, offer to supply, possess, import or export psychoactive substances. The proposal was included in the Conservatives' general election manifesto.Read more details on gov.ukThis includes measures to tackle broadcasting of extremist material. The government wants to strengthen watchdog Ofcom so that it can take action against channels that transmit extremist content. The legislation will also propose the introduction of banning orders for extremist organisations who use hate speech in public places, but whose activities fall short of proscription. A new power to allow police and local authorities to close down premises used to support extremism will also feature. And employers will be able to check whether an individual is an extremist and barring them from working with children.""New legislation will modernise the law on communications data,"" the speech said. An Investigatory Powers Bill will revive plans to give intelligence agencies new tools to target communications data - branded a ""snooper's charter"" by critics. The government says it will equip the police intelligence agencies with the tools to keep people safe.The government is promising to ""improve the law"" in this area to make communities ""safer"" and to ""build confidence and improve efficiency"" in the criminal justice system. It includes plans to reform pre-charge bail in England and Wales - with an initial 28-day limit, and to ban the use of police cells for the emergency detention of mentally ill people under the Mental Health Act. There are also proposals to reform the Police Federation in England and Wales, and plans to extend police-led prosecutions and overhaul the complaints system. Measures to beef up child protection also feature.Read more details on gov.ukThe main elements of the Bill are a 50% voting threshold for union strike ballot turnouts, and a requirement that 40% of those entitled to vote must back action in essential public services - health, education, fire and transport. Time limits will also be introduced on a mandate following a ballot for industrial action. The government says the aim is to ensure that strikes are the result of ""clear, positive and recent decisions"" by union members as well as ensuring that disruption to essential public services has a democratic mandate. There will also be the introduction of ""a transparent opt-in process for the political fund element of trade union subscriptions"", along the lines of the Northern Ireland system. Read more details on gov.ukThis bill is designed to raise standards in schools. Under the plans, new powers would be brought forward to speed up the process of changing a failing school's leadership and turning it into an academy. Those considered to be ""coasting"" - not performing as well as they could be - would also face being taken over. The bill will also give the education secretary new powers to force local councils to hand over their responsibilities for adoption to another authority or agency.This bill is designed to continue in force the legislation governing the Armed Forces. It would also make provision for other defence matters. Read more details on gov.ukThis piece of legislation is designed to ""further strengthen"" the governance and accountability of the Bank of England, according to the government. It will include measures working towards aligning monetary policy, macro prudential policy and micro prudential regulation. Read more details on gov.ukMeasures to protect charities from abuse and to strengthen the powers of the Charity Commission for England and Wales feature in this bill. It is also designed to enable charities to more easily undertake social investments. Read more details on gov.ukThe speech set out plans for legislation to scrap the current 15-year time limit on UK citizens living abroad voting in Westminster and European elections. The government says it would make it easier for overseas electors to cast their votes in time to be counted, and encourage larger numbers of British citizens living abroad to register to vote in UK elections. Read more details on gov.ukThe purpose of this bill is to give UK approval to the financing aspect of the seven year EU Budget deal agreed in 2013, which saw a real-terms cut in EU spending. It would preserve the UK's rebate, and prevent new EU-wide taxes to finance EU spending, the government says. Read more details on gov.ukThis bill would provide the option for combined authority areas with directly-elected mayors to be responsible for the running of their local bus services. The government says the move would allow cities to promote an integrated transport system. Read more details on gov.ukThis is the one draft bill to feature in the Queen's Speech. It proposed to reform and modernise the Public Service Ombudsman sector to provide ""a more effective and accessible final tier of complaints redress within the public sector"". It would absorb the functions of the Parliamentary Ombudsman, the Health Ombudsman, and the Local Government Ombudsman and potentially the Housing Ombudsman.Although it appears in the Queen's Speech, there is no legislation, either in full or draft form, on a British Bill of Rights. Instead, ministers will consult on the pros of replacing the Human Rights Act with a new legal framework of rights and responsibilities. There is no mention of any plan to repeal the ban on hunting of wild mammals with hounds, in force since 2005. Ministers have suggested MPs will be given an opportunity to decide on the matter by 2020, and will be given a free vote. "

That means the maximum size of any field is six contenders.Under rules agreed last year, all Labour Party members, registered supporters and affiliated supporters - including union members - will be allowed a maximum of one vote each on a one member, one vote system. When the election is held, they will be asked to rank candidates in order of preference.If no candidate gets 50% of all votes cast, the votes will be added up and the candidate with the fewest votes eliminated.

That is the question many people will be asking after the party which has fought for Scottish independence for 80 years swept to victory.

David Cameron's victory also represents a colossal achievement.""James Landale, deputy political editor: ""After an extraordinary night, some brief conclusions: With a small majority or slight minority for David Cameron, Tory MPs will be much empowered. As such, Mr Cameron will need support from other parties to get business through. The PM will also need a better whips office to handle rebellions.""Laura Kuenssberg, chief correspondent, Newsnight: ""For Labour the story of their terrible night is rapidly turning into the search for a new leader. So who will that be? Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, is almost certain to run.

2015-05-31,"EU referendum: What, when and why?",https://web.archive.org//web/20150601103602/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"The UK is set to have a referendum by the end of 2017 on whether or not to remain a member of the European Union.The Conservatives' election manifesto promised to hold a referendum (a nationwide vote) on whether or not the UK should stay in or leave the European Union. They won the election so it's all systems go.A referendum is basically a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part, normally giving a ""Yes"" or ""No"" answer to a question. Whichever side gets more than half of all votes cast is considered to have won.The European Union is an economic and political partnership between 28 European countries. It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, its own parliament and it now sets the rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things like mobile phone charges.The one thing we know for sure is that Prime Minister David Cameron has said it will happen by the end of 2017. The most likely times of the year for referendums are generally May or September, and some people think it should be held as soon as possible - possibly even in May 2016, to coincide with elections in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and London, rather than waiting for 2017. When David Cameron announced in January 2013 his pledge to hold a referendum, a key element was that he would seek to make changes to the way the European Union works - or at least the rules covering the UK as a European Union member. Only once this renegotiation of British membership had been completed would he put the new arrangement to the public vote.During the election the Lib Dems and Labour both said they did not want a referendum unless there were plans to transfer more powers from the UK to the EU. Labour has since dropped its opposition, so the Conservatives are expected to get their Referendum Bill passed easily. The House of Lords could delay it, but as the referendum was promised in the Conservative election manifesto (a manifesto is a document setting out what a party would do if they won the election) it is not likely to reject the bill once MPs back it.The question is always crucial in any referendum and there is already debate about what it should be. The 2013 suggestion from the Conservatives was: ""Do you think that the United Kingdom should remain a member of the European Union?"" Some people thought this phrasing leaned too far towards the status quo - the current state of affairs - and the Electoral Commission, which has to approve the question, said it was not clear enough and proposed:""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union?""Read more: Does the wording of a referendum question matter?British, Irish and Commonwealth citizens over 18 who are resident in the UK, along with UK nationals who have lived overseas for less than 15 years. Members of the House of Lords and Commonwealth citizens in Gibraltar will also be eligible, unlike in a general election. Citizens from EU countries - apart from Ireland, Malta and Cyprus - will not get a vote.Mr Cameron is not revealing the full details of what he wants from the other EU leaders ahead of negotiations - but he is expected to demand an opt-out from one of its core principles of forging an ""ever-closer union"" between member states. He will also try to get restrictions on welfare benefits - in particular, tax credits - for migrants and more powers to block or opt out of new EU laws.Read more: Q&A: What Britain wants from EuropeBritain had a referendum in 1975 shortly after it had joined the EU, or the Common Market as it was then called. The country voted to stay in then but there have been growing calls, from the public and politicians, for another vote because, they argue, the EU has changed a lot over the past 40 years, with many more countries joining and the organisation extending its control over more aspects of daily lives. David Cameron initially resisted these calls but in 2013 he changed his mind.About 33% of the British public, according to the latest opinion polls. The UK Independence Party, which won the last European elections, and received nearly four million votes, 13% of those cast, in May's general election, campaigns for Britain's exit from the EU. A fair number of Conservative MPs - and several Labour ones - are also thought to be strongly in favour of leaving.They believe Britain is being held back by the EU, which they say imposes too many rules on business and charges billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also want Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. They also object to the idea of ""ever closer union"" and the belief that the ultimate goal is to create a ""United States of Europe"".David Cameron wants Britain to stay in the EU, once he has got some powers back from it. He has so far refused to say whether he would start calling for Britain to leave if he does not get what he wants from the other EU leaders. The Labour Party, SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems are also in favour of staying in. Latest opinion polls suggest 45% of the British public agree with them.They believe Britain gets a big boost from EU membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argue, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also believe Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving.It depends which way you look at it - or what you believe is important. Leaving the EU would be a big step - arguably far more important than who wins the next general election - but would it set the nation free or condemn it to economic ruin? Here is a rundown of the arguments for and against.Big business - with a few exceptions - tends to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. The CBI president and BT chief Sir Mike Rake says there are ""no credible alternatives"" to staying in the EU. But others disagree, such as Lord Bamford, chairman of JCB, who says an EU exit would allow the UK to negotiate trade deals as our country ""rather than being one of 28 nations"". Many small- and medium-sized firms would welcome a cut in red tape and what they see as petty regulations, but a lot hangs on what deal Mr Cameron renegotiates. The British Chambers of Commerce says 55% of members back staying in a reformed EU.Find out more: Business for Britain wants big changes to the UK's relations with the EU and says the UK should be prepared to vote to leave if the changes are not achievedBusiness for New Europe is a coalition of business leaders who support the UK's membership of the EU and ""oppose withdrawal to the margins"".The Electoral Commission will be in charge of making sure it's a fair contest.  There will be official ""Yes"" and ""No"" campaigns, selected by the Commission, which will have to abide by strict spending limits. Anyone wanting to launch their own Yes or No campaign will have to register with the Commission if they plan to spend more than £10,000. They must be UK-based. The Commission says MPs should decide what kinds of organisations should be allowed to take part. Business groups, trade unions and pressure groups are all likely to want to have their say.There will also be rules to prevent organisations trying to get round the spending limits through multiple registrations. Political parties will also be allowed to campaign for the result they want to see.Anyone who runs an unregistered campaign will be limited to spending less than £10,000. The idea is to prevent wealthy foreigners, companies or governments trying to influence the outcome. The Electoral Commission has published preliminary guidelines.That is yet to be decided and will partly depend on what Mr Cameron achieves in his renegotiation of the terms of the UK's membership of the EU. He says he is confident he can get what he wants, in which case he would be expected to lead the ""staying in"" side. The highest profile supporter of leaving the EU is UKIP leader Nigel Farage, but there are likely to be other high profile politicians who support withdrawal - or, as with the anti-euro campaign a few years back, celebrities or business people could front an ""anti-politics"" campaign.Conservatives' election manifesto - including referendum pledgeTry these features:How to win a referendumWhat David Cameron wants from the EU negotiationsTimeline: Campaigns for a European Union referendumBusinesses give their views on a possible EU exit"
2015-05-31,What Britain wants from Europe,https://web.archive.org//web/20150601103602/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32695399,"David Cameron says he has a mandate to pursue EU reform following the Conservatives' general election victory. The PM, who will be hoping his majority government will give him extra leverage in Brussels, wants to renegotiate the terms of the UK's membership ahead of a referendum by the end of 2017. He has said he will campaign for Britain to remain in the EU if he gets the reforms he wants.Mr Cameron has said he does not want to reveal full details of his negotiating hand but he has given a broad indication, in a series of speeches and newspaper articles, of his priorities when he goes into talks with other EU leaders.These are: The prime minister has said Britain would resist any move towards a European Army and that he wants to free British police forces from EU interference. He has also ruled out Britain joining the euro.But he has placed less emphasis in recent years on demanding changes to EU social policy, such as the maximum 48-hour working week, agency workers, maternity leave and non-discrimination rules.The official UK government position is that a referendum will be held by the end of 2017 but Downing Street sources have said: ""If we can do it earlier we will.""There is speculation David Cameron is planning to hold the vote in 2016 to avoid a clash with French and German elections in 2017.The prime minister wants treaty change but even if the referendum was held in 2017 there may not be enough time to legally incorporate any reforms into a treaty and it would have to be done at a later stage.An early referendum would anger Eurosceptics who believe it would not allow enough time to make the case for exit or negotiate any meaningful concessions.""A rushed process would severely undermine the chances to secure a significant deal that both British business and voters could support and would waste the opportunity of a lifetime,"" Matthew Elliott, chief executive of Business for Britain told Breitbart London.The question is always crucial in any referendum and there is already a debate about what it should be. The Draft European Union (Referendum) Bill, published by the Conservatives in 2013, proposed this form of words: ""Do you think that the United Kingdom should remain a member of the European Union?""Some thought that leaned too far towards the status quo, encouraging a yes vote, and the Electoral Commission said it was not clear and direct enough. The watchdog proposed this form of words instead: ""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union?""The new Conservative government will attempt to repeal the Human Rights Act, which requires UK courts to treat the European Court of Human Rights as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. The European Court of Human Rights is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe (CoE), which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine.The freedom for people to move around Europe, enshrined in the EU treaties, works in parallel with the other three basic freedoms in the single market: freedom of goods, capital and services.It is likely to be a ""red line"" for other EU leaders, who do not want to see it eroded.Mr Cameron has steered clear of tackling it directly - for example by asking for an emergency ""brake"" on free movement, or a cap on numbers - focusing instead on reducing the incentive provided by welfare payments. In a speech last November, David Cameron set out measures to reduce the number of EU nationals moving to the UK.His main proposals were:Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission, has said he is ready to work with Mr Cameron to ""strike a fair deal for the United Kingdom in the EU"". The leaders of other EU nations have previously warned they are unlikely to support major changes to EU treaties to accommodate British demands. But Mr Cameron's general election victory may have given him extra leverage. ""The ball is very much in the court of the UK now,"" a senior EU official told The Guardian. ""It's up to the British to define what they want."" The key figure will be German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is very keen to keep Britain in the EU but has so far been unwilling to make major concessions to enable that to happen. There are fears that a ""pick and mix"" approach to EU treaties would undermine EU cohesion.Mr Cameron has said there is ""no doubt"" his planned reforms will require changes to the treaties governing the European Union. But this would require the unanimous support of all EU members, and may not be possible within the deadline he has set of a referendum before the end of 2017. Any attempt to change EU laws on free movement would meet fierce resistance from some EU nations, particularly Eastern European states. Mr Juncker has said free movement is non-negotiable.Mr Cameron may find it difficult to get unanimous support for his proposals for a four-year waiting period for migrant workers claiming UK benefits. East European EU members would be likely to oppose this, on the grounds that it would discriminate against their citizens.  Attempts to secure opt-outs for the City are unlikely to go down well with other European leaders.However, there are precedents for EU treaty changes to accommodate some countries' specific concerns - for example, the protocol attached to the Lisbon Treaty for Ireland.Mr Cameron has faced repeated calls to say whether he would campaign for Britain's exit from the EU in the referendum if he fails to get what he wants from the renegotiation process. All he has said is that he will ""rule nothing out"". Some Conservative MPs want Britain to leave the EU no matter what David Cameron manages to renegotiate. A larger group are likely to want more concessions than Mr Cameron has so far indicated he is prepared to demand.Senior backbencher David Davis, who was defeated by Mr Cameron for the Tory leadership in 2005, told the Daily Telegraph the majority of the 332 Conservative MPs want Mr Cameron to negotiate an ""opt-out"" power to stop individual EU laws from applying to Britain. The prime minister has said this would be ""impossible"" without Britain leaving the EU.Mr Davis claims as many as 60 Tory MPs would be prepared to rebel and vote for Britain's exit from the EU if the prime minister fails to deliver.Graham Brady, chairman of the Tory backbench 1922 committee, which represents backbenchers, has urged David Cameron to give all Conservative MPs, including ministers, a free vote in the EU referendum.In January, Mr Cameron warned that serving cabinet ministers would have to quit the government if they wanted to campaign to leave the EU if he had secured the reforms to it he wants.In the 1975 referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Economic Community, as the EU was then called, Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson decided to suspend collective responsibility because his cabinet was split on the issue. Ministers were allowed to vote with their consciences and campaign against each other. The majority of them, including Mr Wilson, joined the Yes camp, but left-wingers, such as Tony Benn, played a leading role in the No campaign. The Yes campaign won easily with 67% of the vote."
2015-05-31,UK and the EU: Better off out or in?,https://web.archive.org//web/20150601103602/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32793642,"David Cameron has promised a referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Union by the end of 2017. Here is a summary of the key arguments for and against British membership.If Britain votes to leave the EU, it will have to negotiate a new trading relationship with what would now be a 27 member organisation, to allow British firms to sell goods and services to EU countries without being hit by excessive tariffs and other restrictions.Better off out: Britain could negotiate an ""amicable divorce"", but retain strong trading links with EU nations, say those campaigning for Britain's exit. There are several potential scenarios:Better off in: An ""amicable divorce"" is a pipe dream, pro-EU campaigners argue. France, Germany and other leading EU nations would never allow Britain a ""pick and mix"" approach to the bloc's rules. Norway and Switzerland have to abide by many EU rules without any influence over how they are formed. Negotiating a comprehensive free trade agreement could take years and have an uncertain outcome. And if Britain went for a completely clean break with the EU its exports would be subject to tariffs and would still have to meet EU production standards, harming the competitiveness of British business.The run-up to the EU referendum is likely to be dominated by competing claims about how many millions of jobs will be lost or gained by Britain's exit. All such claims come with a health warning. Coming up with a precise figure is difficult as there is no way of knowing if threats by foreign companies to scale back their operations in the UK would come to pass or, indeed, how many jobs would be created by the reshaped economy that might emerge in the wake of an exit.Better off out: There would be a jobs boom as firms are freed from EU regulations and red tape, say those arguing for an exit, with small- and medium-sized companies who don't trade with the EU benefiting the most. In its recent paper, the EU Jobs Myth, the free market Institute for Economic Affairs seeks to debunk the claim that 3-4 million jobs would be lost if Britain left. ""Jobs are associated with trade, not membership of a political union, and there is little evidence to suggest that trade would substantially fall between British businesses and European consumers in the event the UK was outside the EU,"" it argues. ""The UK labour market is incredibly dynamic, and would adapt quickly to changed relationships with the EU.""Better off in: Millions of jobs would be lost as global manufacturers moved to lower-cost EU countries. Britain's large, foreign-owned car industry would be particularly at risk. ""The attractiveness of the UK as a place to invest and do automotive business is clearly underpinned by the UK's influential membership of the EU,"" said a KPMG report on the car industry last year. The financial services sector, which employs about 2.1 million people in the UK, also has concerns about a British exit. ""The success of the UK financial services industry is to a large extent built on EU Internal Market legislation. To abandon this for some untried, unknown and unpredictable alternative would carry very significant risks,"" said global law firm Clifford Chance in a report by think tank TheCityUK last year.Much would depend on the trade deals Britain managed to negotiate with the EU and rest of the world after its exit. The best-case scenario, according to think tank Open Europe, is that the UK would be better off by 1.6% of GDP a year by 2030. That is assuming the UK carried out widespread deregulation after its exit and managed to strike favourable trade deals. The think tank adds: ""A far more realistic range is between a 0.8% permanent loss to GDP in 2030 and a 0.6% permanent gain in GDP in 2030, in scenarios where Britain mixes policy approaches"".The Centre for Economic Performance, at the London School of Economics, says the worst-case scenario is a 6.3% to 9.5% reduction in GDP, ""a loss of a similar size to that resulting from the global financial crisis of 2008/09"". The best case, according to their analysis, is a loss of 2.2% of GDP.Better off out: Britain would regain full control of its borders. UKIP wants to see a work permit system introduced, so that EU nationals would face the same visa restrictions as those from outside the EU, which it says would reduce population growth from current levels of 298,000 a year to about 50,000. This would create job opportunities for British workers and boost wages, as well as easing pressure on schools, hospitals and other public services. Better off in: Britain might have to agree to allow free movement of EU migrants as the price of being allowed access to the free market. In any case, immigration from the rest of the EU has been good for Britain's economy. The UK's growth forecasts are based, in part, on continued high levels of net migration. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility says the economy relies on migrant labour and taxes paid by immigrants to keep funding public services.The UK's net contribution to the EU, taking into account the rebate, was £11.3bn in 2013. That is more than four times what it was in 2008. It is about the same amount as the UK government spends on transport every year.Better off out: The UK would save billions in membership fees, and end the ""hidden tariff"" paid by UK taxpayers when goods are exported to the EU, caused by red tape, waste, fraud and other factors. Better off in: The UK's contribution to the EU budget is a drop in the ocean compared with the benefits to business of being in the single market. Better off out: The EU is not as important to British trade as it used to be, and continuing turmoil in the eurozone will make it even less so. Even if Britain did not manage to negotiate a free trade deal with the EU it would not be as disastrous as EU-enthusiasts claim, argues economist Roger Bootle in his book The Trouble with Europe: ""It would place the UK in the same position as the US is currently in, along with India, China and Japan, all of which manage to export to the EU relatively easily."" The UK would be free to establish bilateral trade agreements with fast-growing export markets such as China, Singapore, Brazil, Russia and India through the World Trade Organisation. Better off in: The EU is the UK's main trading partner, worth more than £400bn a year, or 52% of the total trade in goods and services. Complete withdrawal from the EU would see trade barriers erected, with car exports to the EU, for example, facing a 15% tariff and imports a tariff of 10%.  ""The idea that the UK would be freer outside the EU is based on a series of misconceptions, that a medium-sized, open economy could hold sway in an increasingly fractured trading system dominated by the US, the EU and China; that the EU makes it harder for Britain to penetrate emerging markets; and that foreign capital would be more attracted to Britain's economy if it were no longer part of the single market,"" the pro-EU Centre for European Reform said in a recent report.Better off out: The UK would remain a key part of Nato and the UN Security Council and a nuclear power, with a powerful global voice in its own right. The Eurosceptic Bruges Group wants an end to the ""discredited"" principle that Britain acts as a transatlantic bridge between the US and Europe, saying the country should make self-reliance its guiding principle.Better off in: Stripped of influence in Brussels, Berlin and Paris, Britain would find itself increasingly ignored by Washington and sidelined on big transnational issues such as the environment, security and trade. America and other allies want Britain to remain in the EU. The UK risks becoming a maverick, isolated state if it leaves.Better off out: Britain would gain full control of its own borders, with migration in and out of the country regulated solely by British law. It would be more difficult for EU citizens to move to the UK, although those already living here are unlikely to be removed. Better off in: A lot would depend on what kind of deal was reached with the other EU nations. Britons may have to apply for visas to enter EU countries and those already living there may face integration rules, such as proving they can speak the language before gaining long-term residency rights. There would also be uncertainty for many EU workers now paying taxes in the UK - what benefits, if any, would they be entitled to?Better off out: The EU has limited power over tax, which is largely a matter for national governments. The exception is VAT, which has bands agreed at the EU level. Outside the EU, the UK would potentially have more flexibility.Better off in:  ""Tax avoidance and evasion will reach crippling levels as our economy becomes increasingly wholly owned by foreign multinationals that make tax avoidance in Britain central to their business strategy,"" argued the pro-European The Observer newspaper in an editorial.Better off out: It would be a major shot in the arm for British democracy as the Westminster parliament regained its sovereignty and reconnected with voters. The country would be free from the European Arrest Warrant and other law and order measures.Better off in: Britons benefit from EU employment laws and social protections, which would be stripped away. Withdrawal from the European Arrest Warrant could mean delays for the UK in extraditing suspects from other European countries; and the UK already has some opt-outs from EU labour law, including the Working Time Directive."
2015-05-31,Childcare winners,https://web.archive.org//web/20150601103602/http://www.bbc.com/news/education-32956512,"Any working parent will tell you the cost of childcare burns a massive hole in the family wallet. So to many, the prospect of a free 30-hours-a-week will sound like a fantastic offer. But when the government, in other words the taxpayer, is footing the bill for a policy, there are other questions. Such as what does it expect to get back from spending the money, other than a lot of grateful parents? In this case, we are not starting with a blank sheet. All three and four-year-olds in England are already entitled to the equivalent of 15 free hours a week in term time. So we might expect in these times of tighter public spending that a detailed evaluation is under way by the Treasury. If so, it is being conducted in such secrecy that they couldn't share the information with the Lords Select Committee on Affordable Childcare. They weren't able to persuade a Treasury minister or official to give evidence to their recent inquiry. As the committee said in its final report in February: ""No hierarchy of policy objectives was provided in the written evidence from HM Treasury."" In other words, it is not clear exactly what increasing free childcare is expected to deliver. In the past, ministers have suggested that making childcare more financially accessible would encourage a greater number of women into the labour market. Whatever you think of this as a broader societal benefit, it does have potential gains in terms of tax revenues and potentially reducing the lifelong income gap between men and women. But the effect seems to be very modest, according to the academics who have done the most comprehensive review of the impact of the free 15 hours for all three and four-year-olds. Dr Claire Crawford, research fellow at the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies, described the impact as ""reasonably small"".""We found that around two percentage points more women were in work compared with before the scheme. That's the equivalent of about 12,000 more women in work,"" she said.When they looked more closely, it seemed that was because many three and four-year-olds were already in some kind of childcare. So the cost of around £1.9bn a year largely delivered a cash benefit to working mothers.  But what about the children? Learning and playing in a safe environment with other children can help develop social skills that are useful for beginning school. There is evidence that for children from poorer backgrounds, high-quality childcare can help narrow an attainment gap that will otherwise limit their life chances. Quality, of course, can be defined in many different ways. For the very smallest children, having kind, patient, caring staff who can give them attention is a good start. But among academics, there is a consensus that quality means qualified. Private and voluntary nursery and pre-school settings are considerably less likely to employ a graduate with early years training because of the cost. There were 1.9 million children, under the age of five, receiving some form of childcare or early education during term time in England in 2012. Of those, 1.6 million received formal provision.Use of childcare is particularly high among three to four-year-olds, of whom 88% (1.18 million) received formal childcare or early education in 2012, compared with 37% (429,570) of nought to two-year-olds.As at September 2013, there were more than 25,000 nurseries and pre-schools, providing education and care to more than one million children aged nought to five; 54,000 childminders cared for a further 270,000. Added to this, 290,000 three-year-olds and 45,000 two-year-olds received education and care in maintained schools.During the election campaign, Save the Children pointed out that two in five private or not-for-profit nurseries don't have a graduate on their staff. So expanding hours alone won't help close that gap for children early in life. Which brings us back to the 30 hours being offered to all three and four-year-olds where both parents are in work. There is an opportunity for the government to drive up standards by insisting that only those places rated good or outstanding can provide the extra hours. There is a challenge too, with many in the pre-school sector saying they are already cross-subsidising the free hours by charging more for younger children or the remaining hours. It is an argument the government has accepted to the extent of promising an increase in the average rate. By how much could be crucial to getting enough pre-school providers to take part in the extended scheme. "
2015-05-31,Whistle-stop tour,https://web.archive.org//web/20150601103602/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-32942086,"There was a lot of talk of shuttle diplomacy this week and of David Cameron's ""whistle-stop tour of Europe"", but in the end the British prime minister actually only popped in to four European capitals between Thursday morning and Friday afternoon.So did the trip merit the fanfare? Was it a success?Well, when the most powerful woman in the world (that is, Angela Merkel) responds to the prime minister's wish-list for a different kind of EU with ""where there's a will there's a way"" and says that, yes, treaty change might indeed be possible - that must sound like success to him. The European tour this week served a definite purpose. In the long run-up to the UK general election, David Cameron and his ministers irritated a fair few by grandstanding and performing to the Eurosceptic gallery at home while abroad on EU business.This was a chance to try to repair burned bridges.Before the nitty-gritty and sometimes probably nasty process of negotiating a new EU relationship for Britain, this was a chance for the prime minister to say to other leaders: ""Look, this is not about the UK versus the rest of Europe. We do have a lot in common.""What Europe's leaders want to feel from Britain as its seeks to change the EU is that this is a process, not a diktat. In this pre-negotiation stage, tone is as important as content. So, in Paris, Mr Cameron carefully listed issues where France and Britain stand side-by-side; while in the Netherlands, he described the country as an old friend and like-minded ally. Mr Cameron needs other EU leaders onside to pass meaningful reforms.This week's four tour stops were carefully chosen. The Netherlands and Germany are generally UK-friendly: open to more competitiveness, a stronger single market and less red tape. France is trickier but, alongside Germany, a traditional EU heavyweight - and therefore a must-visit - while Poland is the emerging new EU power. It is Britain's ally over tough sanctions against Russia but, as we saw in the rather uncomfortable meeting with Prime Minister Ewa Kopacz on Friday, Poland will be a fierce opponent of scrapping migrant benefits. On his travels David Cameron found a widespread appetite for change. The tricky part will be persuading other EU leaders that his way is the best way.But when it comes to the EU's most powerful country, Germany, the details of this trip were less important.Chancellor Merkel, ever the pragmatist, has an eye on the big picture - Europe on the world stage. She worries that the EU without the British economy, the British military and British diplomatic expertise is weaker and more fragmented in the face of a ruthlessly ambitious China and, in particular, having grown up in communist East Germany, of a newly aggressive Russia just next door.Angela Merkel, normally so risk averse, was uncharacteristically outspoken standing side-by-side with David Cameron.""I want to find a solution,"" she said to him.And generally in the EU, when Germany speaks, others follow. "
2015-05-31,Seeing eye-to-eye?,https://web.archive.org//web/20150601103602/http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-eu-32929957,"""David Cameron has to be realistic,"" said Poland's Europe Minister Rafal Trzaskowski, ""and I'm sure he will be"".It is a message Mr Cameron will hear repeated in capitals across the continent as he sets out on his campaign to renegotiate the UK's role in the European Union. After a brief breakfast meeting with his Polish counterpart Ewa Kopacz, at a former royal palace in Warsaw, the British prime minister will be in no doubt about Poland's position.Any British attempt to restrict the rights of migrant workers from other EU countries while they are in the UK will be resisted. Abuse of the welfare system is a different matter. On that issue, progress can and will be made. But suggestions that Mr Cameron might seek to prevent other EU citizens claiming in-work benefits such as tax credits are seen as unacceptable.""We can't accept discrimination,"" Mr Trzaskowski said, ""it's a red line"".There are other issues, though, on which Poland and the UK clearly see eye-to-eye. After Mr Cameron's meeting with Mrs Kopacz, a Downing Street spokesperson said: ""There was much they could agree on - making Europe more competitive by strengthening the single market, cutting back red tape, ensuring fairness between euro-ins and euro-outs and more subsidiarity, respecting the sovereignty of member states.""The Poles will welcome British efforts to guarantee that the interests of EU countries outside the eurozone are protected. The notion that national parliaments should play a more active role in assessing EU legislation will also find favour. But the big political change in Poland this week has not been in parliament but in the presidency. The conservative Andrzej Duda has - rather surprisingly - been elected president, after gaining strong support from a younger generation of voters.  Mr Duda was the candidate of the Law and Justice Party, which belongs to the same political group as the British Conservatives in the European Parliament. ""We are strongly against building an artificial European federal state,"" Jaroslaw Sellin from Law and Justice told me. ""We need to co-operate as independent countries within the EU, and the main focus should always be on the economy."" In other words there is plenty of political opinion in Poland that David Cameron can appeal to. But British renegotiation needs to be based on the idea of working together, not on dictating terms - that won't work, in Warsaw or elsewhere. David Cameron is starting renegotiation of the terms of Britain's EU membership ahead of a referendum. Here is some further reading on what it all means: What Britain wants from EuropeThe UK and the EU: Better off in or out?EU reform: What's in it for the others?"
2015-05-31,UKIP v Labour,https://web.archive.org//web/20150601103602/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32928391,"The fight between Labour and UKIP is heading to Wales. Nigel Farage's party is challenging in seats where Labour traditionally dominate at the general election, and it could be on course for electoral success there within the year.Voters in Caerphilly have always elected Labour MPs. But on 7 May this was one of 120 constituencies where UKIP came second, and soon there will be another election here on terms likely to suit Nigel Farage's party.Professor Roger Scully, of Cardiff University, tells BBC Radio 4's the World at One that at the moment UKIP are on course to win six or seven seats in the Welsh Assembly next year.The campaign here will be one of the first jobs on the to-do list of a new Labour leader, and will pose a fundamental question: what should Labour do about the threat from UKIP?The voting system for the Assembly election next year combines first-past-the-post contests and proportional representation, giving smaller parties like UKIP a much better chance than in Westminster contests.Sam Gould was UKIP's candidate in Caerphilly at the general election, winning almost a fifth of the vote, its most improved result in Wales.A former Labour voter, he has only joined UKIP in the last year. A few months ago the party had no presence in the town.Showing me around the Lansbury Park estate there, he says: ""We've only been organised as a party for a matter of three months and so for us to get to 20% of the vote after only organising ourselves and running a three month campaign is tremendous. So what can we do in a year?""There has never been a rush to vote Tory in much of south east Wales. The legacy of mines long since closed still marks the landscape, politics and cultural identity of the area. But Professor Scully says that doesn't guarantee an unchanging allegiance to the Labour party.He says: ""There was an element of the Labour vote in the South Wales valleys, an element of sort of socially conservative working class voters in much of Wales, that was unenthusiastic Labour and that was ready and waiting you might say for UKIP to come along and try to attract them.""You might think that a deeply worrying analysis for the Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones. Yet he appears far from panicked, instead suggesting other parties will suffer at UKIP's hands.He says: ""All the opinion polls seem to suggest that the seats would come from other parties not from us, bearing in mind we have 30 out of the 60 seats and 28 of them are first past the post.  ""In terms of losing seats in the proportional representation section, actually it's other parties that would lose the seats other than ourselves.""Labour's near-wipe-out in Scotland is recent, raw and devastating. It seemed unthinkable, until it happened. Wales' politics are very different; neither UKIP nor the Welsh nationalists Plaid Cymru have enjoyed an SNP-like surge. But after its Scottish trauma Labour must wonder whether the party in Wales - and its leader - accused by opponents of taking traditional support for granted and facing fresh threats, could suffer a similar fate.The Welsh First Minister says the possibility is ""always there in the forefront of our minds"".But he adds: ""We wanted to make sure that people saw us as a party that would stand up for Wales, a party that was devolutionist in its outlook while at the same time not a party that supported independence and that was the basis for our success in 2011. ""In Scotland I get the impression that Scottish Labour went the other way and left that contested ground to the SNP. It's not a mistake that we're going to make.""He suggests Labour's leaders in Scotland made errors that he has already managed to avoid. His analysis will be tested by voters in Wales next May. With Scottish and London Mayoral and Assembly elections due on the same day, it could be a moment to help demonstrate whether Labour has learned how to win back voters, or whether it has been abandoned by some of its traditional supporters for good."
2015-05-31,Legal challenge,https://web.archive.org//web/20150601103602/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-32930228,"An online appeal to raise funds for a legal challenge to the election of Orkney and Shetland MP Alistair Carmichael has raised more than £42,000 in four days.The People Versus Carmichael was launched on crowdfunding site Indiegogo by ""residents of Orkney and Shetland who are disappointed in the behaviour of their MP and want our politics conducted honestly and without smears"".Its stated goal is to ""raise an election petition in the courts"". It says: ""This could begin a process which could have the recent result in Orkney and Shetland overturned."" Mr Carmichael has been the Liberal Democrat MP for Orkney and Shetland since 2001. Before the general election he was Scottish secretary, a cabinet minister in the UK government.It was a position of power and influence that gave him access to confidential government documents.On 3 April, during the election campaign, the Daily Telegraph reported a leaked memo which gave an account of a private conversation between Nicola Sturgeon and the French Ambassador which suggested that the SNP leader wanted Tory leader David Cameron to remain prime minister.Ms Sturgeon denied the account and demanded an inquiry into the leak. The Cabinet Office inquiry concluded that Mr Carmichael and his special advisor Euan Roddin were responsible for the leak. When asked about the leak at the time, Carmichael said: ""The first I heard of this was when I received a phone call from a journalist"".In a letter of apology, Mr Carmichael said: ""Had I still been a government minister I would have considered this to be a matter that required my resignation. I have therefore informed the Cabinet Secretary that I will decline my ministerial severance payment.""For many this sanction is not enough and they feel he is not fit to be an MP.Those behind the crowdfunding petition says they want to hold Mr Carmichael ""accountable for his behaviour before, during and after the election campaign"".They are hoping to raise enough money for a legal challenge under the Representation of the People Act 1983.It states that electors or disappointed candidates can question the result of a parliamentary election if a candidate or their agents engage in ""corrupt or illegal practices"". The practices set out in the act include bribery (making illegal payments) and paying canvassers.Whether Mr Carmichael's actions are covered by  ""corrupt or illegal practices"" is the matter a court would have to decide.Last month the election of the Mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, was voided for a range of breaches of election law including voting fraud, false statements, bribery and spiritual influence, telling Bengali voters it was their ""religious duty"" to vote for him.However, the case of Labour's Phil Woolas in the 2010 general election is perhaps more relevant.He was removed from his Oldham East and Saddleworth seat for circulating lies about the personal character of his Liberal Democratic opponent during the general election campaign. He was the first MP to lose his seat in this way for almost a century. The specially convened election court ruled that comments in campaign material suggesting Lib Dem candidate Elwyn Watkins had tried to ""woo"" the votes of Muslim extremists clearly amounted to an attack on his personal character and conduct.Section 106 of the Representation of the People Act states that a person who ""makes or publishes any false statement of fact in relation to the candidate's personal character or conduct shall be guilty of an illegal practice, unless he can show that he had reasonable grounds for believing, and did believe, that statement to be true"".Alistair Carmichael, who won the Orkney and Shetland seat with a majority of just 817 votes, says he believed at the time that he authorised the leak that the comments made about Ms Sturgeon in the memo were a true account of her conversation.Christine O'Neill, chairman of Brodies LLP and expert in public law, told BBC Scotland: ""One issue here of course is that the first minister (Nicola Sturgeon) was not a candidate in this election.  ""The false statement must have been made with the aim of influencing the outcome of the election - and in order to see the successful candidate unseated it is also necessary to show that there was an actual impact on the outcome of the election.""There are few election petitions and fewer which are successful.  One of the most recent cases on false statements makes it clear that there is a distinction between saying something false about a candidate's personal conduct and character and making false statements about their political activities or conduct.""In the months before the end of the last parliament the Recall of MPs Act 2015 was given Royal Assent.It allows for a recall petition to be triggered if a MP is sentenced to a prison term or is suspended from the House of Commons for at least 21 sitting days. If 10% of the eligible electors in the MP's constituency signed a petition, the seat would be declared vacant and a by-election would follow. Mr Carmichael has not been convicted of a criminal offence or suspended from the House of Commons so this new law would not apply."
2015-05-31,Claptrap,https://web.archive.org//web/20150601103602/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32913113,"Britain's Parliament has some pretty bizarre rules - as the new intake of SNP MPs found out when they were given a stern warning for clapping during the Queen's Speech debate. So why is applause banned in the Commons?You can wave your order papers, shout until you are purple in the face, hurl abuse across the Chamber, join in with frankly weird displays of mass groaning or that elongated ""hear, hear"" thing they do.But try joining your party comrades in a sincere appreciation of a point well made in the traditional way and you will have Speaker John Bercow on his feet telling you to respect the traditions of the House.At least, that's what the 56 new SNP MPs found on Wednesday, when they broke into applause to support Angus Robertson, their leader at Westminster, who was hitting back at a furious attack on the party by Labour MP Ian Austin.""May I say at the start of the Parliament,"" said Mr Bercow, ""that the convention that we do not clap in this Chamber is very, very long established and widely respected, and it would be appreciated if Members showed some respect for that convention.""They will get their speaking rights from this Chair - of that they can be assured. They will be respected, but I would invite them to show some respect for the traditions of this Chamber of the House of Commons.""But like many other things in Britain's elasticated, unwritten constitution, the no-clapping convention is there to be broken.The most famous occasion was on the 27 July, 2007 when Tony Blair gave his farewell speech to the House of Commons.With wavering voice, the outgoing Labour prime minister admitted he was not really a Commons man, but he respected the place and the ""noble"" profession of politics, and with a final thespian flourish spoke his final words to the Chamber: ""I wish everyone, friend or foe, well and that's that, the end."" A ripple of applause on the Labour benches soon spread across the floor before turning into an unprecedented cross-party standing ovation.  It was an extraordinary scene - and one the then Speaker Michael Martin did nothing to stop.John Bercow himself has not always enforced the no-clapping rule as vigorously as he did on Wednesday.When the previous government mounted a last minute attempt to oust him as Speaker, on the final day of Parliament in March this year, Tory MP and friend of the speaker Charles Walker delivered an emotional speech denouncing what he saw as the underhand tactics of then-chief whip Michael Gove.The Speaker's supporters got to their feet to give Mr Walker a standing ovation.  A clearly overcome Mr Bercow let it go.Making a noise with the hands to show appreciation or disapproval is as old as civilisation itself.In ancient Rome, clapping was part of a repertoire of gestures, including the snapping of the finger and thumb and the flapping of togas, used by audiences at public performances.In French theatre, groups of professional clappers, known as ""claques"", were hired by performers to make them appear more popular with audiences.In politics, the length of the ovation at the end of a speech is sometimes seen as a sign of how well it went down.This took on a more sinister dimension in Soviet Russia, when party leaders would give long speeches with orchestrated applause and ovations.In the book Gulag Archipelago, author Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn recalls how someone toasted Stalin at a local Communist Party conference and ""stormy applause, rising to an ovation"", broke out. The great leader was not present but the applause continued regardless. ""Palms were getting sore and raised arms were already aching... however, who would dare be the first to stop?""So why is applause normally banned in the Commons?There is certainly plenty of claptrap spoken in the House (in the traditional sense of the word, meaning something designed to elicit applause).But MPs and members of the House of Lords are encouraged to find other outlets for their approval, mainly through the shouting of ""hear, hear!"", which started life in the 17th Century as a cry of ""hear him! hear him!"".The rules are laid out in the Parliamentary etiquette bible Erskine May, which says: ""Members must not disturb a Member who is speaking by hissing, chanting, clapping, booing, exclamations or other interruption."" But it adds: ""When not uttered till the end of a sentence, the cry of 'hear, hear,' offers no interruption of the speech."" MPs are well aware of how absurd this can sound to the uninitiated.The modernisation committee, set up by Tony Blair's government in an effort to drag the Commons into the 20th Century, said new MPs found it ""incomprehensible that it is not in order to clap at the end of a speech, a practice which is commonplace in other gatherings and indeed in other Parliaments"".But the committee backed the applause ban in a 1998 report:  ""While we agree that spontaneous clapping at the end of a speech could in no way be interpreted as disturbance of the speaker, there is a danger that such a practice might be open to abuse and could lead in certain circumstances to orchestration of what would amount to standing ovations with the success or failure of a speech being judged not by its content but by the relative length of the ovation at the end.""This might not disrupt an individual speech, but would disrupt the tenor of the debate, as indeed would slow handclapping.""So it looks as if MPs will have to continue sitting on their hands. And the SNP will have to find a new way to show their appreciation."
